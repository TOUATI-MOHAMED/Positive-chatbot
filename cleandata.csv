Whether you can’t get motivated to clean your house or you just aren’t feeling motivated to lose weight, a lack of motivation can be the biggest obstacle to reaching your goals.
 
When you have no motivation to complete a task (or even start one), consider the possible reasons why you’re struggling. Then, develop a plan to help motivate yourself to get going.
 
Keep in mind that not every strategy works for everyone—or in every situation. Perform some behavioral experiments to see which strategies best help you reach your goals.
 
Sometimes, no motivation can be the problem. At other times, it’s merely the symptom of a bigger problem.
 
For example, if you’re a perfectionist, your lack of motivation may stem from fear that you won’t complete a task flawlessly. Until you address this need to be perfect, your motivation isn’t likely to increase.
 
At other times, your lack of motivation may cause you to procrastinate. And the more you procrastinate, the less motivated you feel. In this case, improving your motivation to get work done can help you feel better and perform better.
 
So it’s important to take a few minutes to consider why you might have trouble motivating yourself. Here are some common reasons for a lack of motivation:
 
These are just a few common reasons why people sometimes lack motivation. You might find that your lack of motivation stems from other issues, like the fear of what people think or a desire to please everyone. So carefully consider the underlying thoughts and feelings that are affecting your drive.
 
You may be able to trick yourself into feeling motivated by changing your behavior. Act as if you felt motivated, and your actions may change your emotions.
 
For example, rather than sit on the couch in your pajamas all day waiting for motivation to strike, get dressed and get moving. You might find that taking action will increase your motivation, which makes it easier to keep going. 
 So ask yourself, “What would I be doing right now if I felt motivated?” Consider what you’d be wearing, how you’d be thinking, and what actions you’d be taking. Then, do these things, and see if your motivation level increases. 
When you’re struggling with motivation, you’ll likely come up with a long list of reasons why you shouldn’t take any action. You might think, “It’ll be too hard,” or, “I’ll never get it done anyway.” These types of thoughts will keep you stuck.
 
Try arguing the opposite. When you think you’re going to fail, argue all the reasons why you might succeed. Or when you think you can’t finish a job, list all the evidence that shows you’ll be able to complete the task.
 
Arguing the opposite can help you see both ends of the spectrum. It can also remind you that an overly pessimistic outcome isn’t completely accurate.
 
There’s a chance that things might work out better than you expect. And you might find that developing a more balanced outlook will help you feel more motivated to try.
 
You might think being hard on yourself is the key to getting motivated. But harsh self-criticism doesn’t work.
 
Research shows that self-compassion is actually much more motivating, especially when you are struggling with adversity.
 
A 2011 study﻿﻿ conducted by researchers at the University of California found that self-compassion increases the motivation to recover from failure. After failing a test, students spent more time studying when they spoke to themselves kindly. Additionally, they reported greater motivation to change their weaknesses when they practiced self-acceptance (a key component of self-compassion).
 
Self-compassion may also improve mental health (which can increase motivation). A 2012 study﻿﻿ published in Clinical Psychology Review discovered that self-compassion decreases psychological distress, reduces the symptoms of anxiety and depression, and reduces the harmful effects of stress.
 So rather than beat yourself up for mistakes or call yourself names, create a kinder inner dialogue. This doesn’t mean you need to repeat exaggeratedly positive affirmations like, “I’m the best person in the world,” however. Instead, healthy self-compassion balances self-acceptance with self-improvement. Acknowledge your flaws, mistakes, and failures with honesty. But don’t indulge in a pity party. 
Speak to yourself like a trusted friend. Ask yourself, “What would I say to a friend who had this problem?” You’d likely be much kinder to someone else than you are toward yourself. So start treating yourself like a good friend.
 
Additionally, coach yourself in a helpful manner. Practice using self-talk that encourages you and helps you recover from setbacks.
 
When you dread doing something—like walking on the treadmill for three miles—you’ll lack motivation to do it. You can reduce your feelings of dread, however, by proving to yourself that the task isn’t as bad as you think or that you have the strength to tolerate it better than you envision.
 
The 10-minute rule can help you get started. Give yourself permission to quit a task after 10 minutes. When you reach the 10-minute mark, ask yourself if you want to keep going or quit. You’ll likely find that you have enough motivation to keep going.
 
So whether you lack motivation to start working on a boring report, or you can’t seem to get yourself off the couch to start a to-do list, use the 10-minute rule to motivate yourself to take action.
 
Getting started on a task is usually the hardest part. Once you get going, however, it’s much easier to keep going.
 
Fresh air, a change of scenery, and a little exercise, can do wonders for your motivation. Walking in nature—as opposed to a busy urban street—can be especially beneficial.
 
A 2013 study﻿﻿ published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that walking half a mile through a park reduces brain fatigue. Being in nature offers a calming effect that rejuvenates the brain—which can help motivate you to tackle a tough task.
 
So rather than walk down a crowded street, go to the park or a botanical garden instead. Being surrounded by nature can provide the mental escape you need to return to your project feeling more motivated than before.
 
Your emotions play a major role in your motivation level. If you’re sad, bored, lonely, or anxious, your desire to tackle a tough challenge or complete a tedious task will suffer.
 
Boost your mood by adding a little fun to something you’re not motivated to do. You’ll feel happier, and you might even look forward to doing the task, when it’s regularly paired with something fun.
 
Here are some examples:
 
Just make sure that your fun doesn’t impair your performance. For example, watching TV while writing a paper might distract you and slow you down even more. Or talking to a friend while you’re cleaning the house might be so distracting that you can’t pay attention to what you’re doing.
 
It’s tough to feel motivated when your to-do list is overwhelming. If you feel like there’s no hope in getting everything done, you might not try to do anything.
 Keep in mind that most people underestimate how long something will take them. And when they don’t get it done on time, they might view themselves as lazy or inefficient. This can backfire by causing them to lose motivation—which makes it even harder to get more things done. 
Take a look at your to-do list, and determine if it’s too long. If so, get rid of tasks that aren’t essential.
 
See if other tasks can be moved to a different day. Prioritize the most important things on the list, and move those to the top.
 
You might find a slight change in your to-do list—or the way you view your to-do list—will help you to see your tasks as more manageable. As a result, you might feel more motivated to get to work.
 
You’ll struggle with motivation as long as you aren’t caring for yourself. Sleep-deprivation, a poor diet, and lack of leisure time, are just a few things that can make trudging through the day more difficult than ever.
 
Create a healthy self-care plan that allows you to take care of your mind and body:
 
Create a small reward for yourself that you can earn for your hard work. You might find focusing on the reward helps you stay motivated to reach your goals.
 
For example, if you have a long paper to write for class, you might tackle it in several different ways:
 
Consider whether you are likely to be more motivated by smaller, more frequent rewards or a bigger reward for a complete job. You may want to experiment with a few different strategies until you discover an approach that works best for you.
 
Make sure your rewards don’t sabotage your efforts, however. Rewarding your hard work at the gym with a sugary treat might be counterproductive. And counterproductive bad habits will decrease your motivation in the long term.
 
If your motivation remains low for two or more weeks, seek professional help. You may also want to seek help if your lack of motivation is affecting your daily functioning. For example, if you aren’t able to go to work, your performance at work is suffering, or if you can’t get motivated to leave the house, this could be a sign of something more serious.
 
Schedule an appointment with your physician. Your doctor may want to rule out physical health conditions that may be affecting your energy or mood.
 
Your doctor may also refer you to a mental health professional to determine if your lack of motivation might be related to a mental illness, like depression. If so, treatment may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.
 
Everyone struggles with motivation issues at one time or another. The way you respond to your lack of motivation is what matters, however. Be kind to yourself, experiment with strategies that increase your motivation, and ask for help if you need it.
 Avoidance of discomfort. Whether you don’t want to feel bored when doing a mundane task, or you are trying to avoid feelings of frustration by dodging a tough challenge, sometimes a lack of motivation stems from a desire to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Self-doubt. When you think you can’t do something—or are convinced you can’t tolerate the distress associated with a certain task—you’ll likely struggle to get started. Being over-extended. When you have a lot going on in life, you’ll likely feel overwhelmed. And this feeling can zap your motivation. Lack of commitment to a goal. Agreeing to a task simply because you felt obligated, or declaring a resolution out of peer pressure, may mean your heart really isn’t in it. And you likely won’t take action when you aren’t committed to your goal. Mental health issues. A lack of motivation is a common symptom of depression. It can also be linked to other mental illnesses, like anxiety. So it’s important to consider whether your mental health may be affecting your motivation level. Listen to music while you run. Call a friend, and talk while you’re cleaning the house. Light a scented candle while you’re working on your computer. Rent a luxury vehicle when you travel for business. Invite a friend to run errands with you. Turn on your favorite show while you’re folding laundry. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. Drink water, and eat a healthy diet. Make time for leisure and fun. Use healthy coping skills to deal with stress. Avoid unhealthy habits, like binge eating and drinking too much alcohol. Write 500 words, and then take a 10-minute break. Eat one piece of chocolate after 30 minutes of work. Write one page a day, and then remind yourself that when you’re done, you’ll have free time to do whatever you want. Work for 20 minutes, and then spend 5 minutes checking social media. When you complete the paper, allow yourself to go out with friends.",whether get motivate clean house feel motivate lose weight lack motivation biggest obstacle reach goals motivation complete task

Some people just seem to have a knack for making conversation while others struggle to make small talk. Knowing how to start a conversation is a useful social skill. Whether you want to impress a potential client, strike up a conversation with a love interest, or just chat with a new acquaintance, knowing how to initiate a conversation can help you feel more comfortable and confident in a wide variety of social situations.
 
If a room full of strangers is your idea of a waking nightmare, the idea of going to a party or work event can be incredibly daunting. These sorts of social situations can be especially difficult if you tend to be introverted, shy, or socially anxious.
 
One way to ease anxiety is to prepare in advance. Mentally review what you want to talk about and even consider practicing with a friend. The first step toward becoming an amazing conversationalist it to be prepared.
 
If you are nervous about starting a conversation, try these three simple strategies before you begin:
 
While it should go without saying, there are a few things you should avoid unless you are very familiar with the person with whom you are speaking.
 
While political commentary, gossip, complaints, and offensive jokes might be how your uncle starts conversations during your family get-togethers, it is probably not an example you should try to emulate in your day-to-day life.
 Anything offensive, controversial, or uncomfortable should be avoided as you are initiating conversations. 
There is a time and place to express your opinion or even try to persuade others, but make sure that such topics are welcome before you launch into an impassioned debate.
 
Some research suggests that when it comes to conversation openers, your best bet may be to stick to comments that are fairly innocuous. In one study, participants were asked to rate the effectiveness of a number of opening lines that might come from a potential romantic partner: flippant ""pick-up"" lines, open-ended, innocuous questions, and the direct approach.
 
Few respondents appreciated the pick-up line approach, but responses tended to be split when it came to preferences for the other two opening styles. Women tended to prefer the innocuous questions (""What's your favorite team?"") while men favored the more direct approach (""I'd like to buy you a drink!"").
 
The authors of the study suggest that it is best to err on the side of the innocuous approach when choosing a way to initiate a conversation with a stranger. This type of conversation opener tends to be less threatening, yet encourages the other person to provide some type of response.
 
Try to start your conversation on an upbeat note. Stay away from launching into complaints or making negative observations. No matter what the situation is, you can find something positive to say.
 
Comment on the weather, the food, the company, or the event itself. Saying something as simple as you are having a good time and hoping that your conversation partner is having a pleasant experience as well is a good way to get a conversation rolling. Even if the situation itself is not perfect, try to put a positive spin on it.
 
People tend to respond better to a positive comment rather than a negative one. It helps show that you are a pleasant person who pays attention to what’s going on. Staying positive also helps put others at ease. As a result, people will be more interested in continuing a conversation with you.
 
Not every great conversation needs to begin with a deep, philosophical, earth-shattering observation. Simple icebreaker comments or questions are a great way to begin.
 
Commenting on the weather, the room, or the food might seem cliche, but there is a reason why this sort of icebreaker works so well. It’s a simple, easy way to get a conversation rolling, offering a bit of common ground between two strangers. Talking about inconsequential things can lead to further conversations about personal preferences, backgrounds, hobbies, and deeper topics that can help forge social bonds between people.
 
In one study published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers performed naturalistic observations on participants to record both small talk and deep conversations over a period of several days.
 
What they found is that people who engaged in deeper, personal conversations also had higher levels of happiness. This might mean that happy people are more likely to engage others in meaningful conversations—but it also might mean that such substantive conversations may actually lead to greater happiness. The researchers suggest that “the findings demonstrate that the happy life is social rather than solitary and conversationally deep rather than superficial.”
 
Not everyone loves making small talk, but it can be an important first step that can lead to deeper, more meaningful conversations.
 While starting a conversation often begins by focusing on small, trivial things, research suggests that having more deep conversations may be linked to greater happiness and well-being. 
Learning how to start a conversation can help lead you into these more consequential social connections.
 
Asking a question is a great way to start a conversation. Doing this not only gives you a reason to engage the other person—but it also gives them a chance to be helpful.
 
When using this approach, start with something simple that can be accomplished without a great deal of effort. For example, you might ask someone if they know what time a workshop begins or directions to a particular location.
 
One of the benefits of this approach is that asking a simple question can lead to further conversation about other topics. Once you have posed your question and the other person has offered their assistance, it creates something of a reciprocal social contract between you and your conversation partner.
 
Since they have offered their assistance, it is now up to you to give your thanks and introduce yourself. This can serve as an opportunity for you to ask more about the other person—who they are, what brings them here, and other questions that are relevant given the setting and situation.
 
Sometimes what you don’t say is just as important as what you do say. As you strike up a new conversation, it is important to pay attention to your nonverbal communication.
 
Body language can be used to convey interest and emotion. A friendly expression, comfortable stance, and good eye contact, for example, can help show that you have a genuine interest in learning more about another person. Slouching, looking away, and frowning, on the other hand, might make your conversation partner feel that you are bored or disinterested.
 
Encouraging nonverbal signals include:
 
It can be intimidating to try to talk to someone when it feels that you have little in common. In these situations, getting the other person to talk about his or her own interests, work, or expertise can be a useful way to start a conversation.
 
Ask a question about what the other person does, then focus on really listening to what they have to say. People often enjoy talking about things they are passionate about, so expressing a genuine interest in the things that other people enjoy can be excellent fuel for a great conversation.
 
A good conversation does not rely on just one approach.
 The best discussions involve a mixture of asking questions, listening to what other people have to say, and sharing things about yourself. 
A simple conversation might start by:
 
Learning how to start a conversation is an important skill that can help you build social connections in a wide variety of contexts. It can be difficult initially, particularly if you struggle with shyness or social anxiety, but gaining plenty of practice is the key to become more comfortable talking to other people.
 
Try to think of every one of these interactions as a practice session. The more often you initiate discussions with others, the stronger your conversational skills will become.
 
Forging strong social connections is critical for both physical and mental health. Research has found that forming social relationships is linked to a stronger immune system, increased longevity, lower anxiety levels, greater empathy for others, and better self-esteem. By learning how to start a conversation, you will be better able to forge the social connections that are so critical to health and well-being.
 Stay Positive: Stop worrying about making a mistake and have faith in your abilities. Worrying too much about what you are going to say next can actually cause you to lose track of the conversation as it’s happening. Instead, try to stay focused on the other person and what they are saying. Take a Deep Breath: If you are tense and nervous, you're less likely to feel at ease. Try to stay relaxed and just let the conversation flow naturally. Introduce Yourself: One of the simplest ways to begin is to just introduce yourself and then give the other person the chance to do the same. Once this initial icebreaker has taken place, try asking a simple question or making a simple observation to help inspire further discussion. “That was a really great presentation, wasn’t it?” “Whoever organized this event sure did a great job!” “Your presentation was excellent. I feel like I really learned a lot!” “It’s quite cold today but the weather report said that tomorrow is supposed to be nice and sunny.” “Do you happen to know where I could get a schedule?” “Have you seen an earring? I seem to have lost one.” “Do you know if there will be refreshments served after the workshop?” An open posture, which involves keeping the trunk of your body open with your arms relaxed, helps convey a sense of friendliness. Good eye contact involves looking at a person’s eyes. Don’t stare, which can be threatening. Instead, keep things natural, looking at the other person’s eyes but glancing away occasionally. Smiling can be helpful, as long as it seems genuine and natural. Avoid faking a big smile and try to go for a relaxed but uplifting expression. Asking some basic information (“Did you enjoy the presentation?”) Listening to the answer (“It was great! I feel like I really learned a lot!”) Disclosing your own thoughts (“I thought so as well. I already have some ideas about how I can incorporate those tips into my work process.”) Next, you might repeat the process by asking another question, or your conversation partner might then choose to ask a question about your earlier response.)",people seem knack make conversation others struggle make small talk know start conversation useful social skill whether want impress potential client

"
Emotional intelligence, sometimes referred to as EQ (""emotional quotient""), refers to a person's ability to recognize, understand, manage, and reason with emotions. It is a critical ability when it comes to interpersonal communication—and a hot topic not only in psychology, but in the business world.
 
The term was coined by psychologists in the 1990s. Its use quickly spread into other areas including business, education, and popular culture.
 
Psychologists Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer, two of the leading researchers on the topic, define emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others. This ability also involves using this emotional understanding to make decisions, solve problems, and communicate with others.
 
According to Salovey and Mayer, there are four different levels of emotional intelligence:
 
In the past, emotions and intelligence were often viewed as being in opposition to one another. In recent decades, however, researchers exploring emotion psychology have become increasingly interested in cognition and affect.
 
This area explores how cognitive processes and emotions interact and influence the ways that people think. Consider how emotions and moods such as happiness, anger, fear, and sadness influence how people behave and make decisions.
 
Interest in emotion psychology and the concept of emotional intelligence really caught fire with the 1995 publication of Daniel Goleman's book ""Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ."" In the book, Goleman argued that emotional intelligence was critical for predicting success in life. Emotional competencies, he argued, also played a particularly important role in the workplace.
 
The concept quickly attracted the attention of the public, including human resource managers and business leaders. Researchers have suggested that emotional intelligence influences how well employees interact with their colleagues, and EQ is also thought to play a role in how workers manage stress and conflict. It also affects overall performance on the job. Other studies have linked emotional intelligence with job satisfaction.
 Studies have shown that employees with higher scores on measures of EQ also tend to be rated higher on measures of interpersonal functioning, leadership abilities, and stress management. 
Goleman suggested that while traditional intelligence was associated with leadership success, it alone was not enough. People who are successful at work aren't just smart—they also have a high EQ.
 
But emotional intelligence is not just for CEOs and senior managers. It's a quality that's important at every level of a person's career, from college students looking for internships to seasoned employees hoping to take on a leadership role. If you want to succeed in the workplace and move up the career ladder, emotional intelligence is critical to your success.
 
Why is emotional intelligence such a valued workplace skill? According to one survey of hiring managers, almost 75% of respondents suggested that they valued an employee's EQ more than their IQ.
 
Emotional intelligence is widely recognized as a valuable skill that helps improve communication, management, problem-solving, and relationships within the workplace. It is also a skill that researchers believe can be improved with training and practice.
 Make better decisions and solve problems Keep cool under pressure Resolve conflicts Have greater empathy Listen, reflect, and respond to constructive criticism Play the role of the victim or avoid taking responsibility for errors Have passive or aggressive communication styles Refuse to work as a team   Are overly critical of others or dismiss others' opinions 
While emotional skills may come naturally to some people, there are things that anyone can do to help improve their ability to understand and reason with emotions. This can be particularly helpful in the workplace, where relationships and business decisions often rely on the interpersonal understanding, teamwork, and communication.
 Factors such as upbringing and personality tend to play a large role in the development of emotional intelligence, but it is a skill that can be improved with effort and practice. 
One 2011 study found that participants who trained in key emotional competencies showed lasting improvements in emotional intelligence. They also experienced improvements in physical and mental well-being, better social relationships, and lower cortisol (stress hormone) levels.﻿﻿
 
If you are interested in improving your emotional intelligence skills to benefit your workplace performance, take steps to improve your skills in the five categories of emotional intelligence: Self-awareness, self-regulation, social skills, empathy, and motivation.
 
One of the first steps toward utilizing emotional intelligence skills in the workplace is to practice recognizing your own emotions. Self-awareness involves being aware of different aspects of yourself, including your emotions and feelings. It is one of the foundational components of emotional intelligence. In order to recognize your emotions and understand what is causing these feelings, you need to first be self-aware.
 
Goleman identified self-regulation as a critical part of emotional intelligence. Being aware of your emotions is an important first step, but you also need to be able to manage your feelings.
 People who possess good self-regulation are able to adapt well to changing situations. They don't bottle things up; they wait for appropriate ways to express their emotions rather than reacting impulsively. 
To improve your self-regulation skills in the workplace:
 
Research on emotion psychology suggests that people with high EQs also have strong social skills. Because they are adept at recognizing other people's emotions, they are able to respond appropriately to the situation. Social skills are also highly valued in the workplace because they lead to better communication and a more positive company culture.
 
Employees and leaders with great social skills are able to build rapport with colleagues and communicate their ideas effectively. People with good social skills are not only great team players, but they are also able to take on leadership roles when needed. To boost your social skills:
 
Emotionally intelligent people are good at stepping into another person's shoes and understanding how they feel. Empathy is more than just recognizing how others are feeling. It also involves how you respond to these emotions.
 
In the workplace, empathy allows you to understand the different dynamics between colleagues and supervisors. It also allows you to recognize who holds power and how it influences the behaviors, feelings, and interactions that flow from such relationships.
 
Another key component of emotional intelligence is intrinsic motivation. People who have strong EQ tend to be more motivated to achieve goals for their own sake. Rather than seeking external rewards, they want to do things because they find them fulfilling and they are passionate about what they do.
 
Money, status, and acclaim are great, but people who are highly successful in the workplace are usually motivated by something more than that. They are passionate about what they do. They have a commitment to their work, they love taking on new challenges, and their enthusiasm can seem contagious. They don't give up in the face of obstacles and they are able to inspire others to work hard and persist in order to achieve goals.
 
Emotional intelligence plays an important role not only in well-being but also in your success in the workplace. Fortunately, there are a number of lessons you can take from emotion psychology that will allow you to improve your EQ and foster greater emotional competencies to improve your work performance and career success.
 Perceiving emotions Reasoning with emotions Understanding emotions Managing emotions Make better decisions and solve problems Keep cool under pressure Resolve conflicts Have greater empathy Listen, reflect, and respond to constructive criticism Play the role of the victim or avoid taking responsibility for errors Have passive or aggressive communication styles Refuse to work as a team   Are overly critical of others or dismiss others' opinions Pay attention to how you are feeling. How do these emotions influence how you respond? Do the things you are feeling have an impact on the decisions you make or how you interact with others? As you reflect on these questions, you may find that you become much more aware of your own emotions and the role that they play in your daily life. Take stock of emotional strengths and weaknesses. How well do you communicate with others? Do you find yourself experiencing impatience, anger, or annoyance often? What are some ways you can deal with these feelings effectively? Recognizing weaknesses allows you to look for ways to deal with them. Remember that emotions are fleeting. A co-worker might irritate you or your boss might give you a frustrating task to complete. Before you react, remember that these things are temporary. Making rash decisions based on intense emotions can be detrimental to your long-term goals and success. Find techniques to release workplace stress. Having hobbies outside of work is a great place to start. Physical exercise is also a healthy way to release stress. Keep your cool. Accept the fact that you cannot control everything. Look for helpful ways to respond that don't add fuel to the fire. Think before making decisions. Emotions can overwhelm you in the heat of the moment. You can make a calmer, more rational choice if you give yourself time to consider all of the possibilities. Listen to what others have to say. This doesn't mean just passively listening to other people talk. Active listening involves showing attention, asking questions, and providing feedback. Whether you are a manager or a team member, active listening can show that you are passionate about work projects and willing to work with others to help the group reach its goals. Pay attention to nonverbal communication. The signals that people send through their body language can convey a lot about what they really think. Hone your persuasion skills. Being able to carry influence in the workplace and convince team members and supervisors to listen to your ideas can go a long way in advancing your career. Avoid office drama. Do your best to stay out of the petty office politics that sometimes take over the workplace, but be aware that conflicts are not always avoidable. Focus on listening to what others have to say and look for ways to solve problems and minimize tensions. See things from the other person's point of view. It can be challenging at times, especially if you feel like the other person is wrong. But rather than let disagreements build up into major conflicts, spend time looking at the situation from another's perspective. It can be a great first step toward finding a middle ground between two opposing points of view. Pay attention to how you respond to others. Do you let them have a chance to share their ideas? Do you acknowledge their input, even if you disagree? Letting others know that their efforts have merit often helps everyone feel more willing to compromise. Focus on what you love about your work. There are probably things about your job that you love and things that you hate.Try focusing on the aspects of your job that you enjoy, such as the feeling of accomplishment you get when you complete a big project, or helping your clients progress toward their own goals. Identify those components of your job and take inspiration from them. Try to maintain a positive attitude. Notice how optimistic people in the workplace tend to inspire and motivate others. Adopting this kind of attitude can help you feel more positively about your work.",emotional intelligence sometimes refer emotional quotient refer person ability recognize understand manage reason

Individuals with social intelligence can sense how other people feel, know intuitively what to say in social situations, and seem self-assured, even in a larger crowd. You might think of these folk as having “people skills,” but what they truly possess is social intelligence.
 
The theory of social intelligence was first brought to the forefront by American psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1920.﻿﻿ He defined it as, “The ability to understand and manage men and women and boys and girls, to act wisely in human relations.” No one is born socially intelligent. Instead, it involves a set of skills that an individual learns over time.
 
People who are socially intelligent display core traits that help them communicate and connect with others.
 
While some people may seem to develop social intelligence without really trying, others have to work to develop it. Luckily, certain strategies can help a person build social skills. These tactics can help you develop social intelligence:
 
Social intelligence isn’t easy to master—if it were, there wouldn’t ever be another awkward conversation at a party. However, working toward a strong social intelligence can lead to a richer life—or, at least, an easier time making a few new friends.
 
Study social situations. Pay attention to what people are doing well and the mistakes you want to avoid. Afterward, think about what you want to do differently in the next social situation you enter.
 
Get proactive about improving your skills. And remember, that you're going to mess up sometimes. Learn from your failures as well as your successes.
 Effective Listening: A person who possesses social intelligence doesn’t listen merely to respond but truly pays attention to what a person is saying. The other folks in the conversation walk away feeling like they were understood and that they made a connection. Conversational Skills: Have you ever seen someone “work the room?” They have conversational skills that enable them to carry on a discussion with practically anybody. They’re tactful, appropriate, humorous and sincere in these conversations, and they remember details about people that allow the dialogue to be more meaningful.﻿﻿ Reputation Management: Socially intelligent people consider the impression that they make on other people. Considered one of the most complex elements of social intelligence, managing a reputation requires careful balance—a person must thoughtfully create an impression on another person while still being authentic. Lack of Arguing: Someone with social intelligence understands that arguing or proving a point by making another person feel bad isn’t the way to go. They don’t outright reject another person’s ideas, but rather listen to them with an open mind—even when it’s not an idea that they personally agree with. Pay close attention to what (and who) is around you. Socially intelligent people are observant and pay attention to subtle social cues from those around them.﻿﻿ If you think that someone in your life has strong people skills, watch how they interact with others. Work on increasing your emotional intelligence. Although similar to social intelligence, emotional intelligence is more about how you control your own emotions and how you empathize with others. It requires recognizing when you’re experiencing an emotion—which will help you recognize that emotion in others—and regulating them appropriately. An emotionally intelligent person can recognize and control negative feelings, such as frustration or anger, when in a social setting.﻿﻿ Respect cultural differences. More than that, seek out cultural differences so you can understand them. Although most people learn people skills from their family, friends and the community surrounding them, a socially intelligent person understands that others might have different responses and customs based on their upbringing. Practice active listening.  Develop your social intelligence by working on your communication skills—which requires active listening.﻿﻿ Don’t interrupt. Take time to think about what someone else is saying before you respond. Listen to the inflections in what others say, which can give you clues to what they really mean. Appreciate the important people in your life. Socially intelligent people have deep relationships with people who are meaningful to them. Pay attention to the emotions of your spouse and children, friends, co-workers, and other peers. If you ignore the closest people in your life, you’re missing the cues on how to connect with them.",individuals social intelligence sense people feel know intuitively say social situations seem self assure even larger crowd might think folk people skills truly possess social intelligence theory social intelligence first bring forefront american psychologist edward thorndike define ability understand manage men women boys girls act wisely human relations one bear socially intelligent instead involve set skills individual learn time people socially intelligent display core traits help communicate connect others people may seem develop social intelligence without really try others work develop luckily certain strategies help person build social skills tactics help develop social intelligence social intelligence easy master ever another awkward conversation party however work toward strong social intelligence lead richer life least easier time make new friends study social situations pay attention people well mistake want avoid afterward think want differently next social situation enter get proactive improve skills remember mess sometimes learn failures well successes effective listen person possess social intelligence listen merely respond truly pay attention person say folks conversation walk away feel like understand make connection conversational skills ever see someone work room conversational skills enable carry discussion practically anybody tactful appropriate humorous sincere conversations remember detail people allow dialogue meaningful reputation management socially intelligent people consider impression make people consider one complex elements social intelligence manage reputation require careful balance person must thoughtfully create impression another person still authentic lack argue someone social intelligence understand argue prove point make another person feel bad way outright reject another person ideas rather listen open mind even idea personally agree pay close attention around socially intelligent people observant pay attention subtle social cue around think someone life strong people skills watch interact others work increase emotional intelligence although similar social intelligence emotional intelligence control emotions empathize others require recognize experience emotion help recognize emotion others regulate appropriately emotionally intelligent person recognize control negative feel frustration anger social set respect cultural differences seek cultural differences understand although people learn people skills family friends community surround socially intelligent person understand others might different responses customs base upbringing practice active listen develop social intelligence work communication skills require active listen interrupt take time think someone else say respond listen inflections others say give clue really mean appreciate important people life socially intelligent people deep relationships people meaningful pay attention emotions spouse children friends workers peer ignore closest people life miss cue connect

Expertise is what separates the amateur from the true master in almost any field, from medicine to science to sports to artistic performance. The idea of whether experts are ""born"" or ""made"" relates to the age-old nature versus nurture debate in psychology—do genetics or experience play more of a role in shaping who we are? In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of attention paid to the ""made"" aspect of the debate. Expertise is acquired through dedicated practice, many experts in the field suggest.
 
But how exactly do people go about becoming experts? Are some people simply born with the requisite talent, or can anyone become an expert with the proper study and training?
 
While it might be easy to point out who is and is not an expert, agreeing on a formal definition of expertise is not always so easy. Is it about how much you know? Is it about being able to perform an action well? And at what point does a person move from being merely good at something to being a bona fide expert?
 
""Expertise is consensually defined as elite, peak, or exceptionally high levels of performance on a particular task or within a given domain,"" explained researcher Lyle E. Bourne, Jr. of the University of Colorado, Boulder and his colleagues in an article published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. ""One who achieves this status is called an expert or some related term, such as virtuoso, master, maven, prodigy, or genius. These terms are meant to label someone whose performance is at the top of the game. An expert's field of expertise can be almost anything from craftsmanship, through sports and music, to science or mathematics.""
 
So why do we so often label expertise with different terms? Each word tends to have its own subtle nuance that conveys what type of expert a person might be. If their expertise is perceived as being the result of hard work and practice, we might describe them as a master or a virtuoso. If people see their abilities as arising from pure inborn talent, they might be referred to as a genius or a prodigy.
 
Some of the critical components of expertise are knowledge, skill, and achievement. People who become experts tend to acquire a body of knowledge that makes them one of the most informed individuals in their field. They also possess the skills that they need to determine when and how to utilize their knowledge. Such skills are often learned, but they can also be influenced by natural talent and ability. Finally, people who possess expertise also tend to excel in their field and achieve far above and beyond what the average person does.
 
Recently, a popular idea has emerged that the key to becoming an expert was devoting at least 10,000 hours to the study and practice of a subject. In a 1993 study, researchers found that the most accomplished violinists at a music academy had spent an average of 10,000 hours practicing their instrument by the age of 20. Pop psychology author Malcolm Gladwell coined the phrase ""the ten-thousand-hour rule"" in his best-selling 2008 book Outliers.
 
Gladwell pointed to the results of the music study as well as observations that musical greats The Beatles had likely spent around 10,000 hours practicing playing music during the early 1960s. Gladwell also suggested that tech-entrepreneur Bill Gates had devoted 10,000 hours to practicing programming before he created Microsoft. According to Gladwell, a person could become an expert in nearly any field as long as they were willing to devote the requisite 10,000 hours to studying and practicing the subject or skill.
 
The idea has become enormously popular outside of academics, but just how true are the claims? Can spending 10,000 hours on a subject really guarantee that you will become an expert?
 
Anders Ericsson of the University of Florida is a world-renowned expert on peak performance and author of Peak: The New Science of Expertise. He has studied experts from all walks of life including areas such as chess, sports, music, and medicine. He is also the researcher behind the study from which Gladwell drew his conclusions about what it takes to become an expert.
 
Ericcson points out a few key problems with the ""ten-thousand-hour rule"":
 
Ericsson believes that what separates the amateur from the expert is what is referred to as deliberate practice. Ordinary practice can help people become skilled at a task, but gaining true expertise involves practicing in a way that pushes the boundaries of current skill levels and knowledge. Such practice is highly concentrated and involves working on things that are outside of your current skill-level, setting goals, and receiving training and instruction from a qualified teacher.
 Just putting in 10,000 hours rehearsing the same things over and over again is not enough to become a true expert. Instead, concentrated, goal-directed, deliberate practice that stretches your abilities beyond your comfort zone is what you should pursue if you want to gain expertise in any area. 
While Ericsson believes that deliberate practice is the key to becoming an expert, not all researchers agree with his conclusions. Some recent studies have found that while the deliberate practice is certainly important, it is not the only factor that explains the differences between the skilled and the unskilled. While psychologists are not yet sure exactly which factors might also play a role, personality traits, physical characteristics, and overall intelligence may matter as well.
 
So can you really become an expert in anything as long as you are willing to devote the time and effort to it? It's a question that psychologists continue to ponder, although there is little doubt that practicing regularly will lead to an improvement in both skills and knowledge. Whether you might eventually be able to become a true master in that specific domain is something that may only be known once you try. Before you decide to pursue it, consider whether you have the interest, dedication, and time to commit to gaining expertise in that domain.
 
So what does it really take to gain true expertise? What steps do you need to follow in order to become an expert?
 
While the 10,000-hour rule is more pop-psych myth than reality, there is one aspect of the idea that is accurate—becoming an expert takes a great deal of effort. People who become experts in any field devote a tremendous amount of time, energy, and hard work toward learning and practicing their skill. If you want to master something, you need to be willing to put in the time. It might not take exactly 10,000 hours, but it will take a lot.
 
One study found that out of three different types of study preparation, the deliberate practice was the most effective. Researchers looked at participants in the National Spelling Bee and compared study methods with performance. Deliberate practice, defined as studying and memorizing words alone, was more effective than reading for pleasure and being quizzed by others as a study method.
 
Interestingly, the deliberate practice was also rated as the least enjoyable and most difficult study technique. Participants who persisted with the technique also possessed higher levels of the personality trait called grit, also known as mental toughness. The researchers suggest that this mental toughness may sometimes be an important part of being able to stick with deliberate practice. While it was less intrinsically rewarding, those with grit were able to persevere and keep their eyes on their long-term goals, making them more likely to stick with the deliberate practice and more likely to perform better during competition.
 
One recent study, however, found that deliberate practice may actually be less important than previously believed. Researchers Brooke Macnamara, David Z. Hambrick and Frederick Oswald found that the amount of accumulated practice did not play a major role in explaining individual differences when it came to performance or skill.
 
In a meta-analysis of previous studies, the researchers found that practice accounted for just 12 percent of the individual differences found in performance.
 
However, a practice still mattered. On almost all of the studies included in the analysis, there was a positive relationship between practice and performance. The more people practiced, the better they performed in their area of interest.
 
What the researchers found was that the domain itself also mattered. When it came to education, practice only accounted for four percent of differences in individual performance. This number jumped up to 18 percent for sports, 21 percent for music, and 26 percent for games. In other words, practice played a greater role in improving performance for activities such as music, athletics, and games, and less of a role for professional or educational performance.
 
So what else might be important in the development of expertise?
 
Practice is essential for developing a skill, but becoming an expert requires constantly challenging yourself to do better, learn more, and acquire new knowledge and skills. Simply rehearsing the same skills over and over again will make you better in those areas, but it won't lead to true expertise.
 
The seminal educational psychologist Lev Vygotsky proposed an important learning concept known as the zone of proximal development. This zone included the skills that were just outside of a person's current ability level. While a person might not yet be able to do these things on their own, they can achieve them with the assistance of a more skilled mentor. By continually reaching for these new skills, mastering them, and then progressively expanding this zone of proximal development, people are able to learn and develop their abilities.
 
Becoming an expert requires constantly working within this zone of proximal development. Even once you have become very good at a skill within a particular domain, this does not mean that even greater expertise is out of reach. More learning, more knowledge, and better performance are still possible with further challenge and practice.
 
While we often think that it's intelligence that separates the experts from the rest of us, research suggests that true expertise has more to do with acquired knowledge than inborn mental abilities. Some people might be born with natural resources including physical abilities and access to the tools they need that allow them to achieve this expertise more readily. But becoming an expert takes effort and practice, no matter what your natural ability levels are at the start.
 
And even the experts are not always perfect. Experts do make mistakes, but they're also ready to catch their own errors and eager to learn from them. Mistakes are a form of feedback. They tell us not only what not to do, but also provide information on what we might try instead. Experts are able to spot these mistakes, correct course, and apply this knowledge in the future.
 
Researchers continue to debate exactly what it takes to become an expert. There is no doubt, however, that it requires time, practice, and dedication.
 First, while the students in the music study were very good violinists by age 20, they were not masters. In other words, they were excellent players, but that did not necessarily mean they were masters of their craft. Ericsson suggests that it is sometimes around the 20,000- to 25,000-hour mark that people truly become experts or masters of a skill or subject. Secondly, not all skills are the same. Some skills require far fewer than 10,000 hours to reach the expert level, while others require much more. Ericsson also points out that Gladwell's interpretation of his research is flawed. While Gladwell assumed that all of the violinists in the music study had put in the 10,000 hours of practice, that number was really only an average. Half of the violists studied by Ericsson and his colleagues spent less than 10,000 hours practicing their instruments by the age of 20, while half spent more.",expertise separate amateur true master

Month-long jump-start challenges often promise a fool-proof path to a new life with healthy new habits in 30 days. Challenges can be connected to any number of health behaviors, productivity habits, or other simple changes that can lead to a better life. But do they work? 
 
The answer is yes and no. The challenge in and of itself may not yield the promised results, such as six-pack abs, but the act of practicing a new behavior daily can help you develop better habits.
 
A habit is a learned automatic response. Forming new healthy habits—or breaking bad ones—involves multiple steps including making a decision to change, initiating the new behavior, and repeating it often.
 
Building new healthy habits takes time. A 30-day challenge can help to get the ball rolling, but it may not be enough to make lasting change. In fact, research suggests it takes an average of 66 days for a new behavior to become ingrained. 
 A 2010 study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology found the length of time it takes for a new behavior to become automatic varies from 18 days to 254 days.﻿﻿ According to the authors, missing one day did not hinder progress, however, the more difficult the behavioral change was perceived, the longer it took for the habit to form.  
Change is made in small steps or stages. The ""pre-contemplation stage"" occurs before you even think actively about making changes. The next stage involves thinking and planning but no actual observable change as far as taking on the new habit is concerned.
 
It's only in the next stage that the actual new habit is acquired. Interestingly, if the habit is dropped, this isn't considered a failure, but rather a predictable part of the whole process of change and even a specific stage of change if you don't give up trying; it's considered a part of the process of creating lasting change.
 
While perseverance is essential for making any new habit stick, researchers have identified several other tools that can help. 
 
Context and consistency are strongly linked to success in modifying behaviors. According to research published in the British Journal of Health Psychology in 2013, tying a new habit to a current routine can be useful.﻿﻿
 
The study focused on teeth flossing and found those who flossed after brushing their teeth developed more consistent flossing habits than those who planned to floss first, then brush their teeth. 
 According to the study authors, creating sub-routines in the middle of an existing routine can have a greater likelihood of habit formation.﻿﻿ In addition, positive attitudes had a direct result on successfully making a new habit.  
Ways to implement this strategy include: 
 
One way that 30-day challenges on social media can help create new habits is the support people get when posting online. Using apps, such as MyFitnessPal, FitBit, Habitify, or Todoist, can also boost success.
 A 2018 study published in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics found interactive digital support systems can help people establish healthier lifestyle habits.﻿﻿ 
In the study, patients who were at risk of metabolic syndrome were able to lose 5-percent of their body weight and stave off health issues by using software that provided motivation and reminders to monitor diet and fitness activity. 
 
The researchers suspect the digital interactions helped to reduce the mental load of forming a new habit and enabled greater consistency so the task becomes automatic.﻿﻿
 
Whatever habit you'd like to make—diet, exercise, skincare, meditation, gratitude, etc.—you are likely to find a 30-day challenge for it.
 
There are two basic types of 30-day challenges: ones that introduce and strengthen new habits over the month and ones that offer something unique to try each day. Both can be effective ways to start a new healthy habit.
 
Here are some challenges we recommend:
 
Given that it takes an average of 66 days to make a new habit, doing a 30-day challenge isn’t a guarantee that a new behavior will become part of your life.
 
Committing to a 30-day challenge has three main benefits:
 Taking a challenge along with supportive friends—in real life or virtually—adds an additional level of support. Some people find online challenges offer an aspect of friendly competition that helps propel them forward. 
Before committing to a challenge, make sure it's in line with your goals and realistic for your lifestyle.
 
For example, a money-saving challenge that has you socking away more money than you make by the end of the month isn't practical. Likewise, don't begin a workout challenge that requires levels of exercise that exceed what is safe or healthy for your situation. 
 
For some people, 30-day challenges promote an all or nothing mentality that can set them up for failure. It's important to remember, if you miss a day or stray from the challenge, you can start right back up again where you left off, or recommit to starting on Day 1 for a fresh start.
 
Using a 30-day challenge can be an effective strategy for building new habits. Choose your challenge carefully to ensure it aligns with your goals and set realistic expectations for what you hope to accomplish.
 
Not all online challenges are designed with the right intentions. Oftentimes social media influences will use challenges as a way to boost engagement for greater ad revenue, as a means to sell their products, or simply as a way to toot their own horn.

Problem-solving is a mental process that involves discovering, analyzing, and solving problems. The ultimate goal of problem-solving is to overcome obstacles and find a solution that best resolves the issue.
 
The best strategy for solving a problem depends largely on the unique situation. In some cases, people are better off learning everything they can about the issue and then using factual knowledge to come up with a solution. In other instances, creativity and insight are the best options.
 
In order to correctly solve a problem, it is often important to follow a series of steps. Many researchers refer to this as the problem-solving cycle.﻿﻿ While this cycle is portrayed sequentially, people rarely follow a rigid series of steps to find a solution.
 It is not necessary to follow problem-solving steps sequentially, It is common to skip steps or even go back through steps multiple times until the desired solution is reached. 
The following steps include developing strategies and organizing knowledge.
 
It is important to remember that there are many different problem-solving processes with different steps and this is just one example. Problem-solving in real-world situations requires a great deal of resourcefulness, flexibility, resilience, and continuous interaction with the environment.﻿﻿
 Identifying the Problem: While it may seem like an obvious step, identifying the problem is not always as simple as it sounds. In some cases, people might mistakenly identify the wrong source of a problem, which will make attempts to solve it inefficient or even useless. Defining the Problem: After the problem has been identified, it is important to fully define the problem so that it can be solved. Forming a Strategy: The next step is to develop a strategy to solve the problem. The approach used will vary depending upon the situation and the individual's unique preferences. Organizing Information: Before coming up with a solution, we need to first organize the available information. What do we know about the problem? What do we not know? The more information that is available, the better prepared we will be to come up with an accurate solution. Allocating Resources: Of course, we don't always have unlimited money, time, and other resources to solve a problem. Before you begin to solve a problem, you need to determine how high priority it is. If it is an important problem, it is probably worth allocating more resources to solving it. If, however, it is a fairly unimportant problem, then you do not want to spend too much of your available resources into coming up with a solution. Monitoring Progress: Effective problem-solvers tend to monitor their progress as they work towards a solution. If they are not making good progress toward reaching their goal, they will reevaluate their approach or look for new strategies. Evaluating the Results: After a solution has been reached, it is important to evaluate the results to determine if it is the best possible solution to the problem. This evaluation might be immediate, such as checking the results of a math problem to ensure the answer is correct, or it can be delayed, such as evaluating the success of a therapy program after several months of treatment.​",problem solve mental process involve discover analyze solve problems ultimate goal problem solve overcome obstacles find solution best resolve issue best strategy solve problem depend largely unique situation case people better learn everything issue use factual knowledge come solution instance creativity insight best options order correctly solve problem often important follow series step many researchers refer problem solve cycle cycle portray sequentially people rarely follow rigid series step find solution necessary follow problem solve step sequentially common skip step even back step multiple time desire solution reach follow step include develop strategies organize knowledge important remember many different problem solve process different step one example problem solve real world situations require great deal resourcefulness flexibility resilience continuous interaction environment identify problem may seem like obvious step identify problem always simple sound case people might mistakenly identify wrong source problem make attempt solve inefficient even useless define problem problem identify important fully define problem solve form strategy next step develop strategy solve problem approach use vary depend upon situation individual unique preferences organize information come solution need first organize available information know problem know information available better prepare come accurate solution allocate resources course always unlimited money time resources solve problem begin solve problem need determine high priority important problem probably worth allocate resources solve however fairly unimportant problem want spend much available resources come solution monitor progress effective problem solvers tend monitor progress work towards solution make good progress toward reach goal reevaluate approach look new strategies evaluate result solution reach important evaluate result determine best possible solution problem evaluation might immediate check result math problem ensure answer correct delay evaluate success therapy program several months treatment

Functional fixedness is a type of cognitive bias that involves a tendency to see objects as only working in a particular way.﻿﻿ For example, you might view a thumbtack as something that can only be used to hold paper to a corkboard. But what other uses might the item have?
 
In many cases, functional fixedness can prevent people from seeing the full range of uses for an object. It can also impair our ability to think of novel solutions to problems.﻿﻿
 
Imagine that you need to drive a nail into a wall so you can hang a framed photo. Unable to find a hammer, you spend a significant amount of time searching your house to find the missing tool. A friend comes over and suggests using a metal wrench instead to pound the nail into the wall.
 
Why didn't you think of using the metal wrench? Psychologists suggest that something known as functional fixedness often prevents us from thinking of alternative solutions to problems and different uses for objects.
 
Here's one well-known example of functional fixedness at work:
 
You have two candles, numerous thumbtacks, and a box of matches. Using only these items, try to figure out how to mount the candles to a wall.
 
How would you accomplish this? Many people might immediately start trying to use the thumbtacks to affix the candles to the wall. Due to functional fixedness, you might think of only one way to directly use the thumbtacks. There is another solution, however. Using the matches, melt the bottom part of each candle and then use the hot wax to stick the candle to the matchbox. Once the candles are attached to the box, use the thumbtacks to stick the box to the wall.
 
Functional fixedness is just one type of mental obstacle that can make problem-solving more difficult.
 Functional fixedness isn't always a bad thing. In many cases, it can act as a mental shortcut allowing you to quickly and efficiently determine a practical use for an object. 
For example, imagine that someone has asked you to open a toolbox and find a tool that can be used to loosen a screw. It would take a tremendous amount of time if you had to analyze every item in the box to determine how effective it might be at performing the task. Instead, you are able to quickly grab a screwdriver, the most obvious item for loosening a screw.

What if there was a way to get more out of each day? While we all have the same 24 hours, how we use that time impacts what we can accomplish. Recent research suggests that one way to pack more into your day is to sync your biological clock to your daily schedule. By doing certain things at peak periods of activity and energy, you might be able to improve your productivity.
 
Your biological clock controls a great deal of how you function. This works much like a program, regulating the timing of many biological functions ranging from when you sleep to when you reproduce. Circadian rhythms manage daily cycles of sleeping and waking and contribute to your energy levels at various points during the day.
 
You might become particularly aware of your body's biological clock at times when your daily schedule is thrown off-kilter. Shift workers, for example, must constantly adjust their daily ebb and flow to the demands of their work schedule. Travelers may experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycles leading to feelings of jet lag.
 
You've probably noticed that there are certain times during the day when you feel more energized. At other times, you might feel drained. Research has shown, however, that your body clock is responsible for far more than just your sleep-wake cycle.
 Mental alertness, hunger, stress, mood, heart function, and even immunity are also influenced by the body's daily rhythms. By synchronizing your biological clock with your daily schedule, you can make the most of your day and feel more accomplished and motivated. 
Circadian rhythms affect your sleep-wake cycle, eating habits, body temperature, digestion, hormone levels, and other body functions. Because of this, your body's internal clock can play an important role in your overall health. Interruptions to your circadian rhythm may contribute to health conditions including diabetes, seasonal affective disorder, and sleep disorders.﻿﻿
 
Fortunately, understanding how these cycles influence your health can help you address potential problems and seek treatments that can help. For example, you can make lifestyle changes that can help get your circadian rhythm back on track. Your doctor can also help you address conditions that might be affected by your body's natural rhythms and come up with treatments that involve both medication and lifestyle adjustments. 
 
The reality is that the demands of daily life such as school, commuting, work, and social events can all throw the body's natural cycles out of whack. The way we organize our daily activities is sometimes in direct contrast to our body's own inclinations.
 
Altering your schedule might not always be easy, but there are clear benefits to doing so. In addition to making better use of your time, there are also potential health implications. Circadian rhythm disruptions have been linked to a range of negative health outcomes including depression and diabetes.﻿﻿
 
When is the best time to tackle certain tasks?
 
Your biological clock plays a major role in controlling your daily sleeping and waking cycle. Factors such as your schedule, bedtime routines, and even age can play a role as well.
 
The body's natural sleep cycle changes as we age. Knowing this might help you adapt your own schedule to best suit your sleep needs.
 Energy levels tend to dip in the early afternoon. This can be a great time to take a nap. Even if you are not able to take a quick power nap, a quick break from your work might be beneficial and improve task performance.﻿﻿ 
Could eating at the right time really be better for your health? Studies suggest that eating at certain times may have some health benefits.
 
Restricting your eating to a 12 to 15-hour window during the day can be helpful. Eating before bed can also have a negative impact on sleep, so its best to avoid eating late in the evening. At the very least, try timing your last meal so that it a minimum of three hours before you go to bed.
 
Adjusting your exercise schedule to match your biological clock may also help you get the most out of your workouts.
 Research suggests that regular exercise can help regulate your circadian rhythm and help improve your daily sleep schedule.﻿﻿ 
The evening might be the best time for yoga and other exercises that require flexibility. This is because this is when the body is at its most relaxed and least prone to injury.
 
You may also want to adjust your schedule to make of most of your mental powers.
 
If you are working on some sort of creative task, you might want to wait until you are feeling a bit fatigued. In a study examining how the time of day influences problem solving, researchers had participants solve analytical problems during times when they were either at their mental peak or at non-optimal times of tiredness.﻿﻿
 The researchers found that people tend to do their best creative thinking when they are tired. Because the mind is more inclined to wander when we are tired, it seems that it can lead people to think in more novel and innovative ways. 
Of course, not everyone's biological clock functions the same way. Some people tend to experience energy peaks earlier in the day, while others are more active during the later hours. Thanks to the demands of daily life, it may sometimes feel like your biological clock and schedule are at odds.
 
So what can you do if your daily schedule is out of sync with your biological clock? Early risers, for example, may burn up their best energy in the early morning hours and feel burned out by the time evening rolls around. Night owls, on the other hand, might sleep through what might be the most productive times of the day and find themselves staying up at times when they tend to be low energy.
 Here are some tips for establishing a more productive daily schedule: 
Paying attention to how your energy levels shift throughout the day can give you a better idea of when you might be at your best. If you tend to feel more mentally alert in the mornings, try to schedule cognitively demanding activities during that time. Changing your daily schedule to better match your daily rhythms can take some time, but it can ultimately lead to greater productivity and improved motivation.
 Young children tend to be early risers, where teens are more inclined to sleep in. As people approach later adulthood, the sleep cycle continues to shift back toward rising earlier in the morning. Teens might be better served getting longer periods of rest before tackling their day, where older adults might prefer to get up earlier and go to bed earlier. Eating at the right time might help control your weight. According to one study, when certain mice had their food restricted to particular times, they were protected from excessive weight gain and metabolic diseases.﻿﻿ Surprisingly, research has found that when you eat can even play a role in resetting your biological clock. This research also suggests that if you are trying to adjust to a new schedule (such as if you are traveling or doing shift work), altering your eating schedule can also help you reset your body clock to better match your new daily schedule.﻿﻿ You might get the most out of workouts that take place in mid- to late afternoon. People tend to perform their best and are the least prone to injury between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Try strength-training later in the day. Physical strength also tends to be at its highest point between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. You are probably at your sharpest in the morning. Studies suggest that cognitive abilities tend to peak during the late morning hours you might want to tackle those mentally taxing activities before lunch.﻿﻿ Experts also suggest that alertness and attention levels taper off following meals. This is why you might find yourself struggling to concentrate on those post-lunch work meetings. Concentration levels tend to dip between noon and 4 p.m., which might explain why so many people feel like they need some type of energy-boosting pick-me-up during those hours. Establish a sleep schedule: Set an alarm and go to bed at the same time each night. Wake up when your alarm goes off—no hitting that snooze button over and over again. Give it some time: Getting used to a new schedule may take a while, but stick with it until it starts to feel more natural. Pay attention to your energy levels: Try to arrange certain activities around your peak energy levels. Not everyone is the same, so your own energy levels may follow a slightly different schedule.",way get day hours use time impact accomplish recent research suggest one way pack day sync biological

You have to make decisions both large and small throughout every single day of your life. What do you want to have for breakfast? What time should you meet a friend for dinner? What college should you go to? How many children do you want to have?
 
When faced with some decisions, you might be tempted to just flip a coin and let chance determine your fate. In most cases, we follow a certain strategy or series of strategies in order to arrive at a decision. For many of the relatively minor decisions that we make each and every day, flipping a coin wouldn't be such a terrible approach. For some of the complex and important decisions, we are more likely to invest a lot of time, research, effort, and mental energy into coming to the right conclusion.
 
So how exactly does this process work? The following are some of the major decision-making strategies that you might use.
 
This approach involves hinging your decision solely on a single feature. For example, imagine that you are buying soap. Faced with a wide variety of options at your local superstore, you decide to base your decision on price and buy the cheapest type of soap available. In this case, you ignored other variables (such as scent, brand, reputation, and effectiveness) and focused on just a single feature.
 The single-feature approach can be effective in situations where the decision is relatively simple and you are pressed for time. However, it is generally not the best strategy when dealing with more complex decisions. 
This method involves taking into account all the important features of the possible choices and then systematically evaluating each option. This approach tends to be a better method when making more complex decisions.
 
For example, imagine that you are interested in buying a new camera. You create a list of important features that you want the camera to have, then you rate each possible option on a scale of -5 to +5. Cameras that have important advantages might get a +5 rating for that factor, while those that have major drawbacks might get a -5 rating for that factor. Once you have looked at each option, you can then tally up the results to determine which option has the highest rating.
 The additive feature model can be a great way to determine the best option for a variety of choices. As you can imagine, however, it can be quite time-consuming and is probably not the best decision-making strategy to use if you are pressed for time. 
The elimination by aspects model was first proposed by psychologist Amos Tversky in 1972. In this approach, you evaluate each option one characteristic at a time beginning with whatever feature you believe is the most important. When an item fails to meet the criteria you have established, you cross the item off your list of options. Your list of possible choices gets smaller and smaller as you cross items off the list until you eventually arrive at just one alternative.
 
The previous three processes are often used in cases where decisions are pretty straightforward, but what happens when there is a certain amount of risk, ambiguity, or uncertainty involved? For example, imagine that you are running late for your psychology class. Should you drive above the speed limit in order to get there on time, but risk getting a speeding ticket? Or should you drive the speed limit, risk being late, and possibly get docked points for missing a scheduled pop quiz? In this case, you have to weigh the possibility that you might be late for your appointment against the probability that you will get a speeding ticket.
 
When making a decision in such a situation, people tend to employ two different decision-making strategies: the availability heuristic and the representativeness heuristic. Remember, a heuristic is a rule-of-thumb mental short-cut that allows people to make decisions and judgments quickly.
 
The decision-making process can be both simple (such as randomly picking out of our available options) or complex (such as systematically rating different aspects of the existing choices). The strategy we use depends on various factors, including how much time we have to make the decision, the overall complexity of the decision, and the amount of ambiguity that is involved.
 The Availability Heuristic: When we are trying to determine how likely something is, we often base such estimates on how easily we can remember similar events happening in the past. For example, if you are trying to determine if you should drive over the speed limit and risk getting a ticket, you might think of how many times you have seen people getting pulled over by a police officer on a particular stretch of highway. If you cannot immediately think of any examples, you might decide to go ahead and take a chance, since the availability heuristic has led to you judge that few people get pulled over for speeding on your particular route. If you can think of numerous examples of people getting pulled over, you might decide to just play it safe and drive the suggested speed limit. The Representativeness Heuristic: This mental shortcut involves comparing our current situation to our prototype of a particular event or behavior. For example, when trying to determine whether you should speed to get to your class on time, you might compare yourself to your image a person who is most likely to get a speeding ticket. If your prototype is that of a careless teen that drives a hot-rod car and you are a young businesswoman who drives a sedan, you might estimate that the probability of getting a speeding ticket is quite low.",make decisions large small throughout every single day life want breakfast time meet friend dinner college many children want face decisions might tempt flip coin let chance determine fate case follow certain strategy series strategies order arrive decision many relatively minor decisions make every day flip coin terrible approach complex important decisions likely invest lot time research effort mental energy come right conclusion exactly process work follow major decision make strategies might use approach involve hinge decision solely single feature example imagine buy soap face wide variety options local superstore decide base decision price buy cheapest type soap available case ignore variables scent brand reputation effectiveness focus single feature single feature approach effective situations decision relatively simple press time however generally best strategy deal complex decisions method involve take account important feature possible choices systematically evaluate option approach tend better method make complex decisions example imagine interest buy new camera create list important feature want camera rate possible option scale cameras important advantage might get rat factor major drawbacks might get rat factor look option tally result determine option highest rat additive feature model great way determine best option variety choices imagine however quite time consume probably best decision make strategy use press time elimination aspects model first propose psychologist amos tversky approach evaluate option one characteristic time begin whatever feature believe important item fail meet criteria establish cross item list options list possible choices get smaller smaller cross items list eventually arrive one alternative previous three process often use case decisions pretty straightforward happen certain amount risk ambiguity uncertainty involve example imagine run late psychology class drive speed limit order get time risk get speed ticket drive speed limit risk late possibly get dock point miss schedule pop quiz case weigh possibility might late appointment probability get speed ticket make decision situation people tend employ two different decision make strategies availability heuristic representativeness heuristic remember heuristic rule thumb mental short cut allow people make decisions judgments quickly decision make process simple randomly pick available options complex systematically rat different aspects exist choices strategy use depend various factor include much time make decision overall complexity decision amount ambiguity involve availability heuristic try determine likely something often base estimate easily remember similar events happen past example try determine drive speed limit risk get ticket might think many time see people get pull police officer particular stretch highway immediately think examples might decide ahead take chance since availability heuristic lead judge people get pull speed particular route think numerous examples people get pull might decide play safe drive suggest speed limit representativeness heuristic mental shortcut involve compare current situation prototype particular event behavior example try determine whether speed get class time might compare image person likely get speed ticket prototype careless teen drive hot rod car young businesswoman drive sedan might estimate probability get speed ticket quite low

Each and every day we are faced with a multitude of decisions. Some of these are relatively small, such as deciding what to wear or what to have for breakfast. Others are big and can have a major influence on the course of our life, such as deciding where to go to school or whether to have children. Some decisions take time while others must be made in a split-second. While we employ a number of different decision-making strategies, we also often fall prey to a number of common fallacies, biases, and other decision-making problems.
 
Discover which decision-making mistakes and obstacles might be influencing the choices you make each and every day.
 
Decision-making problems are often the result of relying too heavily on mental shortcuts that have worked in the past. A heuristic is a sort of mental shortcut or rule of thumb that we utilize when making a judgment or decision. These heuristics help to lighten the mental load when we make choices, but they can also lead to errors.﻿﻿
 
Heuristics come with a couple of major advantages. First, they allow us to reach conclusions quickly. Second, heuristics also tend to work quite frequently. But as with all kinds of shortcuts, they can sometimes have disadvantages. They can sometimes lead us to make mistakes and misjudge situations.﻿﻿
 
Two common types of mental shortcuts are:
 
Another problem that can impact decision-making is our tendency to overestimate our own knowledge, skill, or judgment. In a classic experiment looking at this phenomenon, researchers Baruch Fischhoff, Paul Slovic, and Sarah Lichtenstein gave participants a variety of statements that had two different answers.﻿﻿ Participants were asked to select the answer they believed was correct and then rate how confident they were in their answers. When people stated that they were 100% confident in their answers, they were only correct about 80% of the time.
 
So why do people tend to be overconfident in their judgments?
 
One example of this overconfidence is a type of cognitive bias known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. This bias causes people to overestimate their own intelligence and abilities, essentially blinding them to their own incompetence.﻿﻿
 
No matter what the cause, this tendency to overestimate our own knowledge can lead to poor decisions. Imagine that you are traveling to Las Vegas with a friend. You've been there a couple of times before so you assume that you know the route you should take and you instruct your friend to take a particular exit that you believe is the correct one. Unfortunately, you misremembered the route and the exit turns out to be the wrong one. Your overconfidence in your ability to navigate the route led to the wrong choice and added considerable time on to your journey.
 
After something has happened, do you ever look back on the event and feel like you should have known what the outcome would be? In psychology, this tendency to look back retrospectively and easily spot all the signs leading up to a particular outcome is known as the hindsight bias.﻿﻿ Sometimes referred to as the ""I-knew-it-all-along"" phenomenon, this tendency can lead us to believe that we can actually predict consequences in situations that are really dependent upon chance.
 
For example, a gambler might mistakenly believe that they can accurately predict the outcome of a game of cards. In reality, there is no way that he can know what will happen since the game is based upon probability.
 
The hindsight bias can cause problems when it leads you to believe that you should have been able to foresee the outcome of situations that really weren't that predictable. As a result, you might make future decisions based on the information you learned from past mistakes. Rather than relying on factors related to the present situation, you might find yourself trying to guess the outcome based upon other, possibly unrelated experiences.
 
When making decisions, we sometimes see relationships that do not really exist. For example, we might believe that two unrelated events have some type of relationship simply because they occurred around the same time. In other cases, a one-time association between two different variables might lead us to assume that the two are somehow connected. For example, if you have a bad experience with a rude waitress, you might mistakenly believe that all waitresses are rude.
 
This tendency to see relationships where none exist is known in psychology as an illusory correlation.﻿﻿ In addition to leading to faulty beliefs, illusory correlations can also cause problems in the decision-making process. For example, imagine that you are interested in getting a new pet but you are not sure which type of pet you might want. A bad childhood experience with a dog might lead you to hold the mistaken belief that all dogs are aggressive and tend to bite. This can influence you as you make your choices about which pet to get, and might lead you to reject getting a puppy even though a dog would likely make a great pet for you.
 
While we all like to believe that we make our choices based on logic and rationality, the fact is that there are a number of decision-making problems that can complicate this process. Being aware of some of these potential pitfalls might help you make better decisions in the future.
 The Representativeness Heuristic: This involves judging the probability of an event based upon how similar it is to our existing prototype of such an event. For example, gamblers often judge the probability that they will win their next game based on whether or not they won the last game.﻿﻿ In reality, the games are not dependent upon each other and winning or losing is entirely up to chance. The Availability Heuristic: This involves judging the likelihood of an event based upon how quickly we can call similar events to mind. For example, you might believe that plane crashes are more common than they really are simply because you can quickly think of several examples of high profile airplane accidents. In a lot of cases, people might not realize how uninformed they are about a particular subject. Essentially, we don't know what we don't know.﻿﻿ In other cases, the information we have about a particular topic might simply be wrong or it might come from unreliable sources.",every day face multitude decisions relatively small decide wear breakfast others big major influence course life decide school whether children decisions take time others must make split second employ number different decision make strategies also often fall prey number common fallacies bias decision make problems discover decision make mistake obstacles might influence choices make every day decision make problems often result rely heavily mental shortcuts work past heuristic sort mental shortcut rule thumb utilize make judgment decision heuristics help lighten mental load make choices also lead errors heuristics come couple major advantage first allow reach conclusions quickly second heuristics also tend work quite frequently kinds shortcuts sometimes disadvantage sometimes lead make mistake misjudge situations two common type mental shortcuts another problem impact decision make tendency overestimate knowledge skill judgment classic experiment look phenomenon researchers baruch fischhoff paul slovic sarah lichtenstein give participants variety statements two different answer participants ask select answer believe correct rate confident answer people state confident answer correct time people tend overconfident judgments one example overconfidence type cognitive bias know dun kruger effect bias cause people overestimate intelligence abilities essentially blind incompetence matter cause tendency overestimate knowledge lead poor decisions imagine travel las vegas friend couple time assume know route take instruct friend take particular exit believe correct one unfortunately misremember route exit turn wrong one overconfidence ability navigate route lead wrong choice add considerable time journey something happen ever look back event feel like know outcome would psychology tendency look back retrospectively easily spot sign lead particular outcome know hindsight bias sometimes refer know along phenomenon tendency lead believe actually predict consequences situations really dependent upon chance example gambler might mistakenly believe accurately predict outcome game card reality way know happen since game base upon probability hindsight bias cause problems lead believe able foresee outcome situations really predictable result might make future decisions base information learn past mistake rather rely factor relate present situation might find try guess outcome base upon possibly unrelated experience make decisions sometimes see relationships really exist example might believe two unrelated events type relationship simply occur around time case one time association two different variables might lead assume two somehow connect example bad experience rude waitress might mistakenly believe waitress rude tendency see relationships none exist know psychology illusory correlation addition lead faulty beliefs illusory correlations also cause problems decision make process example imagine interest get new pet sure type pet might want bad childhood experience dog might lead hold mistake belief dog aggressive tend bite influence make choices pet get might lead reject get puppy even though dog would likely make great pet like believe make choices base logic rationality fact number decision make problems complicate process aware potential pitfalls might help make better decisions future representativeness heuristic involve judge probability event base upon similar exist prototype event example gamblers often judge probability win next game base whether last game reality game dependent upon win lose entirely chance availability heuristic involve judge likelihood event base upon quickly call similar events mind example might believe plane crash common really simply quickly think several examples high profile airplane accidents lot case people might realize uninformed particular subject essentially know know case information particular topic might simply wrong might come unreliable source

Think about how you feel after a long, busy day. After running errands, working on projects, and rushing to appointments, do you still feel like you have the energy to work on your goals? Once the day was done, you probably want to collapse in front of the TV and avoid doing anything at all.
 The reason you might find yourself so exhausted and burned out after a hard day can be influenced by what psychologists refer to as the ego-depletion effect. 
People are often faced with urges, desires, and natural tendencies that demand satisfaction. Giving in to such feelings is not always realistic, socially acceptable, or even healthy. In order to deal with such challenges, people must exert self-control in order to regulate their actions. Very often, we need to delay gratification of these urges until a more appropriate time and place.﻿﻿
 
Such self-management takes a great deal of mental effort, both cognitive and emotional. Some of these efforts require less willpower, while others demand much more. Even relatively minor acts of self-control can take a toll.
 
Ego depletion happens when people use up their available willpower on one task.﻿﻿ As a result, they are unable to exert the same level of self-control on subsequent, often unrelated tasks.
 
Willpower is a limited resource. The idea behind this theory is that willpower is like a muscle in that it can be both strengthened and fatigued. For example, if you exhaust yourself doing sprints, you will be less able to perform other physical tasks.
 Research has suggested that willpower and self-control are much the same. If you use your available energy and reach a state of ego depletion, you will have less self-control when faced with ensuing tasks. 
Self-control is important. Having good self-control is beneficial in a number of ways. People who possess high levels of self-control may have better relationships and higher achievement levels.﻿﻿ Those who lack self-control, on the other hand, can experience social conflict and poor academic performance.
 
The concept of ego depletion has taken some hard knocks in recent years.﻿﻿ Some reviews of the research have suggested that the effect may be less powerful than previously believed. And an updated meta-analysis concluded that the ego depletion does not exist at all.﻿﻿
 
Other researchers have proposed that ego depletion is not merely a result of draining limited self-control resources. Instead, they suggest that shifts in motivation, attention, and emotion play a critical role.﻿﻿
 
In a study exploring this theory, participants first completed a task designed to deplete willpower.﻿﻿ Some of the participants were then told that the purpose of the study was to provide evidence supporting a new therapy that would help people with Alzheimer's disease.
 
Participants who had been given this incentive were motivated to perform well for the benefit of Alzheimer's patients, leading them to outperform those in the control group. Motivation, the research suggests, plays an important part in ego depletion.
 
A variety of factors can contribute to ego depletion and make it harder to control yourself and regain your willpower, including:
 
There are many examples of how ego depletion can impact your behaviors in both large and small ways. What might happen if you find yourself low on self-control due to ego depletion?
 
Dieting is one of the most obvious examples of how ego depletion can sabotage your willpower.﻿﻿ You might spend all day diligently sticking to your diet. You eat a healthy breakfast and lunch, and even resist the sweet snacks that a co-worker brings into the office during your mid-afternoon break.
 
That night, as you arrive home from work, you find that your resolve has grown weak and you no longer have the self-control to stick to your diet.﻿﻿
 
Because you have expended so much mental energy throughout the day resisting the urge to indulge, you have reached a state of ego depletion by dinner time. Instead of eating the healthy meal you planned, you order take-out from your favorite fast-food restaurant and spend the evening watching TV and snacking on chips.
 
Ego depletion has also been shown to have an influence on what is known as prosocial behavior, or social interactions designed to help others.﻿﻿ When people reflect back on their own behaviors, they sometimes experience feelings of guilt. It is these guilty feelings that sometimes lead people to behave in prosocial ways.
 
Studies have shown that people who are ego depleted experience fewer feelings of guilt.﻿﻿ In studies where people were induced into an ego depleted state, these participants were less likely to experience feelings of guilt and therefore less likely to engage in prosocial actions.
 
So what impact does ego depletion actually have on your day-to-day life? There are a number of ways that this phenomenon can influence your behaviors and decisions:
 
Researchers have found that chronic dieters are more prone to ego depletion than non-dieters﻿﻿ . Because dieters apply so much willpower to controlling their food intake, they become more prone to losing self-control in the face of temptation.
 
For example, in one study participants (some who were dieting and some not) had to either sit next to a bowl of tempting snacks or far away from the desirable treats.﻿﻿ When the participants were later given the chance to eat ice cream, those who were dieting and had to sit right next to the bowl of treats ate more ice cream than the other participants. Because they had to use so much willpower to resist eating the snacks, these participants depleted their self-control resources.
 
Studies have also found that when shoppers experience ego depletion, they are more likely to make poor or impulsive purchasing decisions.﻿﻿ The sheer number of choices that consumers face can lead to such depletion. Consumers are forced to weigh an enormous number of choices. This complexity leads shoppers to become overwhelmed and frustrated.
 
Once a state of low self-control has been reached, buyers will purchase items based on simple criteria such as the cheapest item or the product linked to higher status. You have probably experienced this yourself if you have ever found yourself grabbing something off the shelf just because it was the lowest priced or a name brand that you recognized.
 
Mental toughness and determination are critical for athletic performance, but researchers have found that these tend to decline following difficult mental tasks.﻿﻿ This suggests that the depletion of willpower due to mental demands can actually impair performance on physical tasks. For student-athletes, this might mean that taking a challenging exam right before a game might actually hurt their performance.
 
Some research suggests that depleting self-regulation can also leave people susceptible to impulsive behaviors, including excessive or chronic alcohol consumption.﻿﻿ This can be challenging for individuals prone to substance use or abuse. Exhausting self-control on unrelated tasks might then make it more difficult to say no when temptation strikes. Ego depletion has also been linked to quitting smoking, contributing to smoking cessation failure.﻿﻿
 
Ego depletion can have a serious impact on your motivation, success, and performance. So what can you do to minimize the effects of this drain on willpower and self-control?
 
Researchers have found that being in a positive mood can have a beneficial impact on self-control. In some studies, ego depleted participants who had their moods boosted by watching comedy films actually performed just as well on self-control tasks as non-ego depleted participants.﻿﻿
 
In one study, researchers found that participants who viewed themselves as tired were also more likely to experience ego depletion.﻿﻿ Those who were able to step back and focus more on the big picture rather than just their own self-perceptions were able to reverse this effect. By focusing on your overall goals rather than just your feelings in the moment, you can minimize the impact of ego depletion.
 
Research has also shown that acts of self-affirmation can counteract the effects of ego depletion.﻿﻿ Self-affirmation refers to any behavior or thought that boosts integrity of the self. One simple but highly effective form of self-affirmation involves expressing your core values—the beliefs that you hold dear. During times when you are feeling exhausted and stressed, take a moment to remind yourself of the things that matter to you the most.
 
Sleep resets your self-control and provides you with the mental energy needed to have willpower throughout the day. Similarly, lack of sleep makes self-control more difficult. Think about how much harder it is to resist junk food when you're sleep deprived than when you have a good night's rest.
 
Managing your stress can not only help strengthen your self-control, but it can help you better manage those areas in your life that are depleting your energy and willpower. Taking time to practice relaxation strategies throughout the day, like deep breathing or mindfulness meditation, can also help recharge your mental energy.
 
Understanding ego depletion has important implications. Because self-control plays such a critical role in so many areas of life, finding ways to improve it can enhance overall well-being.
 People are often encouraged to marshal their willpower to overcome any challenge—but sometimes the act of doing so can leave us lacking control later on when we really need it. 
If you feel like your resources are depleted, look for ways to boost your willpower during critical moments. Uplifting activities like enjoying a funny movie or focusing on the things that are important to you can give you a boost when you are feeling depleted.
 Emotional distress: If you're feeling emotional distress, your willpower will be depleted more quickly. Unfamiliarity: It takes more energy to try something new. Illusory fatigue: If you think a situation will be mentally taxing, you'll become mentally fatigued faster. Low blood sugar: Having low blood sugar can make it more difficult to resist temptation.﻿﻿ Choice: If you're forced to do something, you'll have less self-control than if you were allowed to make your own decision. Cognitive dissonance: Doing or saying something that contradicts your beliefs can diminish your self-control. Heart rate: Researchers have found that more your heart rate varies, the less self-control you have.﻿﻿ Hormones: Women have been found to experience decreased self-control during premenstrual syndrome, as the ovaries work harder during this phase of menstruation.﻿﻿ Age: Older people may be more resistant to ego depletion than their younger counterparts.",think feel long busy day run

How exactly do psychologists define creativity? Studying creativity can be a tricky process. Not only is creativity a complex topic in and of itself, but there is also no clear consensus on how exactly to define creativity. Many of the most common definitions suggest that creativity is the tendency to solve problems or create new things in novel ways.﻿﻿
 
Two of the primary components of creativity include:﻿﻿
 
In his book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggested that creativity can often be seen in a few different situations.﻿﻿
 
Experts also tend to distinguish between different types of creativity. The “four c” model of creativity suggests that there are four different types:﻿﻿
 
Csikszentmihalyi suggests that creative people tend to possess are ​a variety of traits that contribute to their innovative thinking. Some of these key traits include:﻿﻿
 
While some people seem to come by creativity naturally, there are things that you can do to increase your own creativity. As Csikszentmihalyi has noted, creativity requires both a fresh perspective combined with discipline. As Thomas Edison famously suggested, genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.﻿﻿
 
The late Maya Angelou also suggested that thinking creativity helps foster even greater creativity:﻿﻿
 
""Creativity or talent, like electricity, is something I don’t understand but something I’m able to harness and use. While electricity remains a mystery, I know I can plug into it and light up a cathedral or a synagogue or an operating room and use it to help save a life. Or I can use it to electrocute someone. Like electricity, creativity makes no judgment. I can use it productively or destructively. The important thing is to use it. You can’t use up creativity. The more you use it, the more you have.""
 Originality: The idea should be something new that is not simply an extension of something else that already exists. Functionality: The idea needs to actually work or possess some degree of usefulness. People who seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts. People who perceive the world with a fresh perspective, have insightful ideas and make important personal discoveries. These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them. People who make great creative achievements that become known to the entire world. Inventors and artists such as Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso would fall into this category. “Mini-c” creativity involves personally meaningful ideas and insights that are known only to the self. “Little-c” creativity involves mostly everyday thinking and problem-solving. This type of creativity helps people solve everyday problems they face and adapt to changing environments. “Pro-C” creativity takes place among professionals who are skilled and creative in their respective fields. These individuals are creative in their vocation or profession but do not achieve eminence for their works. “Big-C” creativity involves creating works and ideas that are considered great in a particular field. This type of creativity leads to eminence and acclaim and often leads to world-changing creations such as medical innovations, technological advances, and artistic achievements. Energy: Creative people tend to possess a great deal of both physical and mental energy. However, they also tend to spend a great deal of time quietly thinking and reflecting. Intelligence: Psychologists have long believed that intelligence plays a critical role in creativity. In Terman’s famous longitudinal study of gifted children, researchers found that while high IQ was necessary for great creativity, not all people with high IQs are creative. Csikszentmihalyi believes that creative people must be smart, but they must be capable of looking at things in fresh, even naïve, ways. Discipline: Creative people do not just sit around waiting for inspiration to strike. They ​are playful, yet they are also disciplined in the pursuit of their work and passions.",exactly psychologists define creativity study creativity tricky process creativity complex topic also clear consensus exactly define creativity many common definitions suggest creativity tendency solve problems create new things novel ways two primary components creativity include book creativity flow psychology discovery invention psychologist mihaly csikszentmihalyi suggest creativity often see different situations experts also tend distinguish different type creativity four model creativity suggest four different type csikszentmihalyi suggest creative people tend possess variety traits contribute innovative think key traits include people seem come creativity naturally things increase creativity csikszentmihalyi note creativity require fresh perspective combine discipline thomas edison famously suggest genius one percent inspiration ninety nine percent perspiration late maya angelou also suggest think creativity help foster even greater creativity creativity talent like electricity something understand something able harness use electricity remain mystery know plug light cathedral synagogue operate room use help save life use electrocute someone like electricity creativity make judgment use productively destructively important thing use use creativity use originality idea something new simply extension something else already exist functionality idea need actually work possess degree usefulness people seem stimulate interest variety unusual thoughts people perceive world fresh perspective insightful ideas make important personal discoveries individuals make creative discoveries generally know people make great creative achievements become know entire world inventors artists thomas edison pablo picasso would fall category mini creativity involve personally meaningful ideas insights know self little creativity involve mostly everyday think problem solve type creativity help people solve everyday problems face adapt change environments pro creativity take place among professionals skilled creative respective field individuals creative vocation profession achieve eminence work big creativity involve create work ideas consider great particular field type creativity lead eminence acclaim often lead world change creations medical innovations technological advance artistic achievements energy creative people tend possess great deal physical mental energy however also tend spend great deal time quietly think reflect intelligence psychologists long believe intelligence play critical role creativity terman famous longitudinal study gift children researchers find high necessary great creativity people high iqs creative csikszentmihalyi believe creative people must smart must capable look things fresh even ways discipline creative people sit around wait inspiration strike playful yet also discipline pursuit work passions

In a time when many middle school kids carry around $600 phones that they take for granted, teaching gratitude can feel like an uphill battle. But despite the challenges you might face in helping kids feel grateful in a world that seems to value overabundance, it can be worthwhile.
 
A 2019 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies﻿﻿ found that gratitude is linked to happiness in children by age 5. This means that instilling gratitude in your kids at a young age could help them grow up to be happier people.
 
According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of School Psychology﻿﻿ , grateful children (ages 11 to 13) tend to be happier, more optimistic, and have better social support. They also report more satisfaction with their schools, families, communities, friends, and themselves. Grateful kids also tend to give more social support to others as well.
 
According to a 2011 study published in Psychological Assessment﻿﻿ , grateful teens (ages 14 to 19) are more satisfied with their lives, use their strengths to improve their communities, are more engaged in their schoolwork and hobbies, and have better grades. They’ve also been shown to be less envious, depressed, and materialistic than their less grateful counterparts.
 
It’s true that much of the gratitude research focuses on adults, but the benefits of gratitude are numerous for everyone. A 2010 study published in Clinical Psychology Review﻿﻿ linked gratitude to everything from improved psychological well-being to better physical health. Grateful people tend to sleep better and even live longer.
 
A 2018 study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology﻿﻿ found that grateful adults are happier and more hopeful. Gratitude was a better predictor of hope and happiness than other constructs, like forgiveness, patience, and even self-control.
 
Additionally, the study found that people who were grateful for things that happened to them in the past, felt happier in the present and more hopeful about their future. Perhaps giving your kids a childhood they feel grateful about now will help them reflect more on reasons to be grateful as an adult.
 
So clearly there are a lot of good reasons to help kids experience and express gratitude. Here are a few strategies that can help your kids feel more grateful.
 
Encourage your child to say “Thank you” on a regular basis. Offer gentle reminders like, “Your brother let you go first. What should you say to him?” or “What do you say to Grandma for giving you a cookie?”
 While it may seem like forcing a ”thank you” doesn’t stir up any real gratitude, consider it a first step in the process. It can help kids start to recognize when others have given them something, whether it’s something tangible like a gift, or intangible like time. 
So even if it doesn’t seem like genuine appreciation when your child needs a reminder, encouraging them to verbally express appreciation can be an important learning tool for genuine gratitude down the line.
 
You can also encourage your kids to write “thank you” notes to people who give them gifts or show them kindness. Your child might color a picture for a grandparent who purchased a birthday gift for them. Or you might encourage your teen to write a “thank you” letter to a special coach who has made an impact on their lives.
 
Make sure to point out times when your child shows gratitude without a prompt from you. Praise prosocial behavior by saying things like, “I really like the way you thanked your friend for sharing with you today,” or “Nice job remembering to say ‘thank you’ to your teacher when she reminded you to get your backpack.” Positive attention will reinforce the importance of showing gratitude.
 
Once your child remembers to say “thank you” on a regular basis, it can be time to dig a little deeper to ensure that they aren’t just going through the socially-prescribed motions of saying “Thank you.” Start having conversations about what it means to be thankful, and take their understanding of gratitude to a whole new level by incorporating more gratitude components.
 
The Raising Grateful Children Project at UNC Chapel Hill has revealed that gratitude has four parts:
 
Researchers found that most parents stayed focused on what children do to show gratitude. While 85% of parents said they prompted their kids to say “thank you,” only 39% encouraged children to show gratitude in a way that went beyond good manners. In addition, only a third of parents asked their kids how a gift made them feel, and only 22% asked why they thought someone had given them a gift.
 
Researchers from UNC encourage parents to ask kids questions to help foster a deeper sense of gratitude. Here are some questions that can help kids experience all four gratitude components:
 Whenever your child receives a physical gift or someone shows kindness to them, strike up a conversation that helps them experience more gratitude. You also might start conversations that show how you both think, feel, and respond to the people and gifts you’re grateful for in your life. 
There are many things your child can do to show appreciation for other people. This might involve returning a favor, like loaning a toy to a friend who is kind.
 
Or it could involve an act of service like doing yard work for a relative who attends their basketball games.
 
Make it clear that there are many ways to show people that you’re grateful for all they do.
 
You might even decide to take on a family project, like writing thank you letters to the first responders in your community after a natural disaster. Make it clear that you don’t need to reserve gratitude for those individuals that you know personally—there are many people in the community whom you might feel grateful for as well.
 
A 2016 study published in Applied Developmental Science﻿﻿ found that grateful parents tend to raise grateful children.
 
There’s a good chance this is because kids learn to be grateful by hearing and seeing their parents experience gratitude.
 
Here are several ways you can model gratitude for your children:
 
A family project can be a good way to get everyone involved in expressing gratitude.
 
For example, you could create a family bulletin board where everyone can add notes about what they’re thankful for. Whether you use sticky notes, a whiteboard where everyone writes with a marker, or colorful pages that can be tacked up, either way it’s a great family project.
 
It can be a great conversation piece as well. You might talk about certain things someone feels grateful for or you might talk about how fast the board fills up because you have so many good things going on in life.
 
You could also create a gratitude jar that everyone contributes to. Keep a jar in an easily accessible place, like the kitchen, and keep some slips of paper handy. Encourage everyone to write down something they’re grateful for (maybe once a day) and put it in the jar.
 
Then, you can read over the slips of paper together as a family—maybe once a week or once a month.
 
It can be a great way to honor all the good things happening in everyone’s lives.
 
No matter what type of family project you start, make it something that gets everyone thinking and talking more about gratitude. Listening to the things everyone else is grateful for can encourage even more gratitude in the family.
 
Make it a habit to regularly express gratitude in your family. Here are some examples of rituals you might establish:
 
Although it might seem like gratitude should be spontaneous rather than rehearsed, making gratitude a habit can ensure that kids practice it on a regular basis, and it can become like second-nature.
 
Help your kids see that something good can come from difficult circumstances. If a soccer game gets rescheduled due to rain, talk about the bright side of the situation. Say something like, ""Well at least we don't have to be outside in the cold. We can play board games together instead and that will be fun.""
 
You might also point out how to be grateful for what you had, even when it's no longer here. For example, you might say, ""It's really sad our fish died but I'm grateful we got to have him for six months."" Of course you don't want to sound uncaring and callous but you can make it clear that you can be both grateful and sad at the same time while honoring a loss.
 
Ask questions that help your child discover the potential silver lining in a tough situation. Ask, ""What's something good that could come from something hard like this?""
 
In a really tough situation, asking that question too soon might seem insensitive (like 10 minutes after failing a test). So you might give it some time before encouraging your child to look on the bright side. But helping your child do this often, you'll teach them to begin doing it on their own and they'll start to see that they have a lot to be grateful for, even on their worst days.
 
Make gratitude a priority in your home. Not only will your child benefit, but the adults will likely get a much-needed boost in happiness and well-being also. Experiment with different strategies to help determine which gratitude practices help everyone best experience and express their grateful feelings.
 
Of course, there will be times when your kids seem to be ungrateful. This doesn’t mean you’ve failed in the gratitude department, however. It’s normal for kids to experience entitlement at times.
 
So turn these times into teachable moments. Work on new gratitude strategies and keep modeling how to be thankful, and you’ll likely see these moments of entitlement fade away.
 Noticing – Recognizing the things you have to be grateful for. Thinking – Thinking about why you’ve been given those things. Feeling – The emotions you experience as a result of the things you’ve been given. Doing – The way you express appreciation. Notice – What do you have in your life to be grateful for? Are there things to be grateful for beyond the actual gifts someone has given you? Are you grateful for any people in your life? Think – What do you think about this present? Do you think you should give something to the person who gave it to you? Do you think you earned the gift? Do you think the person gave you a gift because they thought they had to or because they wanted to? Feel – Does it make you feel happy to get this gift? What does it feel like inside? What about this gift makes you feel happy? Do – Is there a way to show how you feel about this gift? Does the feeling you have about this gift make you want to share this feeling by giving to someone else? Say “Thank you.” Whether you thank the clerk at the store or you thank your child for clearing the table, make sure you’re thanking people often. Talk about gratitude. Make it a point to share what you’re grateful for. Even when you have a rough day or something bad happens, point out that there’s still a lot to feel grateful for. Instead of complaining about the rain, talk about being grateful that the plants are being watered so you’ll have food to eat. Express gratitude. When your child sees you writing “thank you” notes or sending a token of appreciation to someone, you’ll teach them to do the same. Everyone takes turns during dinner sharing one thing they’re grateful for from their day. At bedtime, you ask each child to say three things they feel grateful for. During the car ride to school, everyone thanks someone else in the car for something. Each Sunday night at dinner, everyone discusses how they’ll express gratitude and who they’ll express it to over the course of the week. Every Saturday morning, everyone writes a note of appreciation to someone for a specific reason.",time many middle school kid carry around phone take grant teach gratitude feel like uphill battle

Insomnia is a common problem throughout the world. According to estimates, it is believed to affect approximately 33% of the world's population. Even people without chronic insomnia often struggle with sleep problems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a third of adults in the U.S. report that they get less than the recommended amount of sleep each night. Because of this, it is important to understand the potential impact that lack of sleep may have on health, including mental health and well-being.
 
It’s no secret that sleep plays an important role in good physical and mental health. Sleep deprivation can leave you feeling irritable and exhausted in the short-term, but it can also have serious long-term health consequences as well. Lack of sleep is linked to a number of unfavorable health consequences including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.
 Some psychiatric conditions can cause sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can also exacerbate the symptoms of many mental conditions including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. 
Research suggests that the relationship between sleep and mental health is complex. While sleep has long been known to be a consequence of many psychiatric conditions, more recent views suggest that sleep can also play a causal role in both the development and maintenance of different mental health problems.﻿﻿
 
In other words, sleep problems can lead to changes in mental health, but mental health conditions can also worsen problems with sleep. Lack of sleep may trigger the onset of certain psychological conditions, although researchers are not completely certain of the underlying reasons for this. Because of this circular relationship between your sleep patterns and your mental state, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are having problems falling or staying asleep.
 
If you’ve ever struggled to get through the day after a night of tossing and turning, you are well-acquainted with the disruptive effects of sleep deprivation. Mood changes including increased irritability and anger can make it much harder to cope with even the minor stresses of daily life.
 
Poor sleep can make it much more difficult to cope with even relatively minor stress. Daily hassles can turn into major sources of frustration. You might find yourself feeling frazzled, short-tempered, and frustrated by everyday annoyances. Poor sleep itself can even turn into a source of stress. You might know that you need to get a good night's sleep, but then find yourself worrying that you won't be able to fall or stay asleep each night.
 
Insomnia and other sleep problems can be a symptom of depression, but more recently, research has implicated lack of sleep in actually causing depression.
 
One analysis of 21 different studies found that people who experience insomnia have a two-fold risk of developing depression over those who do not have problems sleeping.﻿﻿ The question then is whether helping people improve their sleep might actually lessen their chances of developing depression.
 Researchers suggest that addressing insomnia early-on may be an effective preventative measure to help reduce the risk of depression, although more study into this possibility is needed. 
Treating insomnia is obviously an important way to help improve psychological health and the possibility that such treatments may also be an effective tool for preventing or even treating mental health problems is promising.
 
In a study looking at more than 3,700 participants, researchers investigated the impact of poor sleep on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and paranoia.﻿﻿ Some of the participants were treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for their insomnia, while others did not receive any treatment. The researchers found that those who had received CBT also showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, paranoia, and nightmares. They also reported improved overall well-being, including their ability to function at home and work.
 
As with many other psychological conditions, the relationship between sleep and anxiety appears to go both directions. People with anxiety tend to experience more sleep disturbances, but experiencing sleep deprivation can also contribute to feelings of anxiety. This can become a cycle that perpetuates both the sleep and anxiety issues.
 
Additionally, sleep problems appear to be a risk factor for developing anxiety disorders. One study found that problems with sleep were a predictor for generalized anxiety disorder in children and teens between the ages of 9 and 16.﻿﻿ Those who struggle with sleep problems may be more likely to develop an anxiety condition, particularly if their sleep problems are prolonged and left untreated.
 
Coping with feelings of anxiety can be that much more difficult when you are tired from chronic sleep disturbances. Because of this, poor sleep can make the symptoms of anxiety disorders much worse. For example, sleep deprivation is not only a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affecting between 80% to 90% of people with the condition, it is also believed to play a role in both the development and maintenance of this disorder.
 
However, even otherwise healthy people can experience negative mental health effects of poor sleep. For example, one study found that acute sleep deprivation led to an increase in anxiety and distress levels in healthy adults.﻿﻿ So while you might not even if you normally do not experience a great deal of anxiety, poor sleep may leave you feeling agitated and distraught.
 
Sleep disturbances are very common among people with bipolar disorder. Such problems can include insomnia, irregular sleep-wake cycles, and nightmares. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating periods of depressed and elevated moods.
 Sleep changes can be a symptom of the condition, but sleep problems can also play a role in the course of the condition, treatment outcomes, and the individual's overall quality of life. 
Reduced sleep can also cause symptoms of mania or hypomania. Research suggests that changes in the normal sleep/wake cycle preceded the onset of a manic episode in 25% to 65% of participants.﻿﻿ If you have bipolar disorder, be sure to talk to your doctor about any sleep difficulties that you may be having.
 
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric condition, affecting as many as 5.3% of children between the ages of six and 17 years old. ADHD is associated with sleep problems, and research also suggests that sleep disturbances may be a predictor or even a contributor to symptoms of the condition. Studies have found that between 25% and 55% of children who have ADHD also experience sleep disturbances.﻿﻿
 
Children with ADHD may experience a number of sleep-related problems including difficulty falling or staying asleep, difficulty waking, sleep breathing issues, night waking, and daytime sleepiness.
 
ADHD treatment frequently begins with an assessment of current sleep habits and patterns in order to address underlying sleep problems. Studies have found that sleep interventions can help improve the severity of ADHD symptoms in addition to improving overall quality of life.﻿﻿
 
The good news is that because sleep problems are usually considered modifiable risk factors for many conditions, findings ways to improve sleep quality and quantity can be helpful in relieving the symptoms of these mental disorders. This does not mean that getting more sleep is a cure or quick-fix, but getting better sleep can be an important part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
 It is the bidirectional relationship between sleep and mental health that offers some promise—researchers hope that finding ways to improve sleep may have a beneficial impact on a number of conditions. In practical terms, if improving sleep could improve mental health, interventions designed to help people sleep could be a useful tool during psychological treatment. 
While more research is needed to learn more about the effectiveness of such treatments, but there is some evidence that treatments that focus on sleep improvements can relieve some symptoms. For example, one study found that targeted sleep treatments were useful for reducing the symptoms of PTSD.﻿﻿
 
Research has also shown that psychological treatments can be helpful for treating some sleep disorders. One study, for example, found that internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was helpful for relieving symptoms of insomnia.﻿﻿
 
If you have been struggling with a sleep problem or are experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness, talk to your doctor about your treatment options. Your doctor may want to conduct a sleep study in order to get a better look at your nighttime sleep patterns. They can then recommend treatments that are appropriate for any underlying sleep disturbance that might be impairing your ability to rest. Treating your sleep issues early is important for protecting both your physical and mental well-being.
 
The recommendations for treating poor sleep or sleep disturbances are generally the same whether or not you have a psychiatric condition. Preliminary approaches usually focus on lifestyle changes you can make that can help you get a better night’s sleep. Avoiding sleep interrupters (such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol) and practicing good sleep habits are examples of lifestyle changes you can make that can help.
 
In addition to seeking help from medical professionals, there are also steps that you can take on your own to improve your sleep and well-being. Having good sleep hygiene, or practices that support sleep, are critical to staying rested and avoiding daytime sleepiness.
 
Some things you can do:
 
Talk to a mental health professional if you suspect that your sleep problems might be caused by or contributing to a mental health condition. Depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders can interfere with sleep—but addressing your sleep problems may also have a positive impact on your psychological symptoms.
 If lifestyle changes do not relieve sleep problems, your doctor may recommend psychotherapy and medications. 
The negative effects of poor sleep are well-documented, including the profound impact on mental health and emotional well-being. Poor sleep may often be a symptom or consequence of an existing psychological condition, but sleep problems are also thought to cause or contribute to the onset of different mental disorders including depression and anxiety.
 
For this reason, addressing sleep problems early-on is important to help protect your overall health and wellness. Making lifestyle changes that promote good sleep can help, but talk to your doctor if your sleep problems persist. An underlying sleep disorder or a medical condition might be playing a role in your sleep issues.
 Limit napping. Too much sleep during the day can have an effect on your ability to fall or stay asleep at night. Naps of 20 to 30 minutes a day can help you feel more alert and rested without interrupting your nightly sleep. Establish a nightly routine. Stick to a set of habits that help prepare you for rest each night. Take a bath, read a book, or practice a few minutes of meditation to calm your body. Repeat these routines each night to help set the mood for a solid night’s sleep. Avoid caffeine or stimulants too close to bedtime. Consuming coffee, soda, or other caffeinated products in the late afternoon or evening can make it difficult to fall asleep. Turn off your devices. Watching television or playing on your phone at bedtime can make it more difficult to relax and settle down for sleep. Try setting limits on when you quit using your devices before bed.",insomnia common problem throughout world accord estimate believe affect approximately world population even people without chronic

Body positivity refers to the assertion that all people deserve to have a positive body image, regardless of how society and popular culture view ideal shape, size, and appearance.
 
Some of the goals of the body positivity movement include:
 
Body positivity is not just about challenging how society views people based upon their physical size and shape, however. It also recognizes that judgments are often made based on race, gender, sexuality, and disability. 
 
Body positivity also aims to help people understand how popular media messages contribute to the relationship that people have with their bodies, including how they feel about food, exercise, clothing, health, identity, and self-care. By better understanding the effect that such influences have, the hope is that people can develop a healthier and more realistic relationship with their bodies.
 
Body positivity has its roots in the fat acceptance movement of the late 1960s. Fat acceptance focuses on ending the culture of fat-shaming and discrimination against people based upon their size or body weight. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance was first established in 1969 and continues to work to change how people talk about weight.
 
The term ""body positive"" emerged in 1996 when a psychotherapist and an individual who had been through treatment for an eating disorder founded the website thebodypositive.org. The site offers resources and educational materials designed to help people feel good about their bodies by taking the focus off of losing weight through unhealthy diet and exercise efforts.
 
The body positivity movement in its current form began to emerge around 2012, initially focusing on challenging unrealistic feminine beauty standards. As the movement grew in popularity, the original focus on acceptance of weight began to shift toward a message that “all bodies are beautiful.” 
 
While body positivity has become increasingly popular, people continue to be confused about exactly what it means. Part of the reason why body positivity is so misunderstood is due to the fact that there are so many different definitions for what the movement means.
 
 Depending on who you ask, body positivity can mean:
 
Body positivity also means enjoying the body you have and not beating yourself up over changes that happen naturally due to aging, pregnancy, or lifestyle choices.
 
Instagram played a pivotal role in the rise of the body positivity movement. In recent years, a number of magazines and companies have incorporated efforts to be more body positive in their publications and marketing efforts. Some magazines have stopped airbrushing models, while companies including Dove and Aerie have developed marketing campaigns incorporating body positivity messages.
 
One of the major goals of body positivity is to address some of the ways that body image influences mental health and well-being. Having a healthy body image plays a role in how people feel about their appearance and even how they judge their self-worth. Research suggests that having a negative body image is associated with an increased risk for some mental conditions including depression and eating disorders.
 One study found that even brief exposure to media messages portraying an ""ideal physique"" was linked to increased body image concerns and increased eating disorder symptoms. ﻿﻿ 
Body image refers to a person's subjective perception of their own body—which may be different from how their body actually appears. Feelings, thoughts, and behaviors related to body image can have a major impact on your mental health and how you treat yourself.
 
The formation of body image starts early in life. Unfortunately, even young children may suffer from body dissatisfaction. A report published by Common Sense Media found that more than 50% of girls and nearly 33% of boys between the ages of 6 and 8 felt that their ideal body weight was less than their current weight. Results also revealed that 25% of kids had tried some type of dieting behavior by the age of seven.﻿﻿
 
Problems that can emerge as a result of poor body image include:
 
Research has consistently shown that exposure to depictions of the ""thin ideal"" are associated with both behavioral and emotional symptoms related to disordered eating.﻿﻿ It is not just exposure to these images that pose a danger; it is the development of beliefs that beauty, success, and esteem are determined by thinness. Studies have also found that when people internalize these ideas, they are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction and engage in unnecessary dieting.﻿﻿
 
Body positivity strives to address these issues by helping people recognize the influences that contribute to poor body image. The hope is that people will then be able to adjust their body expectations and feel more positive and accepting of their own bodies. Such acceptance may then help combat the toll that poor body image has on mental and physical health.
 
While the body positivity message is intended to help people feel better about themselves, it isn’t without its problems and critics. 
 
For example, one problem is the idea that body positivity implies that people should do whatever they think they need to do in order to feel positive about how they look. Unfortunately, the popular messages that people are bombarded with include the idea that thinner, fitter people are happier, healthier, and more beautiful. This idealization of thinness can then contribute to people engaging in unhealthy actions—including excessive exercise or extreme diets—under the guise of feeling ""body positive.""
 
Another criticism of body positivity is that it can be non-inclusive. Depictions of body positivity messages tend to exclude people of color as well as those who are disabled, LGBTQ, and non-binary.
 The body images often portrayed in body-positive messages often still conform to a specific beauty ideal; many people simply don’t feel included in body positivity.  
Actress Jameela Jamil, who stars on the tv series The Good Place, is often described as one of the faces of the body positivity movement, which she suggests is miscategorization. In an Instagram post, Jamil explained that body positivity is essential for people who are ""not believed by doctors, who are abused in the street, and who can't find clothing in their size."" 
 
However, she also recognizes that the movement isn't right for everyone and that many people feel shut out of the body positivity conversation. 
 
Instead, Jamil suggests that she advocates for body liberation or even body neutrality. This approach involves taking your body out of the center of your self-image. She has the privilege of taking such a stance, she notes, because she is not persecuted because of her size. Other people, those who the body positivity movement is specifically aimed at, simply do not have that luxury.
 
Another criticism of the body positivity trend is that it makes the appearance of the body one of the most important elements of a person’s self-perception. It neglects all of the other elements of a person’s identity that are more important than how a person looks. In this aspect, Jamil’s stance, suggesting that people should stop making the body the determinant of self-worth and self-perception, might be a healthier, more inclusive approach.
 
Body positivity is designed to foster acceptance and love of your body, but it can be a struggle that adds another element of pressure and impossible standards to live up to. The body positivity message is that you should change how you feel about your body, but can also be just one more demand. 
 
Simply telling people to accept themselves and be resilient in the face of the bombardment of images promoting the thin ideal can be damaging. Telling people to ignore the dominant beauty ideal isn’t realistic. It can create more pressure for a person who is already feeling anxious, negative, and devalued. Popular culture tells people that they are flawed—but then demands that they have a positive attitude about it. Not feeling positive about your body can then lead to shame and guilt. 
 Research has even found that when people with low self-esteem repeat positive affirmations that they don't actually believe in, the results tend to backfire, leaving people feeling even worse about themselves than they did before.﻿﻿ 
This does not mean that you shouldn't say nice things or think positive thoughts about yourself. But simply covering up negative thinking with positive messages may be harmful. A better approach would be to work on replacing negative thought patterns with more realistic ones.
 
So what can you do to maintain a healthy body image? Whether or not the body positivity movement speaks to you, there are ideas from this approach that may help you feel better about your body and less obsessed with chasing “perfection.”
 
It’s ok to admit that you don’t necessarily love everything about your body. It’s ok to feel neutral or even indifferent about your body. Your worth and value do not lie in your shape or your size or in any other aspect of your appearance. Body image does play a part in self-concept, but it isn’t everything.
 Focus on taking the mental spotlight off your body and try to base your self-perceptions on other parts of yourself. 
None of these things are easy. They take continual effort and, in most cases, it’s not something you can perfectly achieve. There will be moments when you feel weak, when you dislike aspects of yourself, and when you compare yourself to others. The key is to keep trying to find new ways to avoid the negative thought patterns that contribute to poor body image.
 
Self-care can sometimes masquerade as a way to change or control your appearance, but self-care should focus on doing things that make you feel good about the body you have now. Show respect for your body. Eat healthy meals because it fuels your mind and body. Exercise because it helps you feel strong and energized, not because you're trying to change or control your body.
 
Wear and buy clothes for the body you have now—not for some planned future version of yourself. You might be holding on to your “thin clothes” because you plan to eventually lose weight, but such habits can make it hard to feel good about yourself today. Look for things that make you feel comfortable and good about how you look. Purge your closet of clothes that don't fit your current physique. Your body may change in size and shape in the future, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be able to look at feel good about yourself in the here and now.
 
Purge your social media feeds of accounts that don’t make you feel good about yourself. If you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to others, you’re less likely to feel good about yourself. Follow accounts that spark your interests and that leave you with positive feelings. On Instagram in particular, many accounts are focused only on portraying perfection or an idealized image of the body.
 Try following body positive accounts that are inclusive of all body types, shapes, colors, genders, and abilities. 
Recent research presented at the American Psychological Association’s 2016 annual conference indicates that body dissatisfaction may be on the decline.﻿﻿ In the meta-analysis, researchers looked at over 250 studies involving more than 100,000 participants over a 31 year time period. While women consistently report more body dissatisfaction than men, the results indicated that this dissatisfaction has declined in recent years. 
 
 These findings are a positive sign that may suggest that the body acceptance and body positivity movements are having an effect on how women and girls view themselves. While it may be an uphill battle, increasing the representation of all body types in popular media may help combat poor body image.

researchers believe that body dissatisfaction may play an important role in explaining this gender difference in depression rates.﻿﻿ Low self-esteem: Research has found that body dissatisfaction is

A digital detox refers to a period of time when a person refrains from using tech devices such as smartphones, televisions, computers, tablets, and social media sites. “Detoxing” from digital devices is often seen as a way to focus on real-life social interactions without distractions. By forgoing digital devices, at least temporarily, people can let go of the stress that stems from constant connectivity.
 
Before you decide if it is right for you, consider some of the potential benefits and methods of doing a digital detox.
 
For many people, being connected and immersed in the digital world is just a part of everyday life. According to research from the Nielsen Company, the average U.S. adult spends around 11 hours each day listening to, watching, reading, or interacting with media. 
 
There are many reasons why you might want to give up your mobile phone and other devices for a brief time. You might want to enjoy time to yourself without the interference that your phone and other devices create. In other cases, you might feel like your device use has become excessive and is adding too much stress to your life. 
 
In some situations, you might even feel like you are addicted to your devices. While technology addiction is not formally recognized as a disorder in the DSM-5, many experts believe that tech and device overuse represents a very real behavioral addiction that can lead to physical, psychological, and social problems.
 In a poll conducted by the organization Common Sense Media, 50% of teens reported that they felt that they were addicted to their mobile devices. A whopping 78% of the teen respondents said that they check their digital devices hourly. 
While people often feel that they can't imagine life without their tech devices, research and surveys have found that technology use can also contribute to stress. 
 
In the American Psychological Associations' annual Stress in America survey, a fifth of U.S. adults (around 18%) cited technology use as a significant source of stress in their life. For many, it is the ever-present digital connection and constant need to keep checking emails, texts, and social media that accounted for the majority of this tech stress.
 
One study conducted by researchers in Sweden found that heavy technology use among young adults was linked to sleeping problems, depressive symptoms, and increased stress levels.
 
Evidence also suggests that heavy device use, particularly prior to bedtime, can interfere with sleep quality and quantity. One study found that children who use digital devices at bedtime had significantly worse and less sleep. The study also found a connection between nighttime tech use and increased body mass index. 
 
Researchers have also found that in-bed electronic social media use has adverse effects on sleep and mood. The study found that 70% of participants checked social media on their phones while in bed, with 15% spending an hour or more on social media while in bed. The results found that using social media when you are in bed at night increases the likelihood of anxiety, insomnia, and shorter sleep duration.
 
 A study published in the journal Child Development found that heavy daily technology use was associated with an increased risk for mental health problems among adolescents. More time spent using digital technologies was linked to increased symptoms of ADHD and conduct disorder, as well as worse self-regulation.
 Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania recently published the first experimental research linking the use of social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram to decreased well-being. The results revealed that limiting social media use decreased symptoms of depression and loneliness. 
That feeling of always being connected can make it difficult to create boundaries between your home life and work life. Even when you are at home or on vacation, it can be hard to resist the temptation to check your email, respond to a text from a colleague, or check in on your social media accounts. 
 
In a study published in the journal Applied Research in Quality of Life, researchers found that technology use played a role in determining an individual's work-life balance. The study suggested that the use of internet and mobile technologies influenced overall job satisfaction, job stress, and feelings of overwork.
 
Doing a digital detox may help you establish a healthier, less stressful work-life balance.
 
If you spend time on social media, you have probably found yourself comparing your own life to your friends, family, total strangers, and celebs. You might find yourself thinking that everyone else seems to be leading a fuller, richer, or more exciting life based on the tiny, curated glimpse you see on their Instagram or Facebook posts. 
 
As the saying goes, comparison really can be the thief of joy. Detoxing from your social connections can be a good way to focus on what’s important in your own life without comparing yourself to others. 
 
Fear of missing out, known as FOMO, is the fear that you are missing the experiences that everyone else is having. Constant connectivity can feed this fear. Every time you see a curated image or post about someone else’s life, it can leave you feeling as if your life is less exciting than theirs. You might find yourself overcommitting to social events out of the fear that you’ll be left behind.
 
FOMO can also keep you constantly checking your device out of fear that you are going to miss an important text, DM, or post. 
 
Doing a digital detox is one way to set limits and reduce your fear of missing out. The key is to do it in a way that doesn’t leave you feeling cut off from what’s happening in your digital world.
 
Some might suggest that a true digital detox would involve predefined abstinence from any and all digital devices and social media connections, but it is important to make your device usage work for your own life and demands. 
 
Detaching from your devices can benefit your mental well-being, but doing a digital detox does not have to involve a complete separation from your phone and other tech connections. The process is often more about setting boundaries and making sure that you are using your devices in a way that benefit, rather than harm, your emotional and physical health.
 
If you can do a complete digital detox for a certain amount of time, it might be something you want to try. Being completely disconnected can feel liberating and refreshing for some people. For a lot of people, completely forgoing all forms of digital communication might not be possible, particularly if you really do rely on staying connected for work, school, or other obligations. 
 
This doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the benefits of a digital detox; the key is to make disconnecting something that works for your schedule and your life. 
 
If you need your devices during the day for your job, try doing a mini-detox at the end of the workday. Pick a time when you want to turn off your devices, and then focus on spending an evening completely free of things like social media, texting, online videos, and other electronic distractions. 
 
While it isn’t always possible or even preferable to completely disconnect, setting limits on when these digital connections are allowed to intrude on your time can be good for your mental well-being. 
 
For example, you might want to use your phone to play your Spotify or Apple Music playlist while you are working out, but setting it to airplane mode will make sure that you aren’t distracted by phone calls, texts, other messages, or app notifications during your workout. 
 
Setting boundaries on the type and timing of connections you’ll attend to helps ensure that you can enjoy real-world activities completely free of digital diversions. 
 
Other times when you might want to limit your digital device usage include:
 Research suggests that limiting your social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day can significantly improve well-being, decreasing symptoms of loneliness and depression. 
Restricting your mobile device usage immediately before you go to sleep may also be helpful. One review of the research found that using media devices was linked to poor sleep quality, inadequate sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Skip laying in bed playing on your phone and instead try reading a book or magazine for a few minutes before you go to sleep.
 
Another way to start your digital detox is to turn off push notifications on your phone. Many social media apps including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and news websites send alerts every single time you get a message, mention, or new post.
 
Rather than checking certain apps or websites every time a new story or post hits, set aside a specific time each day when you’ll check your messages or mentions. Then set aside a certain amount of time, around 20 or 30 minutes, to devote to catching up and sending responses.
 You might find that it's helpful to leave your phone behind for at least a brief time. Studies have found that the mere presence of a mobile device, even if you aren’t actively using it, lowers empathy levels and decreased conversation quality when interacting with other people, a phenomenon researchers have dubbed ‘the iPhone effect.’ 
So the next time you are having dinner with a group of friends, try leaving your phone at home.
 
A digital detox can be whatever you want it to be and can take many forms. You might want to try giving up all digital devices for a time, including television, mobile phones, and social media. In other cases, you might want to focus on restricting your use of just one type of digital device such as your phone or your gaming console.
 
Some ideas that you might consider trying:
 
Some people find giving up their devices fairly easy. Others will find it much more difficult and even anxiety-provoking at times.
 
There are some things that you can do to ensure that your digital detox is more successful:
 
Going device-free can be uncomfortable and stressful at times. You might feel annoyed, anxious, and even bored without your mobile phone and other tech tools. While it may be hard, it can be a rewarding experience that will help you better understand your relationship with your devices. 
 You feel anxious or stressed out if you can't find your phone You feel compelled to check your phone every few minutes You feel depressed, anxious, or angry after spending time on social media You are preoccupied with the like, comment, or reshare counts on your social posts You’re afraid that you'll miss something if you don't keep checking your device You often find yourself staying up late or getting up early to play on your phone You have trouble concentrating on one thing without having to check your phone When you are eating meals, particularly when dining with other people When you are waking up or going to bed When you are working on a project or hobby When you are spending time with friends or family Before you go to sleep each night A digital fast: Try giving up all digital devices for a short period of time, such as a day or up to a week Recurrent digital abstinence: Pick one day of the week to go device-free A specific detox: If one app, site, game, or digital tool is

There are many ways to work on self-development and self-improvement, but setting specific goals for personal growth can ensure success. When life serves up obstacles, as it so often does, having a goal that you revisit frequently helps you reset, recommit, and recharge.
 
It also gives you the motivation and accountability to stay focused and follow through on your plans. Setting goals can sometimes feel like a daunting task. That’s why it’s helpful to have a roadmap to guide you along the way. 
 
Like most theories in psychology, goal-setting theory started with the ideas from Dr. Edwin A. Locke, in his article, Toward a Theory of Task Motivation and Incentives. In it, he explained the need for clear and specific goals that are challenging and monitored with regular feedback and progress. 
 
Locke, along with Dr. Gary Latham, came up with five principles of effective goal setting. These principles, which include clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback, and task complexity, are the necessary components when setting, working towards, and achieving a goal. 
 
Additionally, research done by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews points to the correlation between writing down your goals and successes rather than merely formulating and keeping them in your head. 
 
If you’ve ever set a goal and quit before seeing any results, then you know all too well that it takes more than willpower to make a change. Setting and achieving goals says licensed psychologist Catherine Jackson, requires motivation, thinking through the plan, and ways to navigate the possible challenges that may arise. 
 
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), research shows there are three factors to achieving goals:
 
All three of these have a place within SMART goals.
 
When you make your goal specific, you set yourself up for success. Consider answering who, what, where, when, which and why when getting specific about your goal. 
 
What benchmarks will you use to make sure you are moving forward? How will you know if you’re successful? How will you know if you need to make adjustments? Having a goal that you can measure will help you stay on track and reach your target dates. 
 
Is the goal you’re setting one you can reach? While you don’t want things to be easy, you also want to avoid setting goals that are out of your reach. 
 
This goes along with attainable. Is your goal relevant to your life, and can you realistically achieve it, based on your current circumstances? This may be a goal you’ve set before and did not achieve because it was not realistic at the time. But now, under different circumstances, this goal may now be realistic. 
 
For a goal to be realistic it also has to be grounded within a time frame, and it needs to be real or tangible. 
 Developing SMART goals is critical to success. That said, they often limit you to the “what” and the “how” of your goals. For your goals to be effective, you also need to find your purpose or the “why” of what drives your motivation.  
You can set goals in any part of your life. Some of the more common areas include health, career, financial, and education. These broader categories set the stage for the smaller goals you will work on yearly, monthly, and daily. 
 
While some of your goals may land within those categories, it’s important to recognize that self-development goals also encompass things like learning to paint, learning to golf, and giving back to your community. You don’t have to limit yourself to the most obvious parts of your life. 
 
Take some time to think about your passions and interests. Brainstorm some ideas around things that excite you. Think back and try to identify if there’s something you’ve always wanted to do, but fear of the unknown—or fear of failure—prevented you from taking a risk. The ideas you generate from these brainstorming activities are like clues that can help you narrow your focus and set more specific goals. 
 
The next step you’ll want to take is to ask yourself “why” that goal is important to you. For example, if you want to finish your college degree, setting smaller goals that revolve around “why” will help you get there faster. To define your why, consider asking yourself these three questions:
 
Once you have a better idea of your ""why,"" it’s time to do one more self-assessment. Going with the college degree example, if you’ve determined that finishing your degree is the big goal, then, before you apply the SMART strategy to come up with smaller, more obtainable goals, it’s helpful to answer the following questions to determine if you’re truly ready to make this commitment. 
 
Now that you’ve done two different activities to get clear on your reasons, it should be obvious if you’re motivated to create change. If that’s the case, you’re ready to move forward with the goal-setting process. 
 
Setting and working towards a goal requires more than just a piece of paper and pencil. There are also certain skills you need to have in place when taking on a goal. 
 
Fist and foremost, you need to be able to plan out the steps for reaching your goal. And once the plan is in place, it’s the commitment and focus that helps to move you towards the result you want. But, of course, somewhere in the middle, lies self-motivation and flexibility. Here are some other tips and strategies to help you reach your goals. 
 
When setting a goal, try to avoid the temptation to state your desire in a negative way. For example, “I will not complain so much.” Restated positively sounds more like this, “I will find three positive things about my day and write them down before I go to bed.”
 
This is one of the most difficult parts of setting and achieving goals. Because of the very nature of a goal, you start with the end in mind. But it’s really the steps you take to get there that matter the most. Let’s say the outcome you want is to lose 20 pounds. That’s the goal. But during the process of working towards this goal, you discover that your body is more comfortable at a weight that only has you losing 15 pounds. Did you fail at achieving this goal? Not if you believe in the power of the process. 
 
Once you’re ready to go, whether that’s in the preparation or action stage, Jackson recommends making a contract with yourself for success. 
 
Jackson says to get started on the right foot, it’s a good idea to reflect on what you’ve accomplished thus far and forgive yourself and let go of regret for what didn’t come to pass. While working on clearing the clutter from your mind, it’s not a bad idea to do the same with your home and workspaces. 
 
 “Visualization and mental workouts stimulate many of the same neural networks that connect the brain’s intentions to the body, so, take some time to properly train your thoughts before you begin setting your goals,” says Jackson. This helps you purposefully and intentionally imagine your goals coming to fruition.
 
 List out your goal or goals and the steps you need to accomplish them. Then, Jackson says to break these into small attainable steps with realistic deadlines. “This is easier when you set aside time before the start of each week to write out specific things you want to accomplish within the following week that will move you closer to the goal,” she explains. 
 
 It’s a good idea to put your goals with the steps and deadlines in a place where you can see it often. “Seeing the goals and steps you have to take will keep you motivated and consistent to continue to work toward it,” explains Jackson. Her advice? Look at it weekly or better yet daily.
 
As you accomplish steps toward your goal, make sure to reward yourself along the way.
 
One last thing before you get busy setting your goals, unless you are the exception to the rule, plan on reviewing and reassessing your goals several times before you reach them, especially if they are loftier goals.
 
You can set this up as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly date. It really depends on the benchmarks you set and how long you’ve given yourself to meet your goal.
 
Regardless of how often you sit down to do this review, the most important thing is that you assess whether your goals—and the steps you’re taking—are still relevant and realistic. 
 
This “date with your goals” also gives you the chance to monitor your progress, which the AAP equates with a greater likelihood that you will succeed. Not to mention, these review sessions give you a chance to make adjustments and celebrate any successes you’ve achieved, which are both critical in this process. 
 Motivation to change Willingness to monitor the behavior Willpower to make it happen Why is finishing my degree important to me? Why does that reason matter? Why do I feel strongly about that reason? Are you emotionally ready to commit to something that might be physically and or emotionally uncomfortable? Are you ready to be honest with yourself about where you’re at and where you want to go? Do you have the time? Can you say “no” to the things that will interfere with your goal?",many ways work self development self improvement set specific goals personal growth ensure success life serve obstacles often goal

Self-control is the ability to regulate and alter your responses in order to avoid undesirable behaviors, increase desirable ones, and achieve long-term goals. Research has shown that possessing self-control can be important for health and well-being.﻿﻿
 
Common goals such as losing weight, exercising regularly, eating healthy, not procrastinating, giving up bad habits, and saving money are just a few worthwhile ambitions that people believe require self-control.
 
People use a variety of terms for self-control, including discipline, determination, grit, willpower, and fortitude.
 
Psychologists typically define self-control as:﻿﻿
 
Still, some researchers believe that self-control is partly determined by genetics, with some just born better at it than others.﻿﻿
 
How important is self-control in your day-to-day life? A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 27% of respondents identified a lack of willpower as the primary factor keeping them from reaching their goals.
 
Whether your goal is to lose weight, earn a college degree, or quit smoking, it is easy to believe that achieving a goal is simply a matter of controlling your behaviors. The majority of people surveyed believe that self-control can be both learned and strengthened. Researchers have also identified a number of different factors and strategies that can help people improve their self-control.
 Researchers have found that people who have better self-control tend to be healthier and happier. 
In one experiment, students who exhibited greater self-discipline had better grades, higher test scores, and were more likely to be admitted to a competitive academic program. The study also found that when it came to academic success, self-control was a more important factor than IQ scores.﻿﻿
 
The benefits of self-control are not limited to academic performance. One long-term health study found that people who were rated as having high levels of self-control during childhood continued to have high levels of physical and mental health in adulthood.
 
The ability to delay gratification, or to wait to get what you want, is an important part of self-control. People are often able to control their behavior by delaying the gratification of their urges.﻿﻿ For instance, a person following a specific diet might try to avoid the temptations of indulging in unhealthy foods. As a result, they may delay their gratification and wait until they are able to enjoy an occasional treat.
 
Delaying gratification involves putting off short-term desires in favor of long-term rewards. Researchers have found that the ability to delay gratification is important not only for attaining goals but also plays an important part in well-being and overall success in life.
 
The psychologist Walter Mischel conducted a series of famous experiments during the 1970s that investigated the importance of delayed gratification.﻿﻿ In these experiments, children were offered a choice: They could choose to eat one treat right away (usually a cookie or a marshmallow) or they could wait a brief period of time in order to get two snacks.
 
At this point, the researcher would leave the child alone in a room with a single treat. Not surprisingly, many of the kids chose to eat the single treat the moment the experimenters left the room. However, some of the kids were able to wait for the second treat.
 Researchers found that children who were able to delay gratification in order to receive a greater reward were also more likely to have better academic performance than the kids who gave in to temptation immediately. 
Based on his research, Mischel proposed what he referred to as a ""hot-and-cool"" system to explain the ability to delay gratification. The hot system refers to the part of our willpower that is emotional, impulsive, and urges us to act upon our desires. When this system takes over, we may give in to our momentary desires and act rashly without considering the potential long-term effects.﻿﻿
 
The cool system is the part of our willpower that is rational, thoughtful, and enables us to consider the consequences of our actions in order to resist our impulses. The cool system helps us look for ways to distract us from our urges and find more appropriate ways to deal with our desires.
 
Research has found that self-control is a limited resource. In the long-term, exercising self-control tends to strengthen it. Practicing self-control allows you to improve it over time.﻿﻿ However, self-control in the short-term is limited. Focusing all of your self-control on one thing makes it more difficult to exercise your self-control on subsequent tasks throughout your day.
 
Psychologists refer to this tendency as ego depletion. This happens when people use up their reservoir of willpower on one task, making them unable to muster any self-control to complete the next task.
 
Self-control is also important for maintaining healthy behaviors. What you eat for breakfast, how often you work out, and whether you go to the doctor regularly are all decisions that are impacted by your levels of self-control and have the potential to affect your health.
 
Researchers have found that self-control can have a number of potential influences on health and well-being:
 While it is clear that self-control is critical for maintaining healthy behaviors, some experts believe that overemphasizing the importance of willpower can be damaging. 
The belief that self-control alone can help us reach our goals can lead to people to blame themselves when they are unable to resist temptation. It may also lead to feelings of learned helplessness where people feel that they cannot do anything to change a situation. As a result, people may give up quickly or simply stop trying in the face of obstacles.
 
According to psychologist and researcher Roy Baumeister, lack of willpower is not the only factor that affects goal attainment. If you are working toward a goal, three critical components must be present:﻿﻿
 
While research suggests self-control has its limitations, psychologists have also found that it can be strengthened with certain strategies.﻿﻿
 
This is an effective way of making the most of your available self-control. Avoiding temptation ensures that you do not ""use up"" your available self-control before it is really needed.
 Whether it's the desire to eat, drink, spend, or indulge in some other undesired behavior, one way to avoid temptation is to find a healthy distraction. 
Go for a walk, call a friend, throw in a load of laundry, or do whatever it takes to get your mind off the thing that is tempting you at the moment.
 
Consider possible situations that might break your resolve. If you are faced with temptation, what actions will you take to avoid giving in? Research has found that planning ahead can improve willpower even in situations where people have experienced the effects of ego depletion.
 
For example, if you know you have a hard time controlling those late afternoon snack attacks, eat a well-balanced lunch packed with plenty of fiber, protein, and whole grains that will keep you full longer.
 
While your control might become depleted in the short-term, regularly engaging in behaviors that require you to exert self-control will improve your willpower over time. Think of self-control as a muscle. While hard work may exhaust the muscle in the short-term, the muscle will grow stronger over time as you continue to work it.
 The classic games ""red light, green light"" or ""freeze dance"" can help children practice self-control from an early age. 
Setting a lot of goals at once (such as making a list of New Year's resolutions) is usually an ineffective approach. Depleting your willpower in one area can reduce self-control in other areas. It is best to choose one specific goal and focus your energy on it.
 
Once you turn the behaviors needed to reach a goal into habits, you will not need to devote as much effort toward maintaining them. You can then use your resources to achieve other goals.
 
Meditation is a great way to strengthen your self-control muscle. If you're new to meditation, mindfulness meditation is a great place to start learning how to be more self-aware so you can better resist temptations. This technique can also help you learn to slow your thoughts, which can help you control any gut impulses getting in the way of your self-control.
 
Just like self-control can help you achieve your goals and improve your physical and mental health, a lack of self-control can have adverse effects to your self-esteem, education, career, finances, relationships, and overall health and well-being. Reminding yourself of these consequences can help you stay motivated as you work to control your self-control.
 
Self-control is an important skill that allows us to regulate behavior in order to achieve our long-term goals. Research has shown that self-control is not only important for goal attainment. While self-control is a limited resource, research also suggests that there are things that you can do to improve and strengthen your willpower over time.
 The ability to control behaviors in order to avoid temptations and to achieve goals The ability to delay gratification and resist unwanted behaviors or urges A limited resource that can be depleted In one study, children who had higher levels of self-control were less likely to become overweight during adolescence.﻿﻿ Another study found that participants who had depleted their willpower on an unrelated task were more likely to give in to temptation when later presented with a treat.﻿﻿ Studies have also shown that kids who struggle with self-control during childhood are also more likely to use drugs and alcohol in high school.﻿﻿ There needs to be a clear goal and the motivation to change. Having an unclear or overly general goal (such as losing weight) and insufficient motivation can lead to failure. You are more likely to achieve a clearly defined goal (like losing 10 pounds) with a specific motivation. You need to track your actions toward the achievement of the goal. Simply setting the goal is not enough. You need to monitor your behavior each day to ensure that you are doing the things that need to be done in order to reach your goal. You need to have willpower. Being able to control your behavior is a critical part of achieving any goal. Fortunately, research suggests that there are steps people can take in order to make the most of their available willpower.",self control ability regulate alter responses order avoid undesirable

The phrase “psychological well-being” is used to describe an individual’s emotional health and overall functioning. The author of a study published in Applied Psychology: Health and Well‒Being describes psychological well-being as “the combination of feeling good and functioning effectively.”﻿﻿
 
Researchers also have found that the absence of distress doesn’t necessarily indicate a person has high psychological well-being. High psychological well-being is about feeling happy and doing well. People with high psychological well-being report feeling capable, happy, well-supported, and satisfied with life.
 
Studies have discovered that people with higher psychological well-being are more likely to live healthier and longer lives. They are also more likely to enjoy a better quality of life.﻿﻿ Better psychological well-being also is associated with fewer social problems.
 
For instance, research has found that people with high psychological well-being are less likely to engage in criminal activity or abuse drugs and alcohol. In addition, positive psychological well-being tends to predict higher earnings and more prosocial behavior, such as volunteering.
 People also are more likely to enjoy positive psychological well-being when they have their basic needs met. Living in a safe area, having enough food, and having adequate shelter are all important factors for emotional health. 
If you’re looking to improve your psychological well-being, there are several things you can do to feel and function better. Here's an overview of four things you an do to improve your overall sense of well-being.
 
Living a life with meaning and purpose is key to improving your psychological well-being.﻿﻿ Your purpose doesn’t necessarily have to involve changing the world or finding a career devoted to helping others though.
 
Instead, you might make it your purpose to be kind every day. Or, your purpose might involve making the world better by encouraging others to take care of the environment or adopt pets from the shelter. Maybe your purpose is being an advocate for those who are hurting like bullied students, the homeless, or victims of abuse.
 
If you feel like your life lacks purpose, don’t worry. There are many ways you can find purpose in life and build a life that has more meaning. Begin by thinking about the legacy you would like to leave behind. Write down how you’d like to be remembered at the end of your life, or think about the impact you want to leave on the planet. Then, establish some objectives that can help you reach those goals.
 Working toward your goals will give you a reason to get out of bed every day, beyond earning money. 
Thinking positively also improves your psychological well-being. In turn, as your psychological well-being improves, it becomes easier to think positively and feel good overall. Fortunately, you can begin creating that positive cycle with a few simple strategies. Here's an overview of the ways you can increase the positivity in your life.
 
Take a few minutes and write down all the good things that could happen to you in the future. Imagine how you could be spending your time and who you would be spending it with if you were living your best life.
 
You also may want to devise a plan on how you can make that happen. Make small, measurable goals that will help you achieve that better future. Then, put a plan into place. When you're working toward a better future—even if the steps are really small—it gives you a sense of purpose and something to look forward to.
 
Spend time thinking about some of the best memories of your life. Whether it's a family vacation you went on 10 years ago or an award you won at work two years ago, recalling the happiest times in your life can bring more positivity to your mindset.
 
Recognizing the good things that have happened to you over time—the people you have built memories with or the good times that you have experienced—is an important part of improving your well-being. They serve as reminders of the fullness life has to offer, especially when circumstances may be pulling you down.
 
Doing nice things for other people reminds you that you have the power to make a difference in the world. Giving to others also helps you think more positively and feel happier. Helping a neighbor in need, volunteering for a community activity, or raising money for a charity are just a few simple ways to improve your psychological well-being.
 
Also, look for ways to be kind to others in your everyday life. Doing so benefits you in a number of ways. In fact, researchers indicate that individual acts of kindness releases both endorphins and oxytocin—the feel good hormones—as well as creates new neural connections.﻿﻿ Consequently, kindness can become a self-reinforcing habit that takes less and less effort to perform. There's also some evidence linking kindness and healing.﻿﻿ So, look for ways to be kind to others and your body and mind will thank you.
 
Mindfulness, which means staying in the moment, has been linked to a multitude of benefits, ranging from increased happiness to better resilience.﻿﻿ Although mindfulness is a skill that takes practice and dedication, over time you can get better at learning how to be present and in the moment. Doing so has a number of benefits too.
 
For instance, studies suggest that mindfulness helps people manage stress, cope with serious illnesses, and reduce anxiety and depression. In fact, people who practice mindfulness are better able to relax, have improved self-esteem, and possess more enthusiasm over life.﻿﻿
 
What's more studies have found a link between mindfulness meditation and changes in the parts of the brain responsible for memory, learning, and emotion. This discovery is not surprising because mindfulness requires you to pay attention to your thoughts, your actions, and your body.﻿﻿
 
Whether you send letters to people telling them how much you appreciate them or you write about the things you feel thankful for in a journal, expressing your gratitude will keep you focused on all the good things in life. You can even express gratitude on social media.
 
Learning to be grateful in everything you do will become a way of life. You'll discover you can be thankful for little things like the beauty of sunset as well as the big things like a new job or a visit from friend. Finding things to be thankful for everyday is a simple but effective way to boost your psychological well-being.
 
Feeling capable and confident is important. One of the best ways to accomplish this task is to remind yourself of the things you’re good at or the character strengths you possess. Try reflecting on your past achievements and the qualities that helped you succeed.
 
Write down these things as a reminder of what you have to offer the world. And, if there's an area that you feel needs improvement, don't be afraid to list that too. Working on improving yourself is a great way to impact your overall well-being.
 
Letting go of past hurt and anger is key to good psychological well-being. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to allow that person to hurt you again. Instead, forgiveness is about releasing yourself of the anger that's holding you back and keeping you bound to that person.
 
Forgiving another person frees you to put your energy into more positive things rather than ruminating on past hurts and offenses. If the person who wounded you is still a threat to your overall well-being, it also may help to erect some boundaries to safeguard yourself from further unnecessary pain.
 
Studies show that loneliness takes a serious toll on your emotional and physical health.﻿﻿ In fact, one study found that being lonely was as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes per day.
 
Just being around people, however, isn’t the solution. Instead, it’s important to form deep connections with other people.
 The quality of relationships matters more than the quantity when it comes to improving your psychological well-being. 
While contact over social media can be a good way to keep in touch when you can’t visit a friend in person, there’s no real substitute for the benefits of face-to-face contact. Have coffee with a friend, eat dinner with your family, and call a loved one just to chat.
 
Strong social support also is important to staying psychologically healthy. If you lack a support system, take steps to meet more people. Join community activities, get acquainted with your neighbors, or reach out to old friends.
 
Psychological well-being is a key part of feeling happy and being able to function day-to-day. It's easier than you may think to develop healthy habits that can foster your emotional health. Start small and try practicing one or two strategies to maximize your psychological well-being, such as writing down a few of your strengths or happy memories. Over time, you will see the effects that these practices have on your positivity and overall mental health.

"
Are you on a quest to find happiness? While happiness might feel elusive or out of your reach at times, that doesn't make it an impossible journey or goal to achieve. On the contrary, happiness could be waiting for you around the next corner if you just hang on.
 
Or, it might be even simpler than that. Happiness might have been with you all along—you just may not have taken the time to realize it was much less complicated than you once believed. You probably know it's not about driving the newest car or having the latest gadget. But, what is it that really drives happiness? Let's consider four studies from around the world to answer that question.
 
A 2007 study reporting on data from the British Household Panel Survey revealed an interesting set of findings of the roots of happiness.
 
What is it that makes us happy: getting what we want or having what we want? Paradoxically, it seems that it's not the state of ""being married"" that makes us the happiest, but rather dynamic events such as ""starting a new relationship.""
 
In the same way, ""getting a new job"" had a greater effect on happiness than employment status. ""Becoming pregnant"" had a greater effect on happiness than ""being a parent."" Similarly, events such as ""starting a new course,"" ""passing an exam,"" or ""buying a new house"" were all also high on the happiness scale.
 
In contrast, events with a low relation to happiness included the end of a relationship, losing a job, and losing a parent. What does all this mean, and what is making people in Britain happy? Let's take a moment to figure this out.
 
Positive dynamic events seem to be key rather than static situations. While this may all sound a little superficial, it makes sense to some degree if you consider happiness to be a ""momentary"" state.
 
What can we glean from this study? If you want to pursue happiness in your life or stay positive, realize that there is always the possibility that some happy event is waiting around the corner for you. And if you don't feel like waiting—go out and make something happy happen. As the quote from Abraham Lincoln goes, ""The best way to predict your future is to create it.""
 
A 2008 study reported on data from the Framingham Heart Study conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts followed 4,739 people from 1983 to 2003 to answer one interesting question: does our happiness depend on the happiness levels of the people around us?
 
Startlingly, the results of the study showed that to be precisely the case.
 People who are surrounded by happy people are more likely to become happy in the future. 
What's more, the analysis revealed that this effect was the result of happiness spreading, not just an artifact of happy people tending to hang out with one another.
 
According to this study, if you have a friend who lives within a mile of you and that friend becomes happy, the odds of you also becoming happy increase by about 25 percent. The same was true for spouses (up to 16 percent improvement), siblings living within a mile (up to 28 percent), and next-door neighbors (up to 70 percent). Interestingly, the happiness of coworkers was shown to have no effect on the happiness of those around them.
 
What does all this mean? Surround yourself with happy people as much as possible, because it's very likely that their happiness will spread to you.
 
In an Australian study of over 300 young adults, it was shown that those who recalled memories about problem-solving (a time when you successfully managed a challenge) or about identity (something that shaped you to become the person you are today) showed decreased negative emotions and increased positive emotions, respectively.
 
These findings suggest that simply thinking back to a time in your life when you were overcoming a challenge or to a time when you went through a significant life experience that changed you for the better could be effective in boosting your mood, and therefore, your happiness.
 
A 2019 study out of South Korea using data from the Korean General Social Survey (KGSS) showed that respondents prioritizing spirituality were the most likely to be happy, followed by those who valued social relationships (friends, family, neighbors).
 People who placed the most weight on external achievements (money, education, work, leisure) were the least likely to be happy. 
These findings suggest that the path to happiness in South Korea is not about all that glitters with gold—rather, going after goals related to collectivism or self-transcendence may be most important to boosting and preserving happiness.
 
It's clear that what makes you happy may depend on where you live in the world (although these are limited studies that looked at different concepts). The British valued positive change, Americans grew happy when those around them were happy, Australians became happy when remembering positive memories, and South Koreans were happiest when engaged in collectivistic and spiritual pursuits.
 
The common thread, however, is that happiness is ever-changing and your happiness meter can always be boosted. If you truly want to pursue happiness, surround yourself with positivity and see beyond your present circumstances to the bigger picture, both in terms of people and your place in the greater universe.

Despite what your common sense may tell you, research shows that people are surprisingly inept at predicting how we will feel in various situations. For example, one study found that newlywed couples tended to estimate that their happiness levels would rise (or at least stay the same) over the four-year-period after marriage.﻿﻿ ﻿In reality, their levels of happiness tended to diminish over that time period.
 
Other studies have found that lottery winners' happiness levels tend to reduce to pre-winning days (or sometimes even below).﻿﻿ In fact, while we believe that the ideal job, perfect relationship, or stellar bank account will change our happiness levels permanently, they may only give us a temporary boost of joy—it is surprisingly short-lived. It seems that our expectations can confuse us into thinking that our goals will bring us much more than they actually do, so we often pursue the wrong goals.​
 
A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens novel, ""Great Expectations."" The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.
 
When he ultimately learned that the money was not necessarily part of that larger plan, he realized that he had taken for granted so many important relationships and gifts in his life. His expectations had robbed him of fully appreciating his reality.
 
Research backs up this idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience that other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth. ﻿﻿
 
This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savor our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts color our enjoyment of what we actually have.
 
How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savor what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?
 
Finally, our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealized versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.
 
Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realize this mismatched comparison.
 Our expectations for our lives may be unrealistic and skewed based on what we think others have. Our perspective of what others have is limited; they do not have the lives we perceive. 
This may be part of why those who spend more time on social media tend to be less happy.﻿﻿
 
It's important to take a deeper look into how your expectations stack up to reality (and how your mood is affected because of this). Here are some healthy ways to start.
 
If you'd like to get out of the expectations vs. reality trap, it all comes down to awareness. Becoming aware of what you are expecting is a great start. Becoming aware of what you ""should"" be expecting is also a wise idea.
 
When you find that what is happening is not what you expected, actively look for the positives in what you have. You may find that once you get over the disappointment, you have something you didn't initially realize you wanted. This helps you to be more appreciative of what you have.
 
When you see others' posts on social media and decide that you want what you see, remind yourself that this may not be reality. It's great to know what direction you want things to go in, but don't forget that what you see isn't necessarily what others are actually living.
 
You may be overestimating how happy you would be once you have what you think you want. For instance, if you work a job you hate to save enough to buy an expensive car or nice clothes, you may find that your happiness is not very long-lasting.
 Truly savor what you have. It's okay to want more, but you can enjoy life so much more if you appreciate what you already have. Savoring what you have is a great way to expand the joy you experience in life. 
Don't beat yourself up for feeling disappointment; however, try comparing yourself to others who have less, not more. Or better yet, try not to compare yourself to others in general. The only person you should be competing with is you.
 
Ultimately, striving for more can lead you to work your hardest and do your best. At the same time, it can also rob you of joy, especially when you expect things to come more easily than they do or in a different way. Becoming more aware of your expectations and how they change your feelings toward your own reality can free you from disappointment and stress that comes from unrealistic expectations.
 When you go into a new situation, ask yourself what you expect to happen.  Ask yourself if your expectations should be this way. Where did these expectations come from and are they realistic? When you feel disappointed, try to think about whether it was realistic to expect what you were hoping for. (If so, make a plan for getting what you want next time. If not, think about managing your expectations and how to do this.)",despite common sense may tell research show people surprisingly inept predict feel various situations example one study find newlywed couple tend estimate happiness level would rise least stay four year period marriage reality level happiness tend diminish time period study find lottery winners happiness level tend reduce pre win days sometimes even fact believe ideal job perfect relationship stellar bank account change happiness level permanently may give temporary boost joy surprisingly short live seem expectations confuse think goals bring much actually often pursue wrong goals problem expectations make famous charles dickens novel great expectations main character pip inherit money secret benefactor view fortune step stone marry girl dream ultimately learn money necessarily part larger plan realize take grant many important relationships gift life expectations rob fully appreciate reality research back idea may fully appreciate expect compare could one study find participants expose subliminal reminder wealth spend less time savor chocolate bar exhibit less enjoyment experience subject remind wealth interest study remind try savor chocolate live perhaps try remind study also remind however easy let thoughts color enjoyment actually many time focus much something want truly savor often might expectations great things make feel like really great many people less finally expectations get better expect realistic give situation might expect partner live see romance film job idealize versions children even live match see instagram expectations create significant stress match reality also consider social media greatly contribute compare worst moments deem shareable online others best moments often filter seem perfect may even realize mismatch comparison expectations live may unrealistic skew base think others perspective others limit live perceive may part spend time social media tend less happy important take deeper look expectations stack reality mood affect healthy ways start like get expectations reality trap come awareness become aware expect great start become aware expect also wise idea find happen expect actively look positives may find get disappointment something initially realize want help appreciative see others post social media decide want see remind may reality great know direction want things forget see necessarily others actually live may overestimate happy would think want instance work job hate save enough buy expensive car nice clothe may find happiness long last truly savor okay want enjoy life much appreciate already savor great way expand joy experience life beat feel disappointment however try compare others less better yet try compare others general person compete ultimately strive lead work hardest best time also rob joy especially expect things come easily different way become aware expectations change feel toward reality free disappointment stress come unrealistic expectations new situation ask expect happen ask expectations way expectations come realistic feel disappoint try think whether realistic expect hop make plan get want next time think manage expectations

Solitude often gets a bad rap. Experts extol the virtues of social connectivity; it's linked to better immunity, improved stress resilience, and even longer life. Being alone, on the other hand, is all too often equated with loneliness. Research suggests that social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of heart disease, obesity, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure, and even early death. 
 
But research is also increasingly showing that there are real benefits to finding things to do by yourself. Doing things by yourself allows you to enjoy activities you love at your own pace and in your own way. Through solitary pursuits, you learn more about yourself and reflect on your experiences.
 
While there is a wealth of research pointing to the psychological downsides of loneliness and social isolation, there is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that a certain amount of quality time alone is critical to well-being. Some things, this research suggests, are just better off being done by yourself without the distractions, opinions, or influences of other people.
 
Even though people sometimes fear seclusion, research has shown than many people actually seek and prefer solitude. Your desire for alone time is heavily influenced by your overall personality.
 
Your preferences for solitude play a role in determining whether being alone has a positive or negative effect on your well-being. Where extroverts often dislike being alone, introverts tend to prefer it. Of course, just because you tend to be introverted does not mean that you want to be alone all the time. Even the most introverted of people need a support network and social connections.
 
And being an extrovert does not mean that you aren’t capable of enjoying your own company. Even if you naturally seek the company of a crowd, you can learn how to enjoy a little time to yourself now and then.
 
It is important to remember that being alone and loneliness are two very different things. Loneliness involves being isolated despite wanting social connections, where being alone means taking time for yourself between regular social interactions.
 
Choosing to be alone at times can be rejuvenating, but the important variables are that it is something you choose and something you enjoy. Being alone is harmful if it feels like a punishment or if you feel excluded from social connections.
 
If you are naturally drawn to other people, finding activities to enjoy all on your own might seem difficult at first. Adding some quiet moments where you can be alone can come with a number of benefits, particularly if you are always on the go and struggle to slow down and take breaks.
 
Some things you might want to try:
 
Take yourself out to dinner. Dining out is often viewed as a social experience, but treating yourself to a nice meal can give you a chance to relax and enjoy the experience in peace.
 
Go to the movies alone. It’s not like you spend a lot of time socializing in the middle of a film, but being with other people means you might be distracted wondering what they think of the movie and what they might have to say later. Seeing a film alone means that you can fully focus on the story and visuals in front of you without wondering about what your companions might think.
 
See your favorite band or musician by yourself. Not only will you get to see your favorites without having to worry about finding people who want to go with you, seeing a concert alone can be a great way to meet other people who you share common interests with. You might be doing something on your own, but it can actually help widen your social circle.
 
Go for a hike. Spending time in nature can be great for your health, but it can sometimes be tough to find people who want to go. Going alone can give you a chance to connect with nature, challenge your body, and enjoy some peaceful solitude.
 
Previous research has shown that nature can have a number of psychological benefits, ranging from restoring attention to relieving stress.
 Researchers suggest that being alone in nature can help people focus their priorities, gain a greater appreciation for relationships, and improve future goal-setting.  
If you do hike alone, take all necessary safety precautions. While the point is to be by yourself, make sure someone knows where you will be, and you should always have the ability to contact the outside world if needed.
 
Travel. Vacationing and traveling alone may seem particularly intimidating, but it can also be an exciting and rewarding way to challenge yourself and learn new things. Traveling alone is also a great way to build self-sufficiency and confidence.
 
Learn something new. Sign up for a class where you can learn a new skill, whether it’s something like cooking, archery, art, dance, or some other hobby that has always interested you. Instead of being focused on doing what other people want to do, you can pursue something that satisfies your own interests.
 
Visit a museum. Rather than feeling rushed or pressured, wandering through a museum on your own is a great way to spend time looking at the exhibits that you’re interested in and skip the ones your not. It also means that you can check out things at your own pace and react to exhibits without wondering what other people are thinking.
 
Volunteer. Research has shown that prosocial actions like volunteering can have a number of positive benefits. Look for opportunities in your community where you can devote a little time to a cause you are passionate about.
 
Most research suggests that too much social isolation takes a serious toll on both physical and mental health. But there are benefits to spending time on your own, as long as you balance it by maintaining strong and supportive social connections. 
 
When you are working in a group, you might exert less effort to memorize information because you simply assume that others in the group will fill in the gaps, a phenomenon known as social loafing. Working on things alone can help you focus your attention, which can improve your retention and recall.
 In one study published in the journal Psychological Bulletin, researchers found that groups working collaboratively to recall information performed worse than individuals recalling things on their own. 
It gives you time to focus on your interests. Being alone is an important part of self-development. It allows you to get to know yourself. When you are surrounded by others, you might set your own ideas and passions aside in order to appease the wants and needs of friends and family. Taking time on your own gives you a critical opportunity to make creative choices and focus your attention without worrying about what other people are thinking.
 
Collaborative brainstorming is often seen as one of the best ways to generate new ideas, but research has found that people are often better at solving difficult problems when they work on their own. Where group efforts are often about achieving consensus and fitting in with the crowd, solo work encourages innovation without added social pressure.
 
Relationships are often strongest when each person takes time to take care of themselves. Even when it comes to friendships, the old adage may be true—a little absence might really make the heart grow fonder.
 One study published in the British Journal of Psychology found that highly intelligent people actually become less satisfied the more time they spend socializing with friends.  
Having friendships and a strong social support system is important for your mental health and well-being, but taking a break and going it solo once in a while may help you appreciate those connections all the more.
 
Group work is often lauded for improving collaboration and innovation, but it can also be distracting. Even trying to focus on more than one thing at a time has been shown to dramatically reduce overall productivity. So even if you don’t have the luxury of focusing on projects solo, you can reduce productivity killers by simply focusing on one task at a time.
 
Research suggests that a certain amount of alone-time can actually help you have greater empathy for the people around you. Of course, getting time alone isn’t always easy, particularly when technology has transformed how people spend time alone. Even when you are by yourself, you may never take a break from communicating with others. After all, they’re just a text, tweet, or DM away.
 
Even in cases where you are not able to get time completely by yourself, cutting back on digital communication for a brief time might be helpful. In one study, researchers found that when teens went five days without communication devices, they improved their ability to interpret emotions and facial expressions.
 Just be careful not to let periods of solitude turn into social isolation—research has found that loneliness is linked to decreased empathy. 
Being alone doesn’t come naturally to everyone. If you are used to surrounding yourself with friends and family or even prefer the company of strangers, learning to appreciate the joys of going solo may take some time.
 One fascinating study found that participants would rather engage in mundane tasks or even administer electrical shocks to themselves rather than spend 6 to 15 minutes alone in a room with nothing to do but think.  
In the study, participants much preferred to spend their time engaged in mundane tasks rather than being left to their own thoughts. The researchers concluded that most people would rather be doing something—even something negative—than sit and do nothing.
 
Of course, this doesn’t mean that you need to completely escape all forms of external stimulation when you are alone. The key is to engage in activities that allow you to feel a sense of inner solitude. Some people can achieve this feeling while listening to music or reading a book, while others might require the quiet of a peaceful session of meditation.
 
Find what works for you, then make sure that you have regular moments where you can retreat to this quiet mental space.
 
Whether you are an introvert who thrives on solitude or a gregarious extrovert who loves to socialize, a little high-quality time to yourself can be good for your overall well-being. The trick is to remember that this alone time is for focusing on you—for cultivating your passions, finding new inspirations, getting to know yourself better, or even engaging in some much-needed rest and relaxation. Even when you are busy, pencil in a little time each week for some moments of seclusion.
 It's voluntary You also maintain positive relationships You can return to social groups when desired You feel good about spending time alone Make a plan. The best alone-time often happens when you set aside a specific period to be by yourself. It shouldn’t be forced isolation that leaves you feeling withdrawn or anti-social. Set aside an evening or a weekend for a little refreshing “me time.” Eliminate the distractions. If you find yourself tempted to work, check out social media, or talk on the phone, start by turning off any potential distracting devices. Leave your laptop and phone aside and focus on doing something that you don’t normally get to do on your own. Learn to value solitude. In an ever-connected world that often devalues being alone, it is important to remember the importance of taking time to spend with just your own thoughts.",solitude often get bad rap experts extol

Learned optimism involves developing the ability to view the world from a positive point of view. It is often contrasted with learned helplessness. By challenging negative self-talk and replacing pessimistic thoughts with more positive ones, people can learn how to become more optimistic.
 
There are a number of benefits to becoming a more optimistic person. Some of the many advantages of optimism that researchers have discovered include:
 
In one study, children with risk factors for depression were placed in a training program where they were taught skills related to learned optimism.﻿﻿ The results of the study revealed that children with the risk factors were much more likely to show symptoms of moderate to severe depression at a two-year follow-up. However, those who had received training in learned optimism and anti-depression skills were half as likely to develop such symptoms of depression.
 
Pessimists tend to believe that bad things are simply bound to happen, that they are at fault, and that negative outcomes will be permanent. Optimists, on the other hand, expect that good things will happen to them. They tend to see setbacks as temporary events caused by circumstances. Rather than giving up or feeling helpless in the face of failure, optimists view it as a challenge that can be overcome or fixed.
 
Optimists and pessimists tend to differ in terms of explanatory style, or how they go about explaining the events that take place in their lives. Key differences in these explanatory styles tend to be centered on:
 Research has found that pessimists tend to be in the minority. Most people (estimates have ranged between 60 to 80 percent) tend to be optimists to varying degrees. 
Learned optimism is a concept that emerged out of the relatively young branch of psychology known as positive psychology. Learned optimism was introduced by psychologist Martin Seligman, who is considered the father of the positive psychology movement. According to Seligman, the process of learning to be optimistic is an important way to help people maximize their mental health and live better lives.
 
Seligman himself has suggested that his work initially focused on pessimism. As a clinical psychologist, he tended to look for problems and how to fix them. It wasn't until a friend pointed out that his work was truly about optimism that he truly began to focus on how to take what was good and make it even better.
 
Seligman's work early in his career was centered on what is known as learned helplessness, which involves giving up when you believe that nothing you do will make any difference.
 
Explanatory styles play a role in this learned helplessness. How people explain the things that happen to them, whether they view them as being caused by outside or internal forces, contributes to whether people experience this helplessness or not.
 
As a result of this paradigm shift, Seligman wrote a book focused on the psychology of learned optimism. His work helped inspire the rise of positive psychology. Seligman went on to become the president of the American Psychological Association, elected by the largest vote in the APA's history. His theme for the year centered on the subject of positive psychology.
 
Psychology was only half-formed, he believed. Where there was a solid body of research and practice on how to treat mental illness, trauma, and psychological suffering, the other side that focused on how to be happy and how to live a good life, was only in its infancy. He believed that if people could learn how to become optimistic, they could lead to healthier and happier lives.
 
While it may be clear that optimism can be beneficial, it then becomes a question of whether or not people can learn to take a more positive perspective. Can even the most pessimistic of people adjust their worldview?
 
Researchers suggest that in addition to being partially hereditary, optimism levels are also influenced by childhood experiences, including parental warmth and financial stability.﻿﻿
 
Seligman's work, however, suggests that it's possible to learn the skills that can help you become a more optimistic person. Anyone can learn these skills, no matter how pessimistic they are, to begin with.
 
Seligman's research suggests that it may be beneficial to teach kids optimism skills late enough in childhood so that kids have the metacognitive skills to think about their own thoughts, but prior to the onset of puberty. Teaching such skills during this critical period might be the key to helping kids ward off a number of psychological maladies, including depression.
 
Seligman believes that anyone can learn how to become more optimistic. He developed a learned optimism test designed to help people discover how optimistic they are. People who start out more optimistic can further improve their own emotional health, while those who are more pessimistic can benefit by lowering their chances of experiencing symptoms of depression.
 
Seligman's approach to learning optimism is based upon the cognitive-behavioral techniques developed by Aaron Beck and the rational emotive behavioral therapy created by Albert Ellis. Both approaches are focused on identifying the underlying thoughts that influence behaviors and then actively challenging such beliefs.
 
Seligman's approach is known as the ""ABCDE"" model of learned optimism:
 
To use this model to learn to be more optimistic:
 
Think about a recent sort of adversity you have faced. It might be something related to your health, your family, your relationships, your job, or any other sort of challenge you might experience.
 
For example, imagine that you recently started a new exercise plan but you are having trouble sticking with it.
 
Make a note of the type of thoughts that are running through your mind when you think about this adversity. Be as honest as you can and do not try to sugarcoat or edit your feelings.
 
In the previous example, you might think things such as ""I'm no good at following my workout plan,"" ""I'll never be able to reach my goals,"" or ""Maybe I'm not strong enough to reach my goals.""
 
Consider what sort of consequences and behaviors emerged from the beliefs you recorded in step 2. Did such beliefs result in positive actions, or did they keep you from reaching your goals?
 
In our example, you might quickly realize that the negative beliefs you expressed made it more difficult to stick with your workout plan. Perhaps you started skipping workouts more or put in less of an effort when you went to the gym.
 
Dispute your beliefs. Think about your beliefs from step 2 and look for examples that prove those beliefs wrong. Look for any example that challenges your assumptions.
 
For example, you might consider all of the times that you did successfully finish your workout. Or even other times that you have set a goal, worked towards it and finally reached it.
 
Consider how you feel now that you have challenged your beliefs. How did disputing your earlier beliefs make you feel?
 
After thinking of times you have worked hard toward your goal, you may be left feeling more energized and motivated. Now that you have seen that it isn't as hopeless as you previously believed, you may be more inspired to keep working on your goals.
 Remember, this is an ongoing process that you may need to repeat often. When you find yourself facing a challenge, make an effort to follow these steps. Eventually, you will find it easier to identify pessimistic beliefs and to challenge your negative thoughts. This process may also eventually help you replace your negative thoughts and approach challenges with greater optimism. 
Some critics have argued that some learned optimism training programs are less about teaching people to become more optimistic and more about reducing pessimism. Other researchers believe that explanatory styles may actually have less to do with optimism than previously believed.
 
Other research has also suggested that optimism might also have a negative side. People who are overly and perhaps unrealistically optimistic may be prone to narcissism.﻿﻿ Having an optimism bias can also lead people to take healthy risks and engage in risky behaviors because they underestimate their own level of danger.
 
While some research has pointed to potential pitfalls of being overly or unrealistically optimistic, most studies have supported the idea that there is a positive connection between optimism and overall health. Optimism, for example, is a predictor for better physical health as people grow older.
 
Perhaps the most encouraging thing about optimism is that it involves skills that can be learned and put into practice. Ultimately, learned optimism is about more than just improving your well-being or warding off psychological ailments such as depression or low self-esteem. Seligman suggests that it can also be a route to finding your purpose in life. ""Optimism is invaluable for a meaningful life. With a firm belief in a positive future you can throw yourself into the service of that which is larger than you are,"" he explains.
 Better health outcomes: A meta-analysis of 83 studies found that optimism played a significant role in health outcomes for cardiovascular disease, cancer, pain, physical symptoms and mortality.﻿﻿ Longer lifespan: Studies have shown that optimistic people tend to live longer than pessimists.﻿﻿ Lower stress levels: Optimists not only experience less stress, but they also cope with it better. They tend to be more resilient and recover from setbacks more quickly Rather than becoming overwhelmed and discouraged by negative events, they focus on making positive changes that will improve their lives.﻿﻿ Higher motivation: Becoming more optimistic can also help you maintain motivation when pursuing goals. When trying to lose weight, for example, pessimists might give up because they believe diets never work. Optimists, on the other hand, are more likely to focus on positive changes they can make that will help them reach their goals. Better mental health: Optimists report higher levels of well-being than pessimists. Research also suggests that teaching learned optimism techniques can significantly reduce depression. Personalization: When things go wrong, optimists tend to lay the blame on external forces or circumstances. Pessimists, on the other hand, are more likely to blame themselves for the unfortunate events in their lives. At the same time, optimists tend to view good events as being a result of their own efforts, while pessimists link good outcomes to external influences. Permanence: Optimists tend to view bad times as temporary. Because of this, they also tend to be better able to bounce back after failures or setbacks. Pessimists are more likely to see negative events as permanent and unchangeable. This is why they are often more likely to give up when things get tough. Pervasiveness: When optimists experience failure in one area, they do not let it influence their beliefs about their abilities in other areas. Pessimists, however, view setbacks as more pervasive. In other words, if they fail at one thing, they believe they will fail at everything.

When it comes to personal development, our culture often celebrates those who are self-assured or self-confident. But new research suggests that self-compassion might be a better way to approach success and personal development. For instance, self-confidence makes you feel better about your abilities, while self-compassion encourages you to acknowledge your flaws and limitations. And once you acknowledge and accept your flaws, you are more likely to view them objectively and realistically. This, in turn, can lead to positive changes in your life.
 
Drawn from Buddhist psychology, self-compassion is not the same as self-esteem or self-confidence. Instead of a way of thinking about yourself, it is a way of being or a way of treating yourself. In fact, according to Dr. Kristin Neff, a psychology professor at the University of Texas, self-compassion involves treating yourself just like you would treat your friends or family members even when they fail or screw up. In general, self-compassion involves accepting that you are human and that you make mistakes. It also means you do not dwell on those mistakes or beat yourself up for making them.
 
Dr. Neff was the first person to measure and define self-compassion and offers a number of meditations that can be used to improve your self-compassion skills. For instance, she also offers several self-compassion exercises you can engage in including affectionate breathing and loving-kindness meditation.
 
When it comes to practicing self-compassion, there are several primary components that are essential to its success. These include being kind to yourself, just like you would be to a friend; being mindful of who you really are, flaws and all; and, allowing yourself the freedom to be imperfect. Here is an overview of the primary components of self-compassion.
 
When you practice self-kindness, you recognize that all people are imperfect and that all people have imperfect lives. And you are kind to yourself when things go wrong instead of being critical. For instance, when something goes wrong, Dr. Neff says your first reaction might be to think ""this should not be happening."" Or, you might think: ""I shouldn't have this issue come up in my life. Everyone else is living perfectly happy, normal lives.""
 With negative or unkind thinking, you are likely to experience additional suffering because it makes you feel isolated, alone and different from everyone else. 
But with self-kindness, instead of thinking ""poor me,"" you think ""well everyone fails once in a while."" You acknowledge that everyone has issues and struggles because this is what it means to be human. When you start to think like that, it changes the way you view life's challenges and difficulties. That opens the door for you to grow from the experience. But if you feel like it's abnormal or that it shouldn't be happening, then you start to engage in self-blame.
 
Another component of self-compassion is mindfulness. When you are mindful, you have to be willing to face your pain and suffering and acknowledge it. Most people do not want to do that. In fact, they usually want to avoid it. They want to avoid the pain and go straight to problem-solving. But when life throws you a curveball, it is important that you take the time to be mindful of how those struggles or failures make you feel and why they might have happened. When you are able to do that, you are much more likely to grow and learn from the situation.
 
Another thing you need to be mindful of is your inner critic. Self-criticism can be very defeating and often plays on repeat in our minds. But mindfulness allows you to be aware of your shortcomings without passing judgment on yourself. The result is that you will recognize where you need improvement without the pressure of being superhuman.
 
Once you can accept that it is unrealistic to expect perfection, it will feel like a huge weight has been lifted from your shoulders. It also helps you to realize that what you are experiencing is normal and human, and you should not feel bad about it. Additionally, recognizing your imperfections can also help you feel more connected to others because you realize that everyone experiences hardships and difficulties.
 
Remember, self-compassion is about being kind to yourself and realizing that humans are imperfect, including you. This also requires acknowledging that it is okay to not be perfect. Your flaws and setbacks should help you understand yourself better, not make you stressed out or feel bad about who you are.
 
Overall, self-compassion involves recognizing the difference between making a bad choice and being a bad person. When you practice self-compassion, you understand that making bad decisions does not automatically make you a bad person. Instead, you recognize that your value and worth is unconditional. In fact, research has consistently shown a positive connection between self-compassion and overall well-being. Additionally, self-compassion provides a sense of self-worth. But not in a narcissistic way like self-confidence can at times.
 
What's more, people who practice self-compassion also have more social connections, higher emotional intelligence, and greater overall satisfaction with life. They also are more caring, supportive and empathetic.
 
Meanwhile, research shows that people are self-compassionate have less anxiety, depression, and fear of failure. Research also shows that self-compassion can be a motivator causing people to improve on their mistakes, failures or shortcomings because they view them more objectively.
 
When it comes to being self-compassionate, the first thing you need to address is that voice in your head that is constantly critiquing you. Many times, that voice is way too critical. For example, you may beat yourself up for every little mistake. To be more self-compassionate, you need to recognize that voice and correct it when it veers off course. That doesn't mean you tell yourself how great you are. Instead, you talk to yourself in a kind, nonjudgmental way—the same way you would encourage a loved one. And when you do, life will get a whole lot more manageable.

Forgiveness is often defined as a deliberate decision to let go of feelings of anger, resentment, and retribution toward someone who you believe has wronged you. However, while you may be quite generous in your ability to forgive others, you may be much harder on yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, but learning how to learn from these errors, let go, move on, and forgive yourself is important for mental health and well-being.﻿﻿
 
Learn more about why self-forgiveness can be beneficial and explore some steps that may help you become better at forgiving your own mistakes.
 
Self-forgiveness is not about letting yourself off the hook nor is it a sign of weakness. The act of forgiveness, whether you are forgiving yourself or someone who has wronged you, does not suggest that you are condoning the behavior. It means that you accept the behavior, you accept what has happened, and you are willing to move past it and move on with your life without ruminating over past events that cannot be changed.﻿﻿
 
One therapeutic approach to self-forgiveness suggests that four key actions can be helpful.﻿﻿
 
Forgiving yourself is about more than just putting the past behind you and moving on. It is about accepting what has happened and showing compassion to yourself.﻿﻿
 
Facing what you have done or what has happened is the first step toward self-forgiveness. It's also the hardest step. If you have been making excuses, rationalizing, or justifying your actions in order to make them seem acceptable, it is time to face up and accept what you have done.
 
By taking responsibility and accepting that you have engaged in actions that have hurt others, you can avoid negative emotions, such as excessive regret and guilt.
 
As a result of taking responsibility, you may experience a range of negative feelings, including guilt and shame. When you've done something wrong, it's completely normal, even healthy, to feel guilty about it. These feelings of guilt and remorse can serve as a springboard to positive behavior change.﻿﻿
 
While guilt implies that you're a good person who did something bad, shame makes you see yourself as a bad person. This can bring up feelings of worthlessness which, left unresolved, can lead to addiction, depression, and aggression.﻿﻿
 
Understand that making mistakes that you feel guilty about does not make you a bad person or undermine your intrinsic value.
 
Making amends is an important part of forgiveness, even when the person you are forgiving is yourself. Just as you might not forgive someone else until they've made it up to you in some way, forgiving yourself is more likely to stick when you feel like you've earned it.
 
One way to move past your guilt is to take action to rectify your mistakes.﻿﻿ Apologize if it is called for and look for ways that you can make it up to whomever you have hurt.
 
It may seem as if this portion of the process benefits only the person you've harmed, but there's something in it for you as well. Fixing your mistake means you'll never have to wonder if you could have done more.
 
Everyone makes mistakes and has things for which they feel sorry or regretful. Falling into the trap of rumination, self-hatred, or even pity can be damaging and make it difficult to maintain your self-esteem and motivation.
 
Forgiving yourself often requires finding a way to learn from the experience and grow as a person.﻿﻿ To do this, you need to understand why you behaved the way you did and why you feel guilty. What steps can you take to prevent the same behaviors again in the future? Yes, you might have messed up, but it was a learning experience that can help you make better choices in the future.
 
While self-forgiveness is a powerful practice, it's important to recognize that this model is not intended for people who unfairly blame themselves for something they aren't responsible for.
 
People who have suffered abuse, trauma, or loss, for example, may feel shame and guilt even though they had no control.﻿﻿ This can be particularly true when people feel they should have been able to predict, and therefore avoid, a negative outcome (an example of what is known as the hindsight bias).﻿﻿
 
The standard axiom within psychology has been that forgiveness is a good thing and that it conveys a number of benefits, whether you have experienced a minor slight or have suffered a much more serious grievance. This includes both forgiving others as well as yourself.
 
Letting go and offering yourself forgiveness can help boost your feelings of wellness and improve your image of yourself. Numerous studies have demonstrated that when people practice self-forgiveness, they experience lower levels of depression and anxiety.﻿﻿ Similarly, self-compassion is associated with higher levels of success, productivity, focus, and concentration.
 
The act of forgiveness can also positively impact your physical health. Research shows that forgiveness can improve cholesterol levels; reduce bodily pain and blood pressure; and lower your risk of a heart attack.﻿﻿
 
Having a compassionate and forgiving attitude toward yourself is also a critical component of successful relationships.﻿﻿ Being able to forge close emotional bonds with other people is important, but so is the ability to repair those bonds when they become fraught or damaged.
 
One study found that both parties benefit from the ""offending partner"" showing self-forgiveness. Specifically, both partners tended to feel more relationship satisfaction and have fewer negative thoughts about each other as a result of genuine self-forgiveness.﻿﻿
 
So what is it that makes self-forgiveness so difficult at times? Why do people often continue to punish and berate themselves over relatively minor mistakes? Engaging in actions that are not in line with our own values or self-beliefs can lead to feelings of guilt and regret—or worse, self-loathing.﻿﻿
 
Some people are just naturally more prone to rumination, which can make it easier to dwell on negative feelings. The fact that self-forgiveness involves acknowledging wrongdoing and admitting that you might need to change can make the process more challenging.﻿﻿
 
Lastly, people who are not yet ready to change may find it harder to truly forgive themselves. Instead, of admitting they might need to change, they might engage in a sort of pseudo-self-forgiveness by simply overlooking or excusing their behavior.﻿﻿
 
While self-forgiveness is generally thought of as a positive action that can help restore the sense of self, there is also research indicating that it can sometimes have a detrimental effect.
 
The major pitfall of self-forgiveness is that it can sometimes reduce empathy for those who have been hurt by your actions. Although self-forgiveness often relieves feelings of guilt, there are times this inward focus may make it more difficult to identify with others.﻿﻿ You can avoid this by consciously practicing empathy with those who have been affected by your actions.
 
Forgiving people who have hurt you can be challenging, but forgiving yourself can be just as difficult. It is important to remember that learning how to forgive yourself is not a one-size-fits-all process. It is never simple or easy, but working on this form of self-compassion can convey a number of possible health benefits.﻿﻿ In addition to reducing stress, depression, and anxiety, self-forgiveness can also have positive effects on your physical health and relationships.

We all go through periods where we feel like we might be stuck in a rut. In fact, it's not uncommon to feel like you're just going through the motions, treading water, or jogging in place. You're doing the same old things, but it doesn't seem like you are actually getting anywhere. Things that used to excite you start to feel less interesting. Instead of moving forward toward your goals, you're remaining stagnant. These feelings can be frustrating. But, there are things that you can do to not only figure out why you're stuck, but also learn how to get motivated and excited again.
 
Being ""stuck"" is something you may not even notice at first. These feelings often build slowly over time. Day after day, you might follow your same routines. Eventually, it feels less like you are working toward something and more like you're just killing time. Here are some of the signs that you might be stuck in a rut.
 
Sometimes these feelings may be more than just being stuck in a rut. Such feelings may be signs of something more serious, such as persistent depressive disorder (PDD).﻿﻿ This mild, but chronic, mood disorder is characterized by symptoms that are less severe than depression but can often be longer-lasting.
 
People often experience these symptoms for years without recognizing that what they're feeling is actually a form of depression. Low mood, decreased energy, loss of interest, and loss of pleasure are all common symptoms of this condition.﻿﻿ If you suspect that you may be experiencing PDD, talk to your doctor about your symptoms.
 
While you might recognize that you are stuck in a rut, you might not know what the next step should be. One thing to remember is that not all ruts are the same. Figure out what's causing your discontentment before you make any drastic changes in your life. Consider working with a licensed counselor or cognitive behavioral therapist to help you with this.﻿﻿
 
For instance, you might feel like you are in a rut with your romantic partner. Or perhaps your job is the source of your feelings. Even your health, your family situation, your friendships, your hobbies, or your home can cause unhappiness.
 
Don't criticize or berate yourself once you understand the root cause of your feelings.﻿﻿ It's easy to minimize the problem and try to make your feelings seem trivial. You might think: ""I have a great life,"" or ""I don't have a right to feel this way."" But, these thoughts are counterproductive and keep you trapped in the rut. While things may be ""just fine"" as they are, if you're not satisfied, it's time to make changes and regain your spark.
 
Once you've acknowledged what you're feeling, start looking for ways to get unstuck. There are a number of ways to break the negative cycle and move forward. Here are a few ideas on how to get out of a rut.
 
When you feel stuck in a rut, combat it by taking care of yourself. Self-compassion is critical to mental wellness.﻿﻿ Start with a quick assessment of how well you've been taking care of you. Have you been eating well? Are you sleeping enough? Have you been spending enough time with people who care about and support you?
 
If something is lacking in the self-care department, now is the time to address it. Healthy food, adequate sleep, daily exercise, and social support are all essential to your physical and emotional health.﻿﻿ Look for ways to treat yourself a little better. Taking care of yourself ensures you have the energy to stay focused and excited about your life.
 
It's hard to move forward or branch out if you're following the same routines day after day. People are creatures of habit, and sometimes feeling stuck stems from boredom. Look for ways to add different experiences to your day. Here are some things you might try.
 
Researchers have discovered that being in nature has a positive impact on the brain. For example, one study found that taking a walk outside reduced self-referential rumination, a behavior that can increase the risk of depression.﻿﻿ Another study found that nature walks were associated with decreased depression, lowered stress, and increased mental well-being.﻿﻿
 
Not only can being outside increase your mental wellness, studies have shown that it enhances creativity as well. The next time you're feeling bogged down, try going for a walk. Let go of the thoughts circling around in your brain. Pay attention to the world around you. Allow yourself to relax, think of new things, and enjoy the beauty you see. If nothing else, it's a great way to get some exercise. You will return to your everyday life with a renewed sense of wonder.
 
It's easy to fall into a rut when it feels like you're not really working toward anything. Having things to look forward to and a sense of purpose are key ingredients for motivation. For instance, life goals related to your career or your relationships can provide a sense of purpose. Even small things, like having plans for Friday night, can lift your spirits.
 
In fact, researchers have discovered that having something to look forward to helps people cope with troubles in the here and now. Psychologists have long recognized the importance of delayed gratification. By holding out for larger rewards in the future, people build better self-control and stronger willpower.
 
In one study, chronic gamblers were asked to think about upcoming events like a future vacation.﻿﻿ By doing so, they were able to curb their impulse to gamble. Thinking about the future allowed them to focus on their long-term goals rather than giving in to the desire for immediate gratification. Here are some ways to give yourself something to look forward to.
 
Sometimes getting out of a rut happens spontaneously. For example, you might feel stuck in a rut one day and then something suddenly clicks into place and the feelings vanish. In other cases, you might need to take a more active approach. One way to do that is to focus on your motivation. Here are some ways to get motivated, even when you don't feel particularly interested or excited about what you are doing.
 
If you struggle with perfectionism, this can keep you stuck in the same place. No matter how hard you try, it seems like whatever you're working on is never good enough.﻿﻿ But, you need to squash your tendencies toward perfectionism right away and recognize that done is better than perfect. In other words, rather than trying to make a project perfect, be satisfied with the fact that you completed it.
 
If left unchecked, perfectionism can keep you spinning your wheels for a very long time. Instead, focus on completing projects and moving forward rather than striving for perfection. Let yourself make mistakes. Embrace the fact that you have given your best effort and move on. In time, you will be much more productive and creative when you're no longer tethered to perfectionism.
 
Feeling stuck in a rut can be frustrating. But with a little effort, you can add a sense of novelty, adventure, and excitement back into your life. If you're feeling overwhelmed by that thought, you might be experiencing something more serious. Loss of interest in things you enjoyed, difficulty feeling happy emotions, and a sense of hopelessness are symptoms of depression.﻿﻿ If what you're feeling is more than just being stuck in a rut, talk to your doctor right away.

 Every day seems the same. You might even have trouble remembering what day of the week it is. Is it Monday, or is it Friday? It doesn’t matter because your days feel indistinguishable from one another. You feel like you're just trying to get through another day. Your goal is to keep putting one foot ahead of the other until the day is done. You don't feel excited or inspired. You feel unmotivated. You might want to take on new projects or engage in creative tasks, but it feels like your motivation has run dry. You just can't seem to get started.﻿﻿ You feel unfulfilled. Life feels dull and boring. You want to try new things, but you don't know where to begin. You want to change, but fear the temporary discomfort that comes with it. You know that changing things up will make you happier in the long run, but you keep sticking with the status quo because it means you won't have to risk any pain or failure.﻿﻿ Strike up a conversation. Talking to new people is a great way to expand your social connections. Plus, you will learn interesting things about the people around you. Have some fun. Spending some time engaged in an activity you truly love is good for your health.﻿﻿ Whether it's hanging out with friends or pursuing a hobby, set aside time during the week and focus your energy on having a good time. Try something new. Whether it's taking a new route to work, watching a new show, or signing up for a class, exploring the world around you can add zest to your life.﻿﻿ Be spontaneous. If you're bored with your life, live in the moment. Do things that are not pre-planned. Say yes to new experiences; and don't be afraid to do the unexpected. Make plans. There is a great deal of power in anticipation. Sometimes you might look forward to existing events, such as the release of a movie or your favorite holiday. But you also can create these moments intentionally. Plan a vacation, even if it's just taking a day trip to a local spot. Call or text friends and make plans for Friday night. Give yourself things to look forward to and get excited about. Don't overlook the little things. Even small daily and weekly rewards such as being able to go to your favorite place for lunch or tuning into your favorite TV show once a week are great ways to build a sense of anticipation for the future. Volunteer to serve others. Having a sense of purpose also comes from helping others. Look for ways to contribute in your community. Or, focus on helping your friends or loved ones with a project. Participate in your church. Volunteer with a local organization. Or, even engage in political activism. Such activities give you a sense of greater purpose and meaning and are good for your mental well-being, too.﻿﻿ Take small steps. Pick something that you think you might like to pursue, such as a new hobby or workout program. Start small with something you know you can accomplish, yet is just outside of your current skill level. Don't wait for motivation or inspiration to strike. Just get going. Force yourself to get through the first step. Once you have mastered it, pick another small step and master it. Eventually, going through the motions will be a thing of the past and you will feel involved, excited, and interested in learning more. Reward yourself. Positive reinforcement is helpful when you're struggling to get motivated. Promise yourself a reward for starting the task. Then, continue to reward yourself after completing each step. Eventually, pull back on the rewards, but promise yourself a larger reward once you have reached your goals. Rewards can get you started and help generate greater interest in what you are working on.﻿﻿",periods feel like might stick rut fact uncommon feel like motion tread water jog place old things seem

Animals can provide joy and companionship. Animals can also provide emotional support to people with mental health concerns. These animal companions are known as emotional support animals (ESAs), and they have been growing in popularity in recent years.
 
An emotional support animal is an animal companion that offers some type of benefit to an individual with some form of disability. The animal is intended to provide companionship and support that will help alleviate at least one aspect of the disability.
 
Dogs are the most common type of emotional support animal, but cats are quite common as well. Other types of animals, such as miniature horses, can also serve as ESAs.
 
For example, a peacock made headlines after it was denied from entering a United Airlines flight, despite the fact that its owner said that the animal was an emotional support animal. Some of the more unusual emotional support animals that have flown with their owners include a pig, a duck, a monkey, and a turkey. The vast majority of ESAs are not rare, exotic, or barnyard creatures.
 
Why would an individual choose to use an emotional support animal? Research has long supported the idea that animals can provide significant mental health benefits. One research review found that owning a pet has positive effects on mental health by fostering emotional connectivity and helping people manage in times of crisis.
 
Some of the other benefits that emotional support animals may provide include:
 
It's easy to say that animals can help make people calmer, happier, and even more fulfilled. But are emotional support animals really that different from any beloved pet? So far, the research remains inconclusive. While some suggest that support animals may produce positive effects, support for the therapeutic effectiveness of emotional support animals tends to be scant.
 
For example, research has not been able to demonstrate that support animals provide significant benefits over what any regular pet would provide. According to a 2016 study published in the journal Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, it is not clear whether emotional support animals have any therapeutic effects beyond the positive benefits that animals provide in general.
 
“Little empirical data exists to support the conclusion that ESAs are effective in mitigating psychological disorders and related problems, and empirical research that does exist is inconsistent, sparse and emerging,” suggested psychologists Jeffrey Younggren and his colleagues in an article published by the American Psychological Association in 2016.
 Further research may be needed to help demonstrate what impact emotional support animals might have and when ESAs may be the most beneficial.  
While emotional support animals and service animals share some similarities, there are important distinctions between the two. Emotional support animals are intended to provide companionship and support. Service animals, on the other hand, assist individuals with disabilities by performing specific tasks. 
 
Service animals are those that have been specially trained to perform a service for a person with some form of disability. Such disabilities may be sensory, physical, intellectual, psychiatric, or mental in nature. Tasks that a service animal might perform include alerting a person about a sound, guiding a person along the street, pressing an elevator button, retrieving items, alerting others or standing guard if the individual is experiencing a seizure, or reminding the individual to take his or her medication.
 
Emotional support animals, on the other hand, are there to provide companionship aimed at alleviating distress or provide some other type of relief. 
 
Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act specify that service animals must be dogs, although reasonable accommodations must be made to allow miniature horses to serve as service animals in cases where the animals have received training to perform specific tasks for the disabled person.
 Provide companionship and emotional support to individuals with disabilities Do not require specialized training  Covered under the Federal Fair Housing Act Assist individuals with disabilities with specific tasks (reminding someone to take their meds, alert others of a seizure, etc.) Require specialized training Covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act 
It is also important to note that emotional support animals and psychiatric service animals are not the same things. Where an emotional support animal may provide benefits to people with mental illness, psychiatric service animals are specially trained to perform specific tasks for people with psychiatric conditions. This might include reminding the individual to take their medications or stop someone from engaging in self-harm.
 
Under the Federal Fair Housing Act, housing providers are required to make reasonable accommodations to allow individuals with disabilities to keep an assistant animal in their home. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires housing providers to make exceptions to ""no pets"" policies.
 
The two conditions required for such an exception:
 
HUD does not specify which disabilities qualify an individual for an exception. Rather, they state that the functions of an ESA include ""providing emotional support to persons with disabilities who have a disability-related need for such support.”
 
An exception usually requires a verification letter from a mental health professional stating the individual's needs for an emotional support animal. Landlords may also require that people requesting accommodation also submit a verification form completed by a physician or therapist that confirms the disability.
 Under the FHA, landlords cannot legally: 
However, tenants are financially responsible if their animal causes any type of damage to persons or property.
 
While the Americans With Disabilities Act allows people to legally bring their service animals into public areas, emotional support animals are not covered by the law. Emotional support animals do not meet the definition of a service animal under the law, which requires that service animals be specifically trained to perform tasks to help the individual with the disability. Because of this, business and public spaces can deny the admission of emotional support animals.
 
While there is some evidence pointing to the value of emotional support animals, not everyone agrees that they are always necessary. Some mental health experts have suggested that support animals may be overused.
 
The number of emotional support animals appears to be growing every year. United Airlines, one of the largest airline carriers in the US, reported a 75% increase in the number of emotional support animals flying on the airline between the years 2016 and 2017.
 
One study published in PLOS ONE found that the number of emotional support animals found in the state of California had increased 10-fold between 2002 and 2012.
 
Airlines, other businesses, and federal regulators are now considering additional rules regarding the use of ESAs, including:
 
The increased demand for ESA's sometimes places therapists in a bind as well. More and more, patients request letters of documentation supporting their need for an emotional support animal from their psychologist, therapist, or doctor.
 
Why are so many people interested in having a support companion? Many experts attribute it to the fact that the law allows these individuals with disabilities to bring an emotional support animal on a plane at no additional cost. Normally, airlines require people to pay an extra fee to bring their pets on a flight, but with a letter stating that they need an emotional support animal, people can avoid this fee.
 
The Air Carrier Access act suggests that a wide variety of animals may be permitted to board flights as emotional support animals, although airlines are able to use their discretion in cases where animals are too heavy, large, or disrupting as well as those prohibited in other countries.
 
The problem is that the law is vague in defining exactly who needs an ESA. This has led to many people attempting to obtain letters supporting their need for an emotional support animal in order to travel with their pet without having to pay to bring the animal on board the flight.
 
People also occasionally obtain letters from physicians and psychologists in order to justify keeping an animal in their rental home or apartment. Because the Fair Housing Act requires landlords to allow renters to keep emotional support animals in their residence, tenants may sometimes have their pet designated as an emotional support animal to keep their pets in their homes.
 
The vagueness of the law creates a quandary for many psychologists and therapists. Do they write a letter for a patient who may not truly have the need, or do they deny the request and risk losing the patient?
 
Some patients may become angry if a therapist or doctor denies their request for a documentation letter. This creates an ethical problem for therapists. Should they write a letter in order to ensure that a patient stays in treatment, even if they do not feel that a support animal is necessary?
 Many experts believe that additional guidelines are needed to help psychologists, therapists, and physicians determine who needs emotional support animals. 
In the absence of such guidelines, a number of online businesses have emerged that promise to deliver a diagnosis and provide an ESA documentation letter. Many of these sites promise to provide a diagnosis and letter of documentation in under 24 hours for less than $100.
 
This type of abuse of the law has led to many airlines requiring that an ESA documentation letter be submitted in advance of the flight along with the name and contact information of the mental health professional who provided the diagnosis.
 
For example, in June 2018, JetBlue announced that it would require passengers to submit additional proof that their emotional support animals were needed and properly trained. Representatives for the airline attributed the new rules to ""dramatic increase in industry incidents involving emotional support animals that haven't been adequately trained to behave in a busy airport or the confined space of an aircraft.”
 
These rules include only accepting dogs, cats, and miniature horses as support animals and only allowing one animal per customer. Passengers are also required to submit a medical form completed by their care provider, a veterinary health form, and an animal behavior form. 
 Requirements vary from one airline to another, so passengers should check carefully to see what forms and documentation they may need to provide before boarding with their emotional support animal. 
Emotional support animals may be helpful to those with certain mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. If you feel that a support animal may help relieve your symptoms, talk to your doctor or therapist about some of the possible benefits and risks.
 
Having a pet requires an investment of time and effort, so it is important to be sure that you are prepared for the commitment and capable of caring for the animal. It may be helpful to talk about what you hope to gain from having an emotional support animal and discuss which type of animal might be right for your needs.
 If you want an ESA in order to avoid paying an extra flight fee or pet deposit, consider the effect your actions may have on people who have genuine needs for a support animal. 
An ESA can provide support and comfort that some individuals may need to cope with their disorder or disability. Obtaining an ESA documentation letter to avoid paying extra for your pet ultimately hurts the legitimacy of the many patients who have a real need for a support animal.
 
If you feel you have a legitimate need for an emotional support animal, talk to the doctor or therapist who is currently treating you. Don't buy a letter from a scammy online site that promises a dubious certification document to anyone willing to pay their fee.
 
While research has yet to demonstrate the long-term effects of emotional support animals for alleviating the symptoms of psychological conditions, you may find a support animal a helpful and rewarding addition to your existing treatment plan. Whether you are dealing with stress, anxiety, trauma, or some other type of mental health condition, a pet can provide companionship and support. Talk to your care provider about whether an emotional support animal might be helpful for your individual situation.
 Less anxiety. Simply petting an animal can create a relaxation response and elevate mood. Trauma support. Pets can provide comfort to people who are dealing with difficult situations, including those who have experienced some type of trauma. Improved physical health. Studies have found that emotional support animals help to lower blood pressure, decrease respiration rates, and improve the ability to cope with pain. Fewer feelings of loneliness. Animals can provide companionship, which is especially important for people who live alone and experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Reciprocal care and love. Caring for an emotional support animal can also help give people a sense of purpose. Not only do animals provide unconditional love and companionship, but they also require care and love in return, which can be emotionally rewarding. Provide companionship and emotional support to individuals with disabilities Do not require specialized training Covered under the Federal Fair Housing Act Assist individuals with disabilities with specific tasks (reminding someone to take their meds, alert others of a seizure, etc.) Require specialized training Covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act The individual living with the animal must have some type of disability that significantly limits one or more major life activities.

"
Anger, frustration, fear, and other ""negative emotions"" are all part of the human experience. They can all lead to stress and are often seen as emotions to be avoided, ignored, or in other ways disavowed, but they can actually be healthy for us to experience as well. A better approach is to manage them without denying them, and there are several reasons for this.
 
The idea of ""managing"" negative emotions is a complex one. It doesn't mean avoiding feeling them—avoidance coping is actually a form of coping that attempts to do this, and it can often backfire.﻿﻿ It also doesn't mean letting these negative emotions wreak havoc on your life, your relationships, and your stress levels. Unmanaged anger, for example, can compel us to destroy relationships if we allow it to.
 
Managing negative emotions is more about embracing the fact that we are feeling them, determining why we are feeling this way, and allowing ourselves to receive the messages that they are sending us before we release them and move forward. (Yes, that statement may sound a little odd, but our emotions are definitely designed to be messengers to tell us something, and these messages can be very valuable if we listen.)
 Managing negative emotions also means not allowing them to overrun us. We can keep them under control without denying that we are feeling them. 
When we talk about so-called negative emotions, it's important to remember that these emotions, in themselves, aren't negative as in ""bad,"" but more than they are in the realm of negativity as opposed to positivity.﻿﻿ Emotions aren't necessarily good or bad, they are just states and signals that allow us to pay more attention to the events that create them, either to get us motivated to create more of a certain experience or less, for example. Unlike some emotions, they're not always pleasant to experience, but like most emotions, they exist for a reason and can actually be quite useful to feel.
 
Anger, fear, resentment, frustration, and anxiety are emotional states that many people experience regularly but try to avoid. And this is understandable—they are designed to make us uncomfortable. These negative emotional states can create extra stress in your body and your mind, which is uncomfortable but also can lead to health issues if the stress becomes chronic or overwhelming.﻿﻿ Nobody likes to feel uncomfortable, so it is natural to want to escape these feelings, and the dangers of unmanaged stress are real. However, there is a feeling that people sometimes have that these emotions will last forever or that the feelings themselves are the problem.
 
More often, these feelings are beneficial because they can also send us messages. Anger and anxiety, for example, show that something needs to change, and perhaps that our well-being has been threatened. Fear is an appeal to increase your level of safety. Resentment motivates us to change something in a relationship. Frustration does as well. Basically, negative emotions are there to alert us that something needs to change and to motivate us to make that change.
 
Positive psychologists also argue that while there are many benefits to positive emotional states like hope, joy, and gratitude, there are also negative effects that can come from them. Optimism, for example, has been linked to many beneficial outcomes for health and happiness as well as personal success.﻿﻿ Unchecked optimism, however, can lead to unrealistic expectations and even dangerous risks that can lead to loss and all of the negative feelings that can come with it. More uncomfortable emotional states like anxiety, however, can lead to motivation to make changes that can create more success and avoid danger.
 Negative emotions are designed to keep us safe and to motivate us to improve our lives, just as positive emotions are. 
The field of positive psychology is experiencing a ""second wave"" of research that is focused not only on what makes us happy, resilient, and able to thrive but also on the dark side of happiness.﻿﻿ We've learned more, recently, about how our negative emotions affect us and what to do with them, and how we can remain emotionally healthy throughout the process. Just as there are benefits to negative emotions, there are detriments to ""false positivity"" where we shame ourselves for experiencing these natural states and try to deny them or force ourselves to pretend we feel more positive than we do. A better strategy is to accept and even embrace our negative states, while also engaging in activities that can counter-balance these uncomfortable emotions in an authentic way.
 
There are several strategies that have been explored and recommended as a means to accepting and processing negative emotions, as well as emerging techniques that have been developed with this research in mind. A specific group of approaches is gaining popularity among therapists and coaches. These techniques, as outlined in research by Ceri Sims, have the acronym TEARS of HOPE. Here's what this entails:
 
T - Teach and learn. This means to embrace self-awareness and increase personal knowledge of your body and mind, and how they are responding to stress and other emotional states. This allows you to understand when you are upset and why, and be better able to interpret the signals your body is sending.
 
E - Express and enable sensory and embodied experiences. This one sounds a little more complicated but it simply involves encouraging openness and curiosity within yourself to increase your acceptance of what comes.
 
A - Accept and befriend. It can be highly beneficial to actively focus on increasing your own self-compassion and tolerance for frustration.
 
R - Re-appraise and re-frame. You can use cognitive-behavioral approaches to see things differently.
 
S - Social support. This can involve the practice of loving-kindness meditation, which can expand your feelings of connection to others and your self-compassion while you invest in relationships.
 
(OF)
 
H - Hedonic well-being/happiness: Research shows that it can be highly beneficial to have a 3-to-1 ratio of positive vs. negative emotions, meaning that you add positive experiences to your life, focus on happy memories and savor successes, for example, to increase the amount of time you spend authentically feeling good.
 
O - Observe and attend To: Try to practice mindfulness﻿﻿ and non-judgmentally attend to things in life.
 
P - Physiology and behavioral changes: Focus on relaxation, breathing exercises, and self-care.
 
E - Eudaimonia: This means to strive for goals in life and a sense of authenticity.
 
There are other strategies that are recommended as ways to increase positive emotional states and personal resilience to stress and feelings of negativity so that negative emotional states don't feel as overwhelming. And because of the research on positivity, we know that this can be a beneficial thing in itself. Here are some additional strategies that can be used to cope with negative emotions.
 
This involves envisioning—you guessed it—your best possible self and what that would look like. This exercise has been shown to lift the mood and bring a sense of optimism, both of which bring lasting benefits.﻿﻿ This can be done as a journaling exercise or simply a visualization technique, but basically involves envisioning your life in the future and challenging yourself to imagine the best possible life you can live, the best possible version of yourself that you can be.
 
Research has shown that people who engage in this activity for five minutes a day for two weeks experience a more positive mood and an increase in optimism compared to people who spent the same amount of time simply thinking about activities in their day. For five minutes a day, this is a great use of time.
 
This activity is popular with positive psychology students. It involves expressing gratitude to people who have done kind things for you, both minor and major.﻿﻿ This could be a letter to an elementary school teacher who inspired you to be your best or a visit to a neighbor to let them know how much you appreciate knowing they are there. It can be any letter or personal trip and conversation expressing to someone what they have done for you, what it has meant to you and that you appreciate them.
 These expressions of gratitude bring great benefits to the recipients, but even greater ones to the person expressing the gratitude. Most people who engage in this activity report that they still feel positive feelings from it days or even weeks later. 
This is like taking a staycation, but it involves creating a day that's filled with positive experiences that you'd have on vacation while minimizing the stress you'd have in your regular schedule. It operates under the same premise that the other positivity-building exercises follow—that an increase in positive emotional states can bring a greater sense of optimism and resilience—and it has the added benefit of minimizing stressors for the day. (This can offer a nice interruption from chronic stress and a chance to recover emotionally.) To do this, create a day filled with activities that you enjoy.

If you ever felt completely immersed in an activity, you might have been experiencing a mental state that psychologists refer to as flow. What exactly is flow?
 
Imagine for a moment that you are running a race. Your attention is focused on the movements of your body, the power of your muscles, the force of your lungs, and the feel of the street beneath your feet. You are living in the moment, utterly absorbed in the present activity. Time seems to fall away. You are tired, but you barely notice.
 
According to positive psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, what you are experiencing at that moment is known as flow, a state of complete immersion in an activity. He describes the mental state of flow as ""being completely involved in an activity for its own sake.
 
The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost.""
 
Flow experiences can occur in different ways for different people. Some might experience flow while engaging in a sport such as skiing, tennis, soccer, dancing, or running. Others might have such an experience while engaged in an activity such as painting, drawing, or writing. These moments of flow often occur when you are engaged in an activity that you enjoy and in which you are quite skilled.
 
According to Csíkszentmihályi, there are ten factors that accompany the experience of flow. While many of these components may be present, it is not necessary to experience all of them for flow to occur:
 
So what can you do to increase your chances of achieving flow? In his book, Csíkszentmihályi explains that flow is likely to occur when an individual is faced with a task that has clear goals that require specific responses.
 
A game of chess is a good example of when a flow state might occur. For the duration of a competition, the player has very specific goals and responses, allowing attention to be focused entirely on the game during the period of play.
 
""Flow also happens when a person's skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable, so it acts as a magnet for learning new skills and increasing challenges,"" Csíkszentmihályi explains. ""If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills.""
 
While flow experiences can happen as part of everyday life, there are also important practical applications in various areas including education, sports, and the workplace.
 
In addition to making activities more enjoyable, flow also has a number of other advantages such as:
 
Achieving a state of flow can be a great way to make the activities you pursue more engaging and enjoyable. Not only do people often perform better when they are in this state of flow, but they are also often able to improve their skills in that area.
 The activity is intrinsically rewarding Clear goals that, while challenging, are still attainable Complete focus on the activity itself Feelings of personal control over the situation and the outcome Feelings of serenity; a loss of feelings of self-consciousness Immediate feedback Knowing that the task is doable; a balance between skill level and the challenge presented Lack of awareness of physical needs Strong concentration and focused attention Timelessness; a distorted sense of time; feeling so focused on the present that you lose track of time passing It is an activity that you enjoy or feel passionate about There is an element of challenge You are able to stretch your current skill level You have a specific goal and plan of action Flow in education: Csíkszentmihályi has suggested that overlearning a skill or concept can help people experience flow. Another critical concept in his theory is the idea of slightly extending oneself beyond one's current ability level. This slight stretching of one's current skills can help the individual experience flow. Flow in sports: Just like in educational settings, engaging in a challenging athletic activity that is doable but presents a slight stretching of one's abilities is a good way to achieve flow. Sometimes described by being ""in the zone,"" reaching this state of flow allows an athlete to experience a loss of self-consciousness and a sense of complete mastery of the performance. Flow in the workplace: Flow can also occur when workers are engaged in tasks where they are able to focus entirely on the project at hand. For example, a writer might experience this while working on a novel or a graphic designer might achieve flow while working on a website illustration. Improved performance: Researchers have found that flow can enhance performance in a wide variety of areas including teaching, learning, athletics, and artistic creativity. Learning and skill development: Because the act of achieving flow indicates a substantial mastery of a certain skill, the individual must continually seek new challenges and information in order to maintain this state.",ever felt completely immerse activity might experience mental state psychologists refer flow exactly flow imagine moment run race attention focus movements body power muscle force lungs feel street beneath feet live moment utterly absorb present activity time seem fall away tire barely notice accord positive psychologist mih kszentmih lyi experience moment know flow state complete immersion activity describe mental state flow completely involve activity sake ego fall away time fly every action movement think follow inevitably previous one like play jazz whole involve use skills utmost flow experience occur different ways different people might experience flow engage sport ski tennis soccer dance run others might experience engage activity paint draw write moments flow often occur engage activity enjoy quite skilled accord kszentmih lyi ten factor accompany experience flow many components may present necessary experience flow occur increase chance achieve flow book kszentmih lyi explain flow likely occur individual face task clear goals require specific responses game chess good example flow state might occur duration competition player specific goals responses allow attention focus entirely game period play flow also happen person skills fully involve overcome challenge manageable act magnet learn new skills increase challenge kszentmih lyi explain challenge low one get back flow increase challenge great one return flow state learn new skills flow experience happen part everyday life also important practical applications various areas include education sport workplace addition make activities enjoyable flow also number advantage achieve state flow great way make activities pursue engage enjoyable people often perform better state flow also often able improve skills area activity intrinsically reward clear goals challenge still attainable complete focus activity feel personal control situation outcome feel serenity loss feel self consciousness immediate feedback know task doable balance skill level challenge present lack awareness physical need strong concentration focus attention timelessness distort sense time feel focus present lose track time pass activity enjoy feel passionate element challenge able stretch current skill level specific goal plan action flow education kszentmih lyi suggest overlearning skill concept help people experience flow another critical concept theory idea slightly extend oneself beyond one current ability level slight stretch one current skills help individual experience flow flow sport like educational settings engage challenge athletic activity doable present slight stretch one abilities good way achieve flow sometimes describe zone reach state flow allow athlete experience loss self consciousness sense complete mastery performance flow workplace flow also occur workers engage task able focus entirely project hand example writer might experience work novel graphic designer might achieve flow work website illustration improve performance researchers find flow enhance performance wide variety areas include teach learn athletics artistic creativity learn skill development act achieve flow indicate substantial mastery certain skill individual must continually seek new challenge information order maintain state

What is the image of success that you have in your mind? We might think that success means being able to collect material possessions, achieve certain professional status or having a particular amount of money in the bank. But what about successes in everyday life? The things that go unseen such as the accomplishment of meaningful tasks, living with purpose, finding courage to do new things, resisting temptation, mastering a skill?
 
People move through their lives never celebrating success because they often don't recognize when they have been successful. Our personal definition of success greatly influences our perception of self and the meanings we place on our experiences. Developing your authentic and personalized definition of success is key when talking about healthy ways to celebrate.
 
Psychologist and author of Emotional Success: The Power of Gratitude, Compassion and Pride, David DeSteno, PhD, studies the relationships between emotions and success. In his work, DeSteno shares that emotions, such as pride, can lead people to greater future success. Regarding prosocial emotions such as gratitude, compassion and pride, he states:
 
Dr. DeSteno goes on to share that not only are these prosocial emotions that we would experience when celebrating help us develop greater resiliency and motivation for the future, but they are also contagious. He states, ""Those around us become more likely to apply them when we do."" How wonderful is that? We can enjoy the benefits of celebrating our accomplishments while also encouraging those around us to achieve and celebrate their own.
 
When we think of celebrating we may think about rewarding ourselves after accomplishing a goal or job well done. Although rewarding yourself may feel the same as celebrating, a reward suggests that there is no continuation of effort in that particular task after earning the prize.
 Celebrating is about an appreciation of the process, your effort, those who have supported you along the way and where you would like to go next. 
Extrinsic motivation is when we feel motivated to complete a task because we want to earn an external reward, such as a gift, ribbon, trophy or money. The process of completing the task becomes more about the final outcome than the process and effort required to complete the task. When we rely too much on extrinsic motivation and reward, it can be difficult to find the energy to engage in the task itself when that external reward is removed. 
 
Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is motivation that comes from within rather than focusing only on the outcome or reward. This type of motivation has more to do with the process and effort of the task than the outcome. When intrinsically motivated, people will engage in a task for the joy of doing so, even if there is no trophy to be won at the end. Celebrating success in a healthy way allows us to enhance the positive emotion around our effort, further increasing our intrinsic motivation
 
There are a few simple ways that you can celebrate your success and promote motivation to continue on your journey to personal fulfillment.
 
Personal Reflection
 
What is it that you are celebrating? Sure, winning the game or meeting your sales quota would be reasons to celebrate, but if we take away the outcome and look at the journey it took to get there, what would you want to celebrate most? Take time to reflect on things like the elements of your value system that guided your decision making and the personal strengths that helped you achieve your goal.
 
In your reflection, you might ask yourself questions like:
 
Answering questions like these in your reflection can help clarify what it is that you are celebrating about your success. When you are mindful about what you are celebrating, you are practicing gratitude and enhancing personal strengths that will likely be used in future tasks. Give your celebration meaning and purpose to build confidence for the next challenge. 
 
Include Others
 
When celebrating success it can be easy to forget others who may have helped us, in ways big or small, to reach the finish line. Including others in your celebration is a wonderful way to build and strengthen connection with coworkers, loved ones or others who helped you along the way. Give them specific feedback about the ways that they helped you achieve your goal and express gratitude for their help.
 
People enjoy feeling helpful, appreciated and connected. When you celebrate success with others you are nurturing the kind of meaningful relationships that allow those same people to want to help you in the future.
 
Be Present
 
In our fast-paced society we seem to always be focused on the future. When we have reached one goal we quickly move on to the next, often with no celebration at all. In fact, sometimes it can feel uncomfortable for people to celebrate their own success for fear that they would be drawing too much attention to themselves or setting themselves up for embarrassment.
 
Celebrating your success, especially in the ways we are talking about here, includes slowing down to appreciate and live the experience of your success with those who are important to you.
 
Nurture Yourself
 
Celebrate in fun ways that nurture your mind, body, and spirit. Decide to celebrate in ways that speak to you and what you enjoy most. Examples of ways to celebrate while nurturing at the same time include:
 
An important piece of celebrating your success in healthy ways is to simply take the time to do it. Enjoy your efforts, energy, and accomplishments. Include others who have helped you along the way and remember to celebrate in ways that nurture your mind, body and spirit.

"
Self-hate can feel like having a person following you around, all day every day, criticizing you and pointing out every flaw or shaming you for every mistake. It can feel awful. Typical self-hatred thoughts may include:
 Self loathing is extreme criticism of oneself. It may feel as though nothing you do is good enough or that you are unworthy or undeserving of good things in life. 
Self-hatred develops over time. It's typically triggered by more than one factor, including past trauma, perfectionism, false expectations, social comparisons, and several learned behaviors.
 
Many people with extreme self-hatred have been through traumatic and emotionally challenging experiences in their past. These experiences often include sexual, physical, or emotional abuse and neglect.﻿﻿
 
When children experience trauma, they begin to view the world as unsafe and the people around them as dangerous. In an effort to make sense of their world, they may develop a narrative that makes them feel as if they are not worth loving and have no value. These hateful statements may have been said directly to them by a parent or other loved one, and they soon become an all too familiar part of their inner critic.
 If trauma is behind your self-hatred, consider seeking professional help. Whether a therapist, minister, or spiritual counselor, professional support can enable you to understand the root of your self-loathing and take steps toward self-compassion. 
It is normal to want to belong, be accepted, or perform a task well. However, sometimes our expectations of self can be so high that they are unattainable by any human. These extraordinary expectations often lead to us falling short and feeling as if we have failed.
 
In these moments, our inner critic shows up to shame us and remind us how disappointing we have been. Even if our rational side recognizes that the expectations are unreasonable, our inner critic continues to drive home statements of self-hate.
 
In an effort to be connected to others, we may have learned over time that meeting the expectations of others works well. We might learn through social experiences that when other people are happy with us, we can feel happy with ourselves. This is not a healthy way of thinking about relationships and it may even lead to significant patterns of dependent behavior.﻿﻿
 
Nonetheless, some people feel devastated when they are not able to meet the needs of others or they feel they have disappointed someone. Statements of self-hatred suggest that when we don't meet the expectations of others something is wrong with us; we have failed or we are not worthy of being loved or valued by others.
 
A perfectionist is often viewed as someone who allows themselves no margin of error, no wiggle room for human mistakes or limitations. They expect perfection of themselves (and possibly others) at all times and in all situations.
 
It is important to note that we often develop a perfectionist mindset in an effort to protect ourselves from pain and feelings of disconnection.﻿﻿ The belief is that when you perform perfectly, you are somehow preventing yourself from feeling pain. This pain may include feelings of shame, embarrassment, loneliness, abandonment, ridicule, judgment, and more.
 
While it is normal to look around and notice what others are doing, it can become painful when you place value on that observation. If you experience self-hatred, it is common to have what is referred to as upward comparison. This simply means having a tendency to only notice and give value to people who are performing ""better"" and, in turn, devaluing yourself with statements of self-hatred.
 
Self-hatred affects and influences many aspects of daily living. Self-hatred can prevent you from making important decisions, taking risks, connecting with others, and achieving goals. If you struggle with self-hatred, you may experience its consequences in many areas and ways.
 
Not surprisingly, self-hatred as a negative impact on self-concept (the image you have of yourself) as well as self-esteem (how you feel about yourself). When your inner critic is constantly putting yourself down, it's nearly impossible to view yourself in a positive light.
 
Since work is often performance-based (behaving a certain way, meeting job expectations, interacting with others), it is not surprising that self-hatred can impact your work life. When you feel worthless or incapable, you may be less likely to take on projects or find it difficult to work collaboratively with others. You may feel resentment toward coworkers or put yourself down for lack of performance.
 
It can be extremely difficult to make and maintain friendships when you are burdened with constant and relentless negative self-talk and self-loathing. To avoid the pain of criticism, judgment, or abandonment, you may even resist meeting new people. Or you may come off as cold or uncaring, which can prevent you from getting close to others.
 
Since a significant influence on self-hatred comes from past social experiences like abuse and trauma, family dynamics can feel very complicated for someone struggling with self-hatred. You may be in a situation that requires you to be in contact with someone from your painful past, causing distress and a tendency to withdraw in an effort to avoid experiencing painful memories and emotions.
 
Even if you are not dealing with a traumatic family history, your perfectionist mindset and unrealistic expectations of self can get in the way of being able to enjoy family interactions.﻿﻿ The pressure to ""performing perfectly"" in those settings can become too much and prevent you from forming and/or enjoying family connections.
 
Romantic relationships can feel complicated and confusing for someone who experiences self-hatred. You may fight the idea of closeness and intimacy.
 
Even if you long to feel close, the fear of someone seeing your perceived imperfections, limitations, or lack of value can be overwhelming and stand in the way of a meaningful relationship.﻿﻿ The inner critic is painful enough, but the thought of someone close to you seeing or thinking those things about you can feel devastating.
 
Self-hatred tells us that we are not capable and will likely fail or fall short—and this type of thinking can make goals, desires, and dreams feel distant and impossible. You may look at others and think they are getting it right, while you suffer from constant self-critical statements. Living this way is emotionally exhausting and can result in a lack of desire to set goals at all.
 
Negative self-talk and self-loathing can hijack or paralyze decision-making abilities. When you see yourself in such a negative way, you may feel less willing to take risks that will help you grow. You may pull away from opportunities to connect with others and find yourself stuck in a pattern of self-doubt.
 
Living with self-hatred is overwhelming, exhausting, and isolating. Luckily, there are steps we can take to quiet that inner critic, calm the negative storm, and move forward in positive ways.
 
If you struggle with self-hatred, your inner critic might feel relentless and you may begin believing your inner dialogue's hateful narrative. When this happens, it is helpful to try to slow yourself down and distinguish feelings from fact.
 
Identifying your strengths can help quiet self-hatred. If you find it difficult to come up with some on your own, consider asking others for help. It is almost always easier to recognize someone else's strengths rather than our own.
 
If you view yourself in a hateful way, it's hard to take a compliment. It may even feel foreign and uncomfortable and so you'll dismiss it or minimize to avoid feeling vulnerable.
 
Learning how to accept a compliment will take practice, but it is possible. The next time someone compliments you, try saying ""thank you""—and stop there. Resist the urge to follow it up with a self-critical or dismissive response.
 
People who struggle with self-hatred often have little or no compassion toward themselves. In fact, the idea of having self-compassion can feel impossible or confusing. A great way to think of self-compassion is to think about how you would treat a friend or loved one. Would you beat them up for making a mistake or remind them that no one is perfect?
 
Psychologist and self-compassion researcher Kristin Neff, PhD, explains: ""Instead of mercilessly judging and criticizing yourself for various inadequacies or shortcomings, self-compassion means you are kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings. After all, whoever said you were supposed to be perfect?""
 
Self-hatred is often focused on the past—a painful moment or emotion like shame or guilt, anger or embarrassment, or a sense of powerlessness. In that space, there is no room to forgive ourselves or embrace who we are.
 
Do your best to stay in the present and focus on how far you have come. This may feel uncomfortable or different, but over time, it will help you to decrease self-hatred and gain self-compassion.
 
Remember that stopping self-hatred takes time. It might feel challenging and impossible at times. You may even find yourself grieving this all too familiar part of you, which is okay. When you allow yourself to let go of the negative critic, you make room for more joy, peace, and connection in your life.

The healthiest approach to self-improvement is the one that works best for you—but how can you know which one that will be? Truthfully, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to self-improvement, so you may need to engage in a bit of trial and error to find what is most helpful for your situation. At the same time, effective self-improvement journeys usually have ten basic features that you should keep in mind.
 
There are no quick fixes when it comes to self-improvement. Focus on self-improvement approaches that involve a gradual change to increase your odds of success.﻿﻿ These approaches typically have you focus on one change at a time, and you only move on to the next change when you've become comfortable with the earlier change in your life.
 
Gradual self-improvement usually also breaks things down into easier steps, just like in high school or college when you would break down your assignments into more manageable chunks.
 
For example, simply planning to go to the gym three times a week to improve your mental health might feel like too big of a step at the beginning. Instead, a gradual plan might have you choose clothes to wear to the gym, choose days and times you will go, and plan out your workouts in advance so that you don't feel overwhelmed once you get there.
 
Another way self-improvement can be gradual is to think of the smallest change that you can make in a positive direction, or how to improve by just one percent at a time. For example, if you want to become a more social person, you might make a point of introducing yourself to one new person each month.
 
An even better change to implement would be one that does not require ongoing effort from you but rather a one-time implementation—for example, joining a club that meets every Wednesday means getting out and being social without having to put effort into figuring out new plans and new people to meet every week or month.
 
There is little point in embarking on a self-improvement quest if you don't have a goal in mind. However, it is important that you choose a goal that is compelling for you and that also feels attainable.
 
This often means starting with a big, ""dream"" goal and working backward from there to identify smaller goals along the path toward that big goal. Having a set of goals will keep you motivated at times that you feel like quitting.﻿﻿
 
The best self-improvement plans will involve a commitment on your part. The ideal way to set that commitment is to write it down or make a verbal promise to someone close to you—an accountability partner of sorts.﻿﻿
 
Below is an example of an accountability statement:
 
""I am making a commitment to my mental health by meditating for five minutes each morning and repeating a positive affirmation to myself after the meditation is complete. This is part of a larger goal I have to include more mindfulness in my life. I want to do this to help prepare myself for each day, to remind myself that I am capable of achieving what I want, and to reduce stress.""
 
Obstacles will always arise when you have made plans and goals. Staying on track requires identifying the obstacles that you are likely to face and having a plan to deal with them.
 
In this way, the best self-improvement approaches incorporate awareness that things will not always go smoothly and that you must be able to adjust accordingly. They will also have you list out coping strategies to deal with those obstacles in a concrete way.
 
Beyond the reward of improving yourself, many self-improvement approaches incorporate some form of reward for behavior.﻿﻿
 
The common example would be rewarding weight loss with a non-food reward; in the area of mental wellness, rewards for sticking to a self-help regime could include anything that motivates you—it is up to you to figure out what that is.
 
Perhaps most importantly, the healthiest self-improvement approaches will be grounded in research evidence. While it may be tempting to follow ""gurus"" who promise miracle cures, approaches that have been back by well-controlled research trials are the ones most likely to show a benefit.
 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are a good example. There is robust research evidence supporting the effectiveness of CBT, so you can use this approach comfortable in the knowledge that it has been shown to work.﻿﻿
 
If you are interested in learning more about changes you can make based on research evidence, Richard Wiseman's book ""59 Seconds"" converts research into practice with tips on how to change your life in under a minute.
 
Regardless of how well-researched an approach is, if it is not a good fit for you, you won't find it helpful. Each of us has a unique situation in terms of personality, culture, etc. that will influence our choice of self-improvement approaches—and rightly so. What works for your neighbor is not necessarily going to work for you.
 
This often comes down to a gut feeling or your level of comfort with a particular approach. If you are artistic, you might find art therapy approaches such as coloring mandalas enjoyable. If you are more a numbers person, you might enjoy approaches that have you tracking behaviors or measuring success in some tangible form. You can figure this out through trial and error or self-assess and try to match up with self-improvement that aligns with your personal traits.
 
Unless you are working with a therapist or coach, it will be up to you to make a plan for your self-improvement. This is hard to do if you don't first have self-awareness about what is wrong and what you are trying to change.
 
Usually, self-awareness takes place in three areas: physical, cognitive, and emotional. When you are able to recognize the areas in which you are struggling, and have compassion for yourself, you will be better able to make a plan for change. In this way, the healthiest self-improvement plans will involve a step in which you sit down and get self-aware.
 
For example, if you struggle with disorganization in your life, before embarking on a plan for self-improvement, you might want to identify the thoughts you have (e.g., I am a messy person), how they make you feel (e.g., I will never get organized), and how that plays out for you physically (e.g., I feel tired all the time, I am lacking the energy to get started). Being compassionate toward yourself will enable you to make a plan to fix these problems.
 
The healthiest self-improvement approaches will give you concrete steps or an action plan for achieving your goals. It is not enough to identify goals—without an action plan to reach those goals you will be left languishing.
 
Life coaches or wellness coaches are particularly suited to helping you create an action plan for self-improvement. This could involve creating an overall plan that incorporates various strategies such as mindfulness, exercise, and cognitive restructuring (reworking your thoughts to improve your mental health).
 
A self-improvement approach that makes you optimistic is often the healthiest path to take. Typically, approaches that incorporate some form of positive self-talk, mindfulness, and self-awareness are more likely to cultivate optimism. Approaches based on the branch of psychology known as positive psychology focus on this aspect of self-improvement. If you're wanting to focus on optimism, choose a self-improvement approach from this domain.
 
In addition to the above ten qualities of a healthy self-improvement approach, the plan that you develop should always allow for readjustment along the way. By reflecting on past successes and mistakes, you will be able to evaluate what went well and what went wrong, how you can do things differently in the future, and where you still have room for growth.
 
Finally, remember that any movement in a positive direction is progress no matter how small or how long it takes. It is better to follow a plan for self-improvement that has the above qualities and takes a bit more time than to try for a quick cure. The time and effort you invest will be rewarded in the end.

"
We all have periods of time when we feel less energetic and struggle to find motivation. It is common to feel this way on occasion but, when these moments start becoming more frequent or last for longer periods of time, we might start seeing ourselves differently. Our goals become less important, we find it difficult to feel inspired and we might start wondering if we are capable. We may even start calling ourselves lazy.
 
We all have a sense of who we want to be, how we want to behave, goals we want to accomplish, and how we want to show up in the world. The ideal self is a concept in psychology that refers to the image we carry in our minds of what our best self would look, act, and feel like. Our ideal self is often an image of productivity and our achievement of certain goals, healthy behaviors, and more.﻿﻿ Unfortunately, our busy lives don't often allow for much reflection on our ideal self and it seems to get lost in the shuffle, tucked away somewhere with our childhood answers to ""What do you want to be when you grow up?""
 
If you feel lazy or unproductive at times, you are certainly not alone. Recent polls have indicated that 80% of people who set a New Year's resolution will fail to achieve their intended goal.﻿﻿ What is it that makes it so difficult to hang in there, stay productive and work toward our desired goals?
 
There are many things that can get in the way of our productivity and achievement of goals, leaving us to see ourselves as ""lazy."" Sometimes the obstacles are situational or related to timing and opportunity, while other times we may be creating the obstacles ourselves with our approach, our mindset, or our methods.
 
In order to make real progress and quit our old ""lazy"" patterns, we need to recognize what might be influencing our inability to reach our goals or leaving us feeling less productive than we would like to be. So, what you might think of as ""lazy,"" may just be a matter of switching up your approach and getting rid of old, unhelpful habits that have kept you from feeling productive and achieving your goals.
 
Here are several such habits that can prevent us from reaching our goals. If anything on this list looks familiar, don't worry—you are far from alone:
 
Fortunately, there are plenty of achievable steps you can take to turn things around or stay on track with your goals:
 
Our feelings of laziness can also be influenced by how we are taking care of ourselves physically. We can learn new goal-setting habits and work to challenge our negative thought patterns, but we also need to consider what we are doing for our bodies. Taking care of our physical health can help set the stage for increased energy which, in turn, can allow us to put these other positive changes into action.﻿﻿
 
What we eat plays a significant role in how energetic we feel. When our schedules don't allow much time for food planning and preparation, we might find ourselves reaching for quick options on the go, options that offer little nutritional value to help us maintain adequate energy levels. Foods higher in protein, for example, can help our bodies to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and keep us from feeling drastic ups and downs in our energy throughout the day.﻿﻿
 
Examples of food and drink that can help increase energy include:
 
Examples of food and drink to avoid if you want increased energy include:
 
Although sugary foods can give us a temporary boost of energy, it is very short-lived and can leave us feeling as if our energy levels have bottomed out. The timing of our meals and snacks can impact our energy levels as well. Eating smaller meals through the day can help us maintain steady levels of energy, compared to eating larger, heavier meals that often leave us feeling tired.﻿﻿
 
When we are tired and feeling lazy, the last thing we likely want to do is exercise. However, moving our bodies can help increase our energy levels and overall feelings of productivity. Research has shown that even just low to moderate levels of exercise can have a significant impact on our energy levels, helping to reduce fatigue.﻿﻿
 
Ways to incorporate more exercise can include:
 
Our sleep patterns can greatly impact our energy levels. If you tend to feel lazy, you might think you are getting too much sleep at night or find yourself taking extended naps during the day. Creating a healthy sleep routine can help you maintain a consistent sleep schedule and, in turn, help you feel more balanced and energized to take on tasks and feel more productive.﻿﻿ If you are a night owl or a napper, this transition could take some work. However, being able to start your day with increased energy, and being able to maintain your energy levels through the day, make the sleep routine worthwhile.
 
What to consider in your sleep care routine:
 
Being constantly overscheduled, with demands placed on us in multiple areas of our lives, can leave us feeling physically and emotionally drained. In these moments we can find it difficult to take active steps and make decisions because we are exhausted. Feelings of exhaustion can leave us feeling as if we are lazy when we are actually stressed and overwhelmed.
 
According to the American Psychological Association, some helpful ways to manage your stress include things like:﻿﻿
 
A significant element of stress management is making sure we are using our time wisely. It can be easy to say ""yes"" to our co-workers, our spouse, our children, and friends. So easy, in fact, that you may find yourself unable to actually fulfill all of what you have committed to.﻿﻿ Look at where you are spending your time, take inventory of unfinished tasks on your to-do list, consider where you can politely say ""no"" so that you can use that time for things that need your attention and energy.
 
If the idea of setting boundaries is new to you, the first couple of steps would include giving yourself permission to do it and to start with small things. You may be afraid of how people will respond to you and that is okay. Remember that your goal here is to improve self-care, increase energy and feel empowered to tackle the tasks and goals that are important to you. Creating time for yourself is key and setting small boundaries around your time will help you do just that.
 
Lastly, when we feel lazy it is natural to look around and think everyone else is getting it right except you. Don't allow yourself to get caught in the distraction of comparing yourself to others.﻿﻿ Remember, our inner critic is a roadblock to our productivity and can keep us feeling stuck. Allow yourself to show up differently in your life and remember that the journey is uniquely yours.
 
Taking small steps toward better self-care, increased energy, improved goals, and healthy boundary setting can help you stop feeling lazy in no time. Prioritizing and taking consistent action steps are the key to long-term change and there is no better time than now to take those first steps.
 Making your goals too big or complicated. We all want to reach the pinnacle, but we might grossly underestimate how much effort and time it takes to get up there.﻿﻿ If we give up after a few hours, it's not because we are lazy but because we may have realized we miscalculated the amount of time and effort involved. Expecting yourself to be perfect. When we are working toward a goal we expect the road to be smooth and consistent when, in reality, the path toward our goal is most likely going to be full of twists, turns, and setbacks.﻿﻿ Listening to your inner critic. If the term ""lazy"" is part of your self-talk, there are likely more negative and critical statements that come from your inner critic on a regular basis. You may even bring out your inner critic in an attempt to motivate yourself. What happens? Your critical voice focuses on all of your flaws and shortcomings, rather than any existing strengths and positive attributes that could help you move forward.﻿﻿ Listening to criticism from others. As we learn about ourselves and the world through our experiences, we are receiving feedback from others that helps to shape our self-concept. When someone important to us has called us lazy in the past, it can really impact how we see ourselves even into adulthood. We may also hear people criticize our efforts in our adult life, leaving us to feel self-doubt or discouragement.﻿﻿ Not creating a plan of action. When we find inspiration and become excited about a new goal, we can forget the importance of creating a plan. Our excitement for the goal can cause us to move fast and with a lot of passion, but turn into a sense of being overwhelmed and feeling aimless.﻿﻿ Create small, attainable goals. You can still desire to reach the pinnacle, but break that huge goal down into smaller goals that will help you feel more accomplished and motivated to continue climbing. As you consider the big picture, remember the key steps that will be needed to get there and write them down. If needed, break those down into even smaller or shorter-term goals.  Take time to develop a plan. Sit with yourself for a moment as you reflect on your desires and goals, considering those small and attainable steps you will need to accomplish in order to get there. Be realistic about the amount of effort, time, money, help or other factors involved in meeting this goal. Going into the process with an action plan will help you feel more confident and peaceful, as well as give you something to refer back to when you feel discouraged or have a setback. Focus on your strengths. If you are used to an inner critic that focuses on your flaws and shortcomings, you will find great benefit in taking inventory of your strengths.﻿﻿ Do you find it hard to think of any personal strengths? Consider any challenge you have been through and reflect on what personal strengths you used to get through that experience. If you still find it difficult to identify strengths, ask friends or family what they see as your greatest strength. You can also find strengths assessments online, such as the Values In Action inventory. Celebrate the small victories. Celebrating your victories as you accomplish the small goals, or even as you overcome setbacks, can help you continue moving forward.﻿﻿ The pride we experience in meeting our goals can help reinforce more positive self-talk. We experience increased self-efficacy with each accomplishment, which can help us find long-term success. Recruit support. It is okay to ask for help along the way. We thrive when connected to important people in a positive, healthy way. Allow those important support people to be a part of your experience. You may want them to celebrate with you along the way or may want to turn to them in times of need when you experience a setback or obstacle. Finding reassurance and encouragement from important people in our lives can help us develop greater resiliency.

"
Sometimes, it’s hard to be happy when you think about what’s going on in the world. It’s harder still when the people around you constantly complain about all those things that are happening.
 
That doesn’t mean that you have to join ranks with the pessimists, though. In fact, it means it’s more important than ever to look on the bright side as much as possible.
 
Choosing to be optimistic offers surprising benefits. A study from the University of Pittsburgh concluded that women who had an optimistic outlook had a 30 percent lower risk of heart disease.﻿﻿
 
A University of Michigan study linked optimism to a lower risk of stroke.﻿﻿ Additionally, research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that optimists are less likely to experience disabilities as they get older and end up living longer than pessimists.﻿﻿
 
If you think you’re a natural-born pessimist and there’s no way you can turn your mindset around, think again—research published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry compared two groups of people to test their thinking patterns.﻿﻿
 
The first group completed a 5-minute exercise that involved thinking positive thoughts about their future, while the second group just went about their daily lives without making effort to think optimistically. The first group significantly increased their optimism over the two-week period, with many of them feeling more optimistic after just one day.
 
If you want to become a more optimistic person—despite the negativity surrounding you—then you can take measures to think positively and spread that optimistic outlook to those around you.
 
You have choices in your life. You can spend the day cleaning or spend the day reading. You can go out to dinner or cook at home. You can have coffee with that long-lost friend or you can blow them off.
 
And, finally, you can decide to be positive or you can just go on living like you are. Being an optimistic person in a negative world begins with the decision to be positive and choosing to live that life every single day.
 
You might refer to them as “whiners” or even “toxic,” but however you refer to them, pessimists suck the positive energy out of the room. These people think the world revolves around them, and they often lack any sense of empathy for others.
 
It’s important to establish healthy boundaries with people who chronically choose to stay stuck in their own misery. That may mean having to say things to a friend like, “I notice every time I offer you an idea about how you could make your situation better, you insist nothing will work. I am not sure I’m able to help.”
 
It may also mean distancing yourself a bit from a relative who insists on sharing his latest predictions about the end of the world.
 
Limit your media intake as well. Watching too many tragic stories on the news or consuming too much political news on social media can decrease your ability to maintain a “glass half full” outlook.﻿﻿
 
It’s OK to acknowledge that bad things might happen. After all, ignoring reality isn’t helpful.
 
In fact, being realistic could be the key to doing your best. If you’re excessively positive about an upcoming interview, you might not spend any time preparing because you’re confident you’ll land the job.
 
If however, you have an exaggeratedly negative outlook, you might sabotage your chances of getting hired. Thinking, “No one will ever hire me,” will cause you to look and feel defeated when you walk into the interview room. Your lack of confidence may be the reason you don’t get hired.
 
A healthy outlook would be to remind yourself that all you can do is your best and you’ll be OK, regardless of the outcome. Being optimistic helps you believe that brighter opportunities are on the horizon and you’re able to put in the effort to earn those opportunities.
 
When you’re thinking negatively, take a moment to assess how realistic your thoughts truly are. Reframing your exaggeratedly negative thoughts into more realistic statements can help you maintain a healthy dose of optimism.﻿﻿
 
While it’s not your job to make everyone happy, it doesn’t hurt to perk up someone’s day. Once a day, share positive feedback with someone.
 
At work, compliment someone about a good question raised in an email or salient points that they brought up in an important meeting.
 
At home, praise your child for how hard they worked on their math homework. Or, tell your partner how much you appreciate them.
 
Making other people feel positive has lasting effects on your own life.﻿﻿ With that, don’t forget to bestow positivity on yourself. Before bed, think about what you did during the day. Even if it was a generally lackluster day, there’s bound to be something you can praise yourself for, whether it was keeping your cool when a driver cuts you off or wrapping up a project that has really been a challenge for you.
 
It sounds kitschy, but writing down your ideas of an optimistic future can truly make a difference when it comes to your overall outlook.
 
If you need a primer, here’s what to do: Spend 20 minutes on four consecutive days on writing down what you want to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year—feel free to dream big.
 
You can also consider a serious challenge you have in your life right now and think about possible positive outcomes.
 
Thinking about all the things you have to be grateful for, from warm sunshine to clean water, can give you an instant boost of optimism. You might even decide to keep a gratitude journal, in which you write down everything that makes you crack a smile during the day.﻿﻿
 
If nothing else, take a moment to stop, smile and be grateful for the good things in your life. Savor the moments that make it possible for you to have a good life.
 
It’s hard to be optimistic without feeling gratitude toward those that helped you get to that happy place. While thinking about how grateful you are is helpful, sharing your gratitude with others provides added benefits. You’ll spread a bit of joy and cheer when you tell others how much you appreciate them.
 
Write a letter to someone who made a positive impact on your life, whether it’s a teacher, a former boss or even your mom. If possible, deliver that letter in person.

Can you learn how to think positive? You have probably heard a thing or two about the benefits of positive thinking. Research suggests that positive thinkers have better stress coping skills, stronger immunity, and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. While it is not a health panacea, taking an optimistic view rather than ruminating on negative thoughts can benefit your overall mental well-being.
 
So what can you do to become a more positive thinker? A few common strategies involve learning how to identify negative thoughts and replacing these thoughts with more positive ones. While it might take some time, eventually you may find that thinking positively starts to come more naturally.
 
Here are four things you can do to think positive.
 
Self-talk involves the things you mentally tell yourself. Think of this as the inner voice inside your mind that analyzes how you perform and interact with the world around you. If your self-talk centers on negative thoughts, your self-esteem can suffer.
 
So what can you do to combat these negative self-talk patterns? One way to break the pattern is to start noticing when you have these thoughts and then actively work to change them.
 When you start thinking critical thoughts about yourself, take a moment to pause and assess. 
Paying attention to your self-talk is a great place to start when trying to think more positively. If you notice that you tend to engage in negative self-talk, you can start looking for ways to change your thought patterns and reframe your interpretations of your own behaviors.
 
Stress management expert Elizabeth Scott advises people to start by noticing their thought patterns and then focus on changing these into more positive ones. When you catch yourself engaging in a negative thought, mentally telling yourself to ""Stop"" can help break the pattern.
 
It can be tough to stay optimistic when there is little humor or lightheartedness in your life. Even when you are facing challenges, it is important to remain open to laughter and fun.
 
Sometimes, simply recognizing the potential humor in a situation can lessen your stress and brighten your outlook. Seeking out sources of humor such as watching a funny sitcom or reading jokes online can help you think more positive thoughts.
 
Learning to think positively is like strengthening a muscle; the more you use it, the stronger it will become. Researchers believe that your explanatory style, or how you explain events, is linked to whether you are an optimist or a pessimist.﻿﻿
 Optimists tend to have a positive explanatory style. If you attribute good things that happen to your skill and effort, then you are probably an optimist. 
Pessimists, on the other hand, usually have a negative attributional style. If you credit these good events to outside forces, then you likely have a more pessimistic way of thinking.
 
The same principles hold true for how you explain negative events. Optimists tend to view bad or unfortunate events as isolated incidents that are outside of their control while pessimists see such things as more common and often blame themselves.
 
By taking a moment to analyze the event and ensure that you are giving yourself the credit you are due for the good things and not blaming yourself for things outside of your control, you can start to become more optimistic.
 
There is no on-off switch for positive thinking. Even if you are a natural-born optimist, thinking positively when faced with challenging situations can be difficult. Like any goal, the key is to stick with it for the long-term. Even if you find yourself dwelling on negative thoughts, you can look for ways to minimize negative self-talk and cultivate a more optimistic outlook.
 
Finally, do not be afraid to enlist the help of friends and family.
 When you start engaging in negative thinking, call a friend or family member who you can count on to offer positive encouragement and feedback. 
Remember that to think positively, you need to nurture yourself. Investing energy in things you enjoy and surrounding yourself with optimistic people are just two ways that you can encourage positive thinking in your life.
 
Learning how to think positive is not a quick fix, and it is something that may take some time to master. Analyzing your own thinking habits and finding new ways to incorporate a more positive outlook into your life can be a great start toward adopting a more positive thinking approach.

The differences among us lie not only in the shape hardship takes but also in how we respond to it. Do you find yourself weighed down by your seemingly unlucky lot in life? Or do you embrace the struggle?
 
Resilience is the ability to cope with adversity and to use challenges to forge strength and prosperity. Having resilience does not mean that you don’t struggle, make mistakes, or need to ask for help. Resilient people keep plugging along even when the situation becomes ugly or exhausting. They learn from their mishaps and misfortunes, and they rely on others with confidence and trust.
 Even when tragedy strikes, growth is possible. The positive changes that result from a traumatic experience are called post-traumatic growth. These changes can include a deeper appreciation for life, a bolstered sense of one’s own capabilities, and stronger connections to others. 
Whether the struggles you face are traumas or everyday setbacks, being resilient will help you gain greater control over your own path and cultivate positive change. These four strategies can build your resilience reserves.
 
Resilient people find a way to explain their situations in a more positive light while still accepting reality. Imagine a news broadcast interviewing victims of a natural disaster a year later. Some brood: “We’ll never get our lives back.” Others find the silver lining: “This was the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, but this community has come together and shown its strength in so many unbelievable ways.”
 
We have the ability to decide how we’re going to interpret the adversities we face. When we work to find an appreciation for what we've gained as we persevere, we develop a more grateful approach to living. The hardship that scars us also grants us wisdom.
 When all you see is negative, broaden your perspective by asking yourself, “What good has come about as a result of this adversity?” 
Optimists are among the most resilient of us, and they succeed by virtue of focusing their attention on how they can make their situations better. When faced with a challenge, pessimistic thinkers are more likely to be blind to opportunities to enact positive changes. In short, they adopt a victim mentality.
 
Optimists maintain a more accurate view of the control they do have. Consider Admiral James Stockdale’s trials as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. The Stockdale Paradox, a term coined by author Jim Collins, is the recipe for resilience that combines a harsh and objective assessment of reality (“Being a prisoner of war is awful”) with confidence and faith that drive hope (“This will get better and I can make it better”). Despite being stuck in solitary confinement, Stockdale and his fellow prisoners developed a system of tapping to communicate with one another. Once they could communicate, they could support each other.﻿﻿
 
Realistic optimism identifies points of control—in this case, the ability to communicate—and takes advantage of them. Resilience is the act of taking a step forward despite dire circumstances. When we look critically for something we can control, we lay out the path for ourselves. 
 When you feel stuck or bogged down in adversity, find one thing you have control over and take action on it. 
There are many images in our culture of the self-reliant, lone hero whose personal willpower provides enough strength to withstand any obstacle.
 
But while personal strength matters a lot, it is ultimately a sense of community that enables true resilience. Studies of children undergoing significant hardship find that kids who have one adult in their lives who provide stability and support are much more likely to do well than kids who don’t. The ability to relate and process one’s struggles in the context of a safe relationship buffer against many of the potential negative effects of childhood trauma.﻿﻿
 
And relationship benefits extend to adults. Consider Stockdale and his fellow prisoners. Their communication system fostered a ""we're in this together"" mindset.﻿﻿ Knowing that there’s someone else out there who cares is invaluable when we’re facing a hardship.
 Tending to your most important relationships when times are good builds the trust and intimacy that will help those relationships stay strong when adversity hits. 
Failure is hard for many of us to take. We’d rather step back from a challenging situation than risk making a fool of ourselves. But when we adopt the perspective that challenge can strengthen us, and that we can learn from both successes and failures, we’re exercising our resilience muscles.
 
This is not to say that we should seek adversity. But finding small, manageable ways to challenge yourself builds confidence. Take that class you’ve been interested in. Make that phone call you’ve been avoiding. Push your limits little by little and adopt a view of exploration and curiosity. Whether you soar or crash and burn, you’re gaining knowledge and insight.
 Identifying with the process of trying, rather than outcomes, is a resilience-building approach to life. 
Everyone has varying levels of resilience, but it is a skill you can work to build. Put in the effort to develop it before you encounter hardship, and you'll be able to meet challenges and learn from them.
 
If you're struggling to deal with a traumatic event or adverse experience, seek professional help. You may be at risk for developing an adjustment disorder, or PTSD, without professional intervention. A therapist can assist you in reducing your risk, increasing your resilience, and managing your distress in a healthy way.

Hedonic adaptation, also known as “the hedonic treadmill,” is a concept studied by positive psychology researchers and others who focus on happiness and well-being that refers to people’s general tendency to return to a set level of happiness despite life’s ups and downs.﻿﻿
 Hedonic adaptation is often referred to as “the hedonic treadmill” because we always end up where we started. 
There are several different ways that hedonic adaptation has been observed, and here are a few interesting examples:﻿﻿
 
Many researchers have examined the hedonic treadmill phenomenon and have attempted to determine how much of our happiness is really under our control. Researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky has examined this set-point and come up with a specific percentage: 40 percent.﻿﻿
 A full 50% of our happiness set-point, her research determined, is due to genetics, while 10% is affected primarily by circumstances like where we were born and to whom. This leaves 40% that is subject to our influence. 
Other researchers have come up with slightly different numbers, but all have been roughly in this ballpark.
 
Certain activities are more subject to hedonic adaptation—the happiness that they bring dissipates more quickly. Some of these activities are known by researchers and psychologists as “pleasures,” which can bring quick bursts of—you guessed it—pleasure, which can also lead to longer-term happiness.
 
Researcher Martin Seligman, one of the pioneers in this field, explained pleasures this way:﻿﻿
 
""The pleasures are delights that have clear sensory and strong emotional components, what philosophers call 'raw feels': ecstasy, thrills…delight, mirth, exuberance, and comfort. They are evanescent, and they involve little, if any, thinking.""
 
These pleasures can lift your mood and leave you feeling wonderful, but their effects can be relatively fleeting. What’s more, we get used to them relatively quickly.
 
If you have the same meal every day for a week, for example, you'll likely find it to be less pleasurable by the end of the week. This is true for roller-coaster rides, fresh flowers, drinking tea, listening to a favorite song, watching videos of adorable animals, and many other pleasures. However, there are ways to prolong the enjoyment of life’s pleasures, and they’re well worth including in your life.
 
Seligman also researched gratifications, which are activities that get us into a feeling of “flow” where we don’t notice the passage of time, where we’re thoroughly engaged in what we’re doing, and sort of lost in the activity.﻿﻿
 
This effect occurs most easily when we face a challenge that’s both fun and the right kind of challenge for our abilities: not too difficult lest we feel discouraged but just difficult enough to keep us feeling challenged. Gratifications, as well as activities that present a strong sense of meaning to us, are more immune to the effects of hedonic adaptation.
 Interestingly, the more we engage in gratifications, the more we enjoy them. 
These are activities that require more effort and thought, but the payoff is higher as well. The more we engage, the more we enjoy.﻿﻿ Gratifications include activities that are often thought of as hobbies, like creating art, learning a skill like karate, or even engaging in an activity like meditation. Most, if not all, gratifications can be great stress relievers.
 
Knowing that pleasures are fleeting in their effects may make them seem less worth the effort than other activities like gratifications that can bring more lasting results. There are reasons why they can be perfect for certain situations.
 
First, as mentioned earlier, they bring a quick lift in mood without a great deal of effort. This mood boost is actually quite valuable because there is significant research that shows that a lift in mood can lead to a chain reaction of positive feelings and increased resilience.
 
Basically, pleasures can create an ""upward spiral of positivity,"" and this can lead to greater happiness and resilience to stress. For the little effort they require, this is a pretty big payoff.﻿﻿
 
Second, gratifications do take more effort, so when you only have a few minutes or a very limited amount of energy, pleasures are often the simpler and more accessible option. For example, if you’re running errands and feeling stressed, it’s often easier to drink some nice tea as you rush (which can be pleasant and diminish stress) than getting out some painting supplies and honing your craft.
 Even if you may benefit more from the gratification of painting than the pleasure of tea, sometimes you may only have time for tea. That’s certainly better than nothing. 
Meaningful activities like volunteering for a good cause or helping a friend, incidentally, seem to carry great benefits as well. Seligman found that these may take a significant amount of energy and may not always be enjoyable while a person is engaged in them (they can be challenging), but they bring lasting results in terms of overall happiness and inner peace.
 
Altruism really does have many benefits to the giver as well as the recipients. Meaningful acts should not be overlooked, particularly because they seem to transcend the hedonic treadmill quite effectively.
 
Hedonic adaptation is a fact of life, but when we are aware of how it works and how it functions in our lives, we are more able to work around the negatives and engage in activities that are more immune to the stifling effects of the hedonic treadmill.﻿﻿
 
The following are some ways in which you can move away from the limiting effects of hedonic adaptation and engage in activities that can actually create a greater level of happiness in your life:﻿﻿
 
Hedonic adaptation—that old hedonic treadmill that we're all on—is part of us (and it keeps us grounded) but we can still increase our happiness set point by working pleasures, gratifications, and meaningful activities into our lives by engaging in the right activities at the right time.
 
If you’re someone who is naturally happy, this focus on the positive can help you to feel happier than you would. If you’re someone who’s naturally less happy or who faces a lot of challenges, this extra attention to minimizing hedonic adaptation can help you to live a more fulfilling life.
 People who win the lottery tend to return to roughly their original levels of happiness after the novelty of the win has worn off. (Some even end up less happy because of changes in relationships that can occur.) There is an initial influx of joy, of course, but after about a year, people in their day-to-day lives experience the same general sense of happiness. The same is true for those who are in major accidents and lose the use of their legs. The change in ability can be devastating at first, but people generally tend to return to their pre-accident levels of happiness after the habituation period. Research has found that the first bite of something delicious is experienced as more pleasurable than the third or the tenth. People become accustomed to the pleasure rather quickly and soon, the same mood-lifting little treat doesn’t bring the same influx of joy. Be sure your life includes several pleasures, and try to plan for them throughout your day. Get that cup of coffee. Call that friend for a quick laugh. If you feel you don’t have time for too many of these pleasures, aim to organize your time with the specific intention of including them. Rotate your pleasures so that they always feel new. Just as fresh sheets feel more wonderful than your week-old sheets, a rotation of pleasures is more enjoyable than the same ones for days in a row. (This may be different if you enjoy the ritual of certain activities, but it’s generally true. When you become slightly bored with your pleasures begin to vary them.) Be sure you make time for hobbies. If you plan a class once a week, this is one of the most effective ways to benefit from gratifications. You’re sharing what you enjoy with others, you’re putting it on your calendar so you’re more likely to make time for it, and you’re able to deepen your abilities and watch yourself grow. It doesn’t really matter what the hobby is. As long as it’s one that you enjoy, you’ll benefit from it, and these benefits will extend into the rest of your life. Find time for others. This creates greater meaning in your life, and that can create greater happiness. Just as gratifications can work outside of the hedonic treadmill and help you increase your overall levels of happiness, meaningful activities can create these changes as well. Savor your positive experiences. This is a great way to enjoy life more without needing anything else to change. It just takes a bit of focused attention and the effects of pleasures, gratifications, and meaningful activities can all expand. Keep a journal. One way to maximize the impact of your positive experiences is to write down the things you enjoyed that day. Aim for three a day. You'll be reliving these positive experiences as you write about them, and can relive them again when you read through your journal. Keep an eye on your happiness levels. If you feel that you could be happier, make time for whatever you can do to lift your mood. Do what makes you happy and/or try something new.",hedonic adaptation also know hedonic treadmill concept study positive psychology researchers others focus happiness well refer people general

While there’s more to happiness than just the absence of stress, there are relationships between stress-relieving activities and happiness. Positive psychology pioneer Martin Seligman has researched and written extensively about ""authentic happiness"", which is facilitated and enhanced by all of those things you may instinctively know are good for the soul: strong relationships, challenging work, and meaning in life. 
 
Dr. Michael Frisch, a Baylor University professor and another pioneer in the field of positive psychology, has found 16 different areas of life that contribute to a person’s happiness, and measuring satisfaction in these areas can help measure a person’s overall level of happiness and life satisfaction.
 Many of the things that bring happiness are also things that relieve stress, such as exercise, expressing creativity, maintaining supportive friendships, keeping an organized home, and enjoying your work. 
When you’re overwhelmed with stress, often just relieving the imminent pressures is foremost on your mind; however, following a stress relief program that also incorporates activities known to increase overall happiness can give you short-term stress relief, and the lasting gains of a happy life. And when you incorporate into your life a general state of happiness and make habit the lifestyle features that promote it, you’ll be better able to weather future stress in your life.
 
The following is a list of the 16 different features that promote happiness, with resources from this site and others that can help you incorporate these features into your life, relieving stress at the same time!
 Health: Maintain your health, and you're maintaining your happiness. Health issues can bring additional stress and can make it difficult for you to do some of the things that bring you happiness and stress relief. Self-Esteem: Feeling good about who you are isn't just a touchy-feely thing we worry about for our kids; it's important for you to like the person you are right now. Low self-esteem seems to affect many areas of your life. Goals, Values, and Spiritual Life: These are three different things, but they make up an important category that involves an internal, positive focus on something that's greater than who you are right now. These are all things that bring meaning to your life, and this is closely tied to your happiness. Money: It's true that, beyond a certain point, more money doesn't bring significantly more happiness. It's also true, however, that too little money can bring stress and challenges to your happiness. Having enough money to live comfortably is important.  Work: Having a job that fulfills you is ideal. A job that doesn't make you miserable is a must. Play: Leisure time, having fun, letting loose--they're all important for your happiness and stress levels. You don't need to play all of the time, but you really need some time for fun in your life. Learning: Taking on new skills and growing as a person involves gratifications, and can provide you with greater resources in your life--both great for stress and happiness. Creativity: The same is true for expressing your creativity. In fact, art activities that exercise creativity have been shown to be good for the health and happiness of those who consider themselves to be non-creative types as well. Helping: It turns out that we as humans really love to be helpful to others, to one degree or another. Finding ways to exercise your altruism can keep you happy and less stressed. Love: This is a bit of a no-brainer, but having love in your life is great for keeping yourself feeling joy. Friends: Maintaining a supportive circle, even if that circle is small, can help you to feel happier in virtually every area of life and can provide an excellent buffer against stress. Children: Kids bring meaning into our lives, as well as many smiles and belly laughs. Relatives: Unless you come from a heavily drama-prone family, staying close to relatives can keep your life fun, supportive, and meaningful. Finding low-stress ways to communicate with your family is important for keeping things drama-free, however. Home: Maintaining a home that acts as a haven from stress is important at the end of the day. Neighborhood: Living in a neighborhood that's close and supportive, or at least one that doesn't involve feuds or danger, can contribute to happiness and decrease stress by offering support and connection. Community: Being part of a community, whether it's a physical community like the area where you live or a community of friends based on shared spiritual views, life goals, or things in common.​",happiness absence stress relationships stress relieve activities happiness positive psychology pioneer martin seligman research write extensively authentic happiness facilitate enhance things may instinctively know good soul strong relationships challenge work mean life michael frisch baylor university professor another pioneer field positive psychology find different areas life contribute person happiness measure satisfaction areas help measure person overall level happiness life satisfaction many things bring happiness also things relieve stress exercise express creativity maintain supportive friendships keep organize home enjoy work overwhelm stress often relieve imminent pressure foremost mind however follow stress relief program also incorporate activities know increase overall happiness give short term stress relief last gain happy life incorporate life general state happiness make habit lifestyle feature promote better able weather future stress life follow list different feature promote happiness resources site others help incorporate feature life relieve stress time health maintain health maintain happiness health issue bring additional stress make difficult things bring happiness stress relief self esteem feel good touchy feely thing worry kid important like person right low self esteem seem affect many areas life goals value spiritual life three different things make important category involve internal positive focus something greater right things bring mean life closely tie happiness money true beyond certain point money bring significantly happiness also true however little money bring stress challenge happiness enough money live comfortably important work job fulfill ideal job make miserable must play leisure time fun let loose important happiness stress level need play time really need time fun life learn take new skills grow person involve gratifications provide greater resources life great stress happiness creativity true express creativity fact art activities exercise creativity show good health happiness consider non creative type well help turn humans really love helpful others one degree another find ways exercise altruism keep happy less stress love bite brainer love life great keep feel joy friends maintain supportive circle even circle small help feel happier virtually every area life provide excellent buffer stress children kid bring mean live well many smile belly laugh relatives unless come heavily drama prone family stay close relatives keep life fun supportive meaningful find low stress ways communicate family important keep things drama free however home maintain home act stress important end day neighborhood live neighborhood close supportive least one involve feud danger contribute happiness decrease stress offer support connection community part community whether physical community like area live community friends base share spiritual view life goals things common

The human pursuit of happiness is one of the most common human searches, but it tends to be an elusive goal as well. Luckily for us, the experience of ""happiness"" can actually take many forms and result from a variety of behaviors and life circumstances. Research can now point us to concrete ways that we can find or develop these various forms of happiness in our lives.﻿﻿
 
The feeling of joy comes from losing yourself in the present moment and appreciating what you have. It's fleeting in that it can sneak up on you and sometimes can disappear if you try to analyze it too much. It can also be found in many things if you have the right attitude and perspective, so it's a relatively accessible form of happiness to seek.
 
The easiest way to find joy is to engage in activities you know usually bring you joy. This can be anything from yoga to amusement parks to your favorite music. It's also important to try some new things to find novel avenues of joy.
 
Though it can last longer than joy, this emotion is still somewhat fleeting—it dissipates rather quickly and can turn into ennui. However, it can be a motivating factor. Excitement about a new job, for example, can motivate you to work harder, and excitement about a new relationship can motivate you to put more effort into working through difficulties.
 
Excitement can also help you to get through jitters.
 If you tell yourself you are excited rather than anxious or nervous, studies have found, you can channel that potentially uncomfortable energy into more constructive activity. 
Excitement can also extend the positive feelings you get from an activity. If you focus on your excited feelings of anticipation, the fun of a vacation can extend into the days and weeks before you even leave. Excitement isn't too difficult to come by, either, so this is an easy one to pursue. Take on new challenges. Keep a bucket list. Let yourself revel in anticipation when you have something big coming up.
 
Gratitude can disappear if you don't actively focus on it, but it's also an important form of happiness. Those who feel gratitude on a regular basis tend to be happier and healthier than those who are less prone to these feelings, according to research.﻿﻿
 
Further, gratitude is very simple to cultivate. You can use a gratitude journal, loving-kindness meditation, or even simply tell people in your life that you appreciate them, and do it often. Cultivating these feelings of gratitude has been shown to ward off feelings of depression, among other things. It may be less obvious, but this type of happiness can be brought to mind again and again.
 
While smug or competitive pride can be a negative thing, feelings of pride in your accomplishments can be a form of gratitude turned inward and are a great form of happiness to indulge in. You can take pride in your work and your family, your home and your self, and in anything you put effort, care, and love into.
 
You can cultivate a healthy sense of pride by including personal accomplishments in your gratitude journal or keeping a list of ""wins"" at the end of each day. This isn't the same as bragging or being ""full of yourself""—you're not saying that you're better than others because of your accomplishments, but that you're a better form of yourself, and you're appreciating this fact.
 
Studies also connect optimism with greater outcomes in life.﻿﻿ Optimists tend to focus on possibilities and have a combination of gratitude and pride. They're grateful for all of the possibilities life presents, proud of their abilities to harness these resources, and have a strong belief in themselves and their ability to make their attempts at whatever goals they pursue success.
 
Optimists, when faced with disappointment, tend to minimize it, pinpoint how they can do better next time, and see mitigating factors that led to their negative outcomes. When they succeed, they give themselves credit and take it as a sign of better things to come. Optimism tends to be an overall way of being, so it's less fleeting than other forms of happiness.
 
Contentment means being happy with what you have. Those who are content are less disappointed by life's drawbacks and feel lucky to have what they have in their lives already.
 
People strive to feel this form of happiness, and it can come with a focus of gratitude on what you have as well as a feeling that you have climbed high and deserve to enjoy the rewards that come with the effort. Reveling in your accomplishments and in everything you have can bring contentment, so focusing on what you have is a great way to stay content.
 
Love and happiness are sometimes said to be interchangeable, that love is an infinite source of happiness, and happiness itself is a form of love. However you look at it, both are vital to have in your life.
 
True love is fabled to be extremely difficult to come by, but in actuality, love can be found all around you. Family, friends, romantic partners, and even pets can all be sources of love, and focusing on all of these relationships can greatly enrich your life. This is a form of happiness that can come in endless supply.
 
Even though stressful relationships can sap us of happiness, healthy and supportive relationships can bring great and lasting happiness. Focusing on relationship skills, spending time with loved ones, and in other ways cultivating these relationships can help you to keep this form of happiness in your life.

Narrative therapy is a style of therapy that helps people become—and embrace being—an expert in their own lives. In narrative therapy, there is an emphasis on the stories we develop and carry with us through our lives. As we experience events and interactions, we give meaning to those experiences and they, in turn, influence how we see ourselves and our world. We can carry multiple stories at once, such as those related to our self-esteem, our abilities, our relationships, and our work, for example.
 
This approach of therapy was developed by Michael White and David Epston, two New Zealand-based therapists, who believed it was important to see people as separate from their problems. Developed in the 1980s, narrative therapy seeks to have an empowering effect and offer counseling that is non-blaming and non-pathological in nature.﻿﻿
 
White and Epston felt it was critically important for people to not label themselves or to see themselves as ""broken"" or ""the problem,"" or for them to feel powerless in their circumstances and behavior patterns.
 
Narrative therapy was developed with three main components in mind. The following create the foundation for the relationship between a narrative therapist and their client:
 
The focus of narrative therapy is around stories that we develop within ourselves and carry through our lives. We give meaning to our personal experiences and these meanings that we come up with, or that have been placed on us by others, influence how we see ourselves and the world around us. Narrative therapy is concerned with our stories, which are believed to influence our thoughts and, in turn, our decision-making and behaviors.﻿﻿
 
Narrative therapy is based on the following principles:
 
Narrative therapy suggests that we create stories throughout our lives as a way to make sense of our experiences and we can carry many stories with us at one time. Although some stories can be positive and others negative, all stories impact our lives in the past, the present, and in the future.
 
As described in narrative therapy, stories involve the following four elements working together:
 
There can be many factors that contribute to our development of stories. These factors influence how we interpret events or interactions, as well as the meanings we attach to them. Some of the factors include:
 
As we think about these factors, we likely hold beliefs about them and what they mean to us or how they impact us in the world. Our beliefs around these things shape how we might see ourselves and what we tell ourselves about an experience or interaction.
 
We carry multiple stories with us at once, such as stories about our relationships, our professional lives, our weaknesses, our strengths, our goals and more. Narrative therapy emphasizes the exploration of these stories, as they can have a significant influence on our decision-making and behavior.
 
Although we can carry several stories at the same time, there is typically a story that is more dominant than the others. When our dominant story gets in the way of us living our best life or seems to sabotage our efforts at growth and change, it becomes problematic. Many times, when people come into counseling they are faced with a problematic dominant story that is causing them emotional pain.
 
A narrative therapist works with clients to explore the stories that they carry about themselves, their lives and their relationships. When a dominant story is problematic, it will surface in our interactions with others, in our decision-making and in our behavior patterns.
 
A problematic dominant story that we carry may have started with a judgment that was placed on us by others, particularly those who might have been in a position of authority or influence over us, like a parent or caregiver.
 
For example if, when we were young, we behaved in a way that resulted in a parent calling us ""lazy,"" we may begin thinking of ourselves as lazy and weaving that label into our story as we move into other experiences. The trait of being lazy then continues to grow and become part of a dominant story for us, influencing how we see ourselves and how we behave or interact with others in the future.
 
These specific judgments are referred to as thin descriptions in narrative therapy and may continue to be carried through our lives, becoming what is called a thin conclusion.﻿﻿ In essence, using the term ""thin"" to describe these specific descriptions and conclusions means that there is little consideration for outside circumstances that might influence our decision-making and behavior. Once something like this takes hold, it can be easy to imagine how it can grow over time and become a problem for us.
 
If we have been judged a certain way by our family growing up, referring back to the example of being lazy, it can be very difficult for us to shake that off or get that label out of our story. Not only do we end up often carrying this with us over time, but events that leave us to feel or be seen as lazy continue to support the dominant story that we are a lazy person.
 
This story becomes problematic, getting in the way of us being able to make healthy decisions that more accurately represent who we are and what we value.﻿﻿ We find it more and more difficult to separate ourselves from our problems. In fact, we come to think that we are the problem.
 
Unfortunately, thin descriptions tend to be focused on our weaknesses or areas that we might believe we don't measure up. When we try to make decisions that challenge our dominant story, it may be overlooked by others, and even ourselves, because it is seen as the exception rather than the rule. Our ""not lazy"" behaviors might be minimized or overlooked because it doesn't match up with our dominant story.
 
In other words, we might even not give ourselves credit for making good decisions or behaving in a positive way because it doesn't match up with the story we tell ourselves about who we are and what we're capable of.
 
Narrative therapy focuses on these stories, particularly the dominant stories that are problematic and seem to get in the way of us living our best lives. A trained narrative therapist works with people to explore these stories and to seek out information that helps us to challenge these problematic stories.
 Through narrative therapy, we can begin to identify alternative stories that offer us an opportunity to challenge judgment and explore what other information we are carrying within us. Exploring in this way helps us to widen our view of self, challenge old and unhealthy beliefs and to open our minds to new ways of living that reflect a more accurate and healthy story. 
Within narrative therapy, there is a strong emphasis on separating the person from their problem. By doing this, the person begins to understand that they are capable of something new. Old, unhelpful meanings that have been woven into our stories over time can be challenged.
 
As people widen their view of self and explore additional information, there can be room made for healthy changes in our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When there is space created between us and our problem, we can better examine and choose what is serving us well and what is not. Narrative therapy does not aim to change a person but to allow them to become an expert in their own life.
 
There are a variety of techniques and exercises used in narrative therapy to help people heal and move past a problematic story. Some of the most commonly used techniques include:
 
One of the primary things that a narrative therapist would help their client do is to begin putting together their narrative. In doing this, we are able to find our voice and explore events in our lives and the meanings we have placed on these experiences—and, therefore, on ourselves—over time.
 
Some people may not be aware of a particular story that has followed them through their life, but know that something keeps them from living a good life or making good decisions for themselves. As their story is put together, the person becomes an observer to their story and looks at it with the therapist, working to identify the dominant and problematic story.
 
While we are using our voice to put together our story, we are becoming observers of ourselves. We use this exercise to create distance between us and our problems, which is called externalization.
 
When we have this distance between ourselves and our problem, we can better focus on changing unwanted behaviors rather than feeling we, ourselves, are the problem. As we practice externalization, we get a chance to see that we are capable of change and begin feeling empowered to work toward healing.
 
Deconstruction is used to help people gain clarity in their story. There are times when our dominant story can feel big and overwhelming as if we can never get out from under it.
 
When a problematic story in our life feels like it has been around for a long time, we might use generalized statements and become confused in our own stories. A narrative therapist would work with us to break down our story into smaller parts, to help us clarify our problem and help it become more approachable.﻿﻿
 
When our story feels concrete, as if it could never change, any idea of alternative stories goes out the window. We can become very stuck in our story and allow it to influence several areas of our lives, impacting our decision making, our behaviors, our experiences, and our relationships.
 
A narrative therapist works to help us to not only challenge our problems but to widen our view by considering alternative stories. They might help us to explore information we have been carrying with us for a long time but have never allowed to have any value. This information can help us develop a new, healthy story of who we are, what we want, and who we want to become.
 
Narrative therapy is a unique, specialized approach to counseling. There are training opportunities for therapists to learn more about narrative therapy and how to use this approach with clients.
 
Trained narrative therapists are located throughout the world and can be found through online resources such as The Dulwich Centre, developed by White and Epston, the founders of narrative therapy.
 
To find a therapist trained in narrative therapy close to home, you can also search sites such as Psychology Today, which allows you to search therapists in your area, even narrowing your search by the style of counseling they use. This would allow you to specifically find trained narrative therapists in your area.
 
Take time to research options and, if you have questions for a therapist about narrative therapy and how they use this with clients, do not be afraid to ask. Many therapists welcome the opportunity to share with people their specialized style of counseling and how it can help.
 
Understanding that we use stories to organize and make sense of our world and our experiences, it is important to remember how powerful our words can be and how much they can influence our decision-making and behavior.
 
Narrative therapy allows people to not only find their voice but to use their voice for good, helping them to become experts in their own lives and to live in a way that reflects their goals and values.
 
We have more power for growth and change than we think, especially when we own our voice and our story. As David Epston, one of the developers of narrative therapy, has stated, ""The problem is the problem. The person is not the problem.""
 Respect: People participating in narrative therapy are treated with respect and supported for the bravery it takes to come forward and work through personal challenges. Non-Blaming: There is no blame placed on the client as they work through their stories and they are also encouraged to not place blame on others. Focus is instead placed on recognizing and changing unwanted and unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. Client as Expert: Narrative therapists are not viewed as an advice-giving authority but, rather, a collaborative partner in helping clients grow and heal. Clients know themselves well and exploring this information will allow for a change in their thoughts and behaviors. Reality is socially constructed. The way we interact with others impacts how we experience reality. These experiences with others become our known reality. Reality is influenced by (and communicated through) language. People interpret experiences through language and people can have different interpretations of the same event or interaction. Having a narrative can help us maintain and organize our reality. The development of a narrative or story can help us to make sense of our experiences. There is no ""objective reality."" People can have different realities of the same experience. What might be true for us may not be true for someone else.

When you first make a new friend, you probably aren't thinking about the future and the possibility that the friendship will end. However, it is inevitable that eventually some of your friends will no longer be in your life. People grow apart for various reasons and not every friendship is lifelong.
 
At the same time, most people aren't sure of the ""rules"" of ending friendships. Unlike with romantic relationships, in which there are clear precedents about how to ""break up"" with someone and clear labels to refer to whether you are ""in"" or ""out"" of a relationship, the same is not true for friendships.
 
This can leave you in a strange sort of limbo where you no longer want to be friends with someone but don't know how to get to that new place.
 
Before you decide on a course of action for ending a friendship, it's helpful to outline for yourself the reasons why you no longer want to be friends with a particular person. This helps you to move forward as you end the friendship.
 
One way to do this is by journaling your feelings. This allows you a safe space to get out your thoughts without discussing them with other people. Of most importance, don't discuss your feelings with the friend you want to break up with until they are clear in your own mind—if you choose to do so at all.
 
Below are some common reasons why you might choose to end a friendship:﻿﻿
 
Again, because there is so little information on how to ""break up"" with a friend, and it is rarely talked about, most people don't know how to end a friendship, and they may not even know when they are justified in wanting to do so.
 Know that a friend should never ask you to compromise your integrity, go against your values or commitments, tell a lie, or hurt someone by doing something. Although it may feel like a significant loss to lose a friend, someone who no longer is making your life better does not deserve that space in your life. 
Before we talk about the best ways to end a friendship, it's helpful to consider some of the worst ways. While some of these tactics might be appropriate in certain situations, in general, they are not helpful strategies and should be avoided.
 
In general, we can consider four healthy options when ending a friendship, and in some cases, you may find that you need to use a combination of these strategies.
 
This tactic involves letting the friendship come to a natural close by gradually reducing social interaction with the other person.﻿﻿ This is akin to taking the stitches out of a garment versus tearing it apart.
 
Gradually fading out of the friendship might be a good option if you are afraid of confrontation, if the person is likely not to listen or accept what you are saying, or for toxic situations.
 
In general, fading out of a friendship avoids hurt feelings. Instead of laying your feelings on the line, you just become too busy to get together or generally hard to reach. You might text instead of call, fade out of the person's social media, take a long time when getting back in touch, answer with short replies, etc.
 
Perhaps in the past, you were a good listener, but now you don't have the patience or don't bother keeping the peace if you disagree on a point. Whether or not you go all out and ""unfriend"" that person on social media is up to you. It might be better not to take that step, as it only draws attention to the fact that you are trying to exit the friendship.
 
In general, you are doing things that might naturally happen in a friendship that is fading out—it's just that you are choosing to do them intentionally to exit the friendship. The fade-out is a good option if the friend is just an acquaintance since in that situation it might seem awkward or weird to go over reasons as to why you don't want to be friends anymore. 
 
While fading out of friendship may seem kinder, it could drag on if the friend does not take the hint. In that case, you might be putting that person through a stressful situation, as they try to guess what is going on or why you've suddenly disappeared.
 
Finally, the fade-out might be your best option if the friendship is toxic and you don't want to have to explain yourself, if you've been harmed by the person, or if you just don't care enough anymore to give them an explanation.
 
If you determine that a gradual fade-out is not appropriate or if it just ends up not working, then you will need to engage in ""the talk.""﻿﻿ This is similar to a talk you would have in a romantic relationship to determine where each of you stands and to talk about the future.
 
""The talk"" can be a stepping stone to the end of a friendship, but you might also be surprised to find that you are able to resolve your differences and fix the friendship.
 
Step 1: Ask the person to meet you for coffee or some other beverage to chat. Be sure to ask to meet in person—never do this over the phone, by text, or by email.
 
Step 2: Have a goal for ""the talk."" Think about what you want to achieve. Do you want to clear up a miscommunication, explain resentment, address an old argument, or set boundaries? Whatever it is that you hope to achieve, it needs to be clear in your head before you meet.
 
Start out with a statement that opens the doors for more conversation. For example: ""I've noticed some patterns in our friendship in the past few months that have been bothering me. I wondered if we could talk about it.""
 
Step 3: Talk about how you are feeling, not what the other person has done wrong. Keep your goals for the conversation in mind. Remember to listen as much as you talk.
 
You may determine from ""the talk"" that your differences can't be resolved. If that's the case, what do you do? You could immediately terminate the friendship, or you could decide to ""take a break,"" much the same way people sometimes do in romantic relationships. 
 
Taking a break can have many positives. It gives you:
 
You can give any number of reasons for taking a break. You could say that you are going to be extra busy for a couple of weeks, if you prefer to be vague. On the other hand, if you've just had ""the talk,"" you could say that you need time to digest everything.
 
Set a time in the future that you plan to reconvene, or suggest that you will get in touch when you feel you are ready.
 
Sometimes it is impossible to avoid the chaos that goes along with a sudden ending to a friendship. This is true if you are dealing with a toxic friend or someone who does not respect boundaries that you try to set.
 
In this situation, simply state that your needs are not being met in the friendship.﻿﻿ Wish the other person all the best in the future. This type of friendship break-up can be good in that it is unambiguous and clear, and you get a chance to voice any issues that you've been holding back on. At the same time, it can be awkward to confront someone in this manner.
 
This type of friendship breakup will be most appropriate if you've known someone a long time and feel they deserve the respect of a final goodbye, or if someone does something so awful that it would be hard to ignore. At some point, you could simply say, ""Goodbye, I need to go."" If it helps, write a little script that expresses what you are feeling. 
 
What might a friend do if you break up with them?
 
They may react in the following ways:
 
It's best to be prepared for each of these possibilities, but realize that you might not know how you will feel until you get into the situation. You might be surprised to learn that a friendship can be saved or converted into something else.
 
Breaking up a friendship can be just as stressful and emotionally draining as ending a romantic relationship. Be sure to be good to yourself afterward. It's normal to feel sad, frustrated, or angry.
 
Keep on top of your mental health to ensure that the end of the friendship does not cause problems for you in terms of poor physical health or lowered resistance to stress. Just like a divorce, the breakup of a friendship will get easier with time.
 Circumstances: Your lives have changed (no longer working together, going to the same school, etc.). Distance: You've grown apart in terms of interests or commitments. Lying: Your friend is deceitful. Negativity: Your friend spends more time cutting you down than building you up. Obligation: The person has become an obligatory friend who you no longer enjoy.

Empathy is a powerful force that helps maintain social order and cooperation. It is the mechanism that allows people to understand and relate to others. Empathy is a necessary precursor to intimacy, trust, and belonging. It is also the feeling that makes it difficult to turn a blind eye to the suffering of others.
 
Empathic people experience a number of happiness benefits. Empathy often encourages altruistic behavior, and empathy-based kindness has been shown to increase cooperation and forgiveness, strengthen relationships, decrease aggression and judgment, and even improve mental and physical health.﻿﻿
 
Interestingly, research does show that happier people tend to be less aware of negative emotions in others despite rating themselves as being more empathic.﻿﻿ However, it is important to practice empathy, regardless of the mood in order to create greater happiness for ourselves and others.
 
Practicing the key components of empathy can help you better understand and interact with people in your life.
 
Before you can connect with what someone else is feeling, you have to recognize what that feeling is. Listening is crucial—but not always easy.
 
When a good friend calls you and needs to vent about how stressful work has been or how tough things have been since their recent breakup, the emotion in their voice usually gets your attention pretty quickly. It gets harder when conversations are happening amidst distractions and with less obvious emotional weight.
 Empathy begins when you set the intention of listening for emotion. Make an effort to notice the signals people are giving that can indicate what they are feeling. 
Your own emotions can pose a significant barrier when it comes to noticing what others are feeling. When you are having a conversation and are looking only at your own feelings and how you can communicate them, you might not be leaving enough attention available to take in what’s going on at the other end. Making an effort to actively listen can help strengthen your emotional understanding and empathy.
 
Once you recognize emotion in another person, empathy puts you squarely in that person’s shoes. Empathy is not feeling what you would feel in that situation; it is stepping beside yourself and adopting their emotions for a few moments.
 
Some research suggests that we succeed at this task by virtue of mirror neurons, or brain pathways that fire whether we’re experiencing the stimulus or we see someone else experience it.﻿﻿
 
Mirror neurons are responsible for getting your heart racing when you admire athletes running through a stadium at your favorite sporting event or making you recoil in pain when watching unfortunate blunders in a funny viral video.
 
When people become immersed in someone else’s grief, sadness, or irritation, this empathy can not only stand next to them and console them with greater understanding, but it also sends a message that they are willing to take on a painful emotion so that others don’t have to go it alone.
 
Empathic connections are a two-way street. Allowing yourself to fully take in another person’s emotion can enhance your relationships, and allowing yourself to be vulnerable to others can amplify such connections.
 When you share experiences of your own challenging emotions, like guilt, anxiety, and shame, you create opportunities for others to empathize with you. 
Being vulnerable strengthens your own empathy in two ways. First, feeling the value of empathy when it’s reflected back to you can deepen your commitment to being empathic for others. You also gain more comfort navigating tough emotions in conversations with others.
 
It’s not easy to hold onto a conversation about painful emotions, but if you deliberately train this ability in yourself by taking advantage of the opportunities when you have an emotion to share, you’ll be better equipped for the receiving end.
 
If empathy rests at sharing in negative emotion, happiness can suffer. When people feel deep sadness for victims of a natural disaster, they get closer to putting themselves in other people's shoes.
 
But just feeling someone else’s pain, while it may enhance a sense of belonging and being understood if communicated, doesn’t maximize the opportunity to enhance well-being. The advantage of knowing what another person is going through is that you can better identify what other people need.
 
Because empathy means that you are adopting the emotion but not the tough situation that gave rise to it, you are usually in a more empowered place to help.
 For empathy to be most effective and maximize well-being, it is important to feel both the pain of another and also know that you are in a position to do something about it. 
In a classic study where participants watched another person receive electric shocks and were given a choice to help the person by taking the remaining shocks themselves, people high in empathy were more likely to step in and help even when they could simply turn away and not watch anymore.﻿﻿ Effective empathy allowed participants to feel the pain of the shock enough that they wanted to help, but not so much that they were reluctant to take it on themselves.
 
Improve your empathy by practicing the following on a regular basis. Over time, you will find that your ability to understand and relate to the emotions of others becomes stronger.
 
Empathy not only allows you to understand others—it can also give you the motivation you need to make a difference. Whether that means consoling a friend, buying a small gift for someone who needs it, or donating to causes helping natural disaster victims, empathy becomes effective when you use it as motivation to do something about the problem.
 
When you see someone else going through a hard time, be sure to listen and share, but also clearly identify what you can do to help. The follow-through on empathy means initiating positive change for others. The beautiful thing about empathy is that when others begin to flourish, it improves your own life as well.
 Talk to other people. Make it a point to begin conversations with people you meet and see across your day-to-day interactions. While engaging in the conversation, pay particular attention to what that person is feeling. Notice body language cues. This can including tone of voice and subtle shifts in energy. Focus on listening. Manage both the distractions and your own feelings that could easily grab your attention and work on staying emotionally attuned throughout the conversation.  Take action. Recognize that you can do things, however small, to make a difference in someone else's life.",empathy powerful force help maintain social order cooperation mechanism allow people understand relate others empathy necessary precursor intimacy trust belong also feel make difficult turn blind eye suffer others empathic people experience number happiness benefit empathy often encourage altruistic behavior empathy base kindness show increase cooperation forgiveness strengthen relationships decrease aggression judgment even improve mental physical health interestingly research show happier people tend less aware negative emotions others despite rat empathic however important practice empathy regardless mood order create greater happiness others practice key components empathy help better understand interact people life connect someone else feel recognize feel listen crucial always easy good friend call need vent stressful work tough things since recent breakup emotion voice usually get attention pretty quickly get harder conversations happen amidst distractions less obvious emotional weight empathy begin set intention listen emotion make effort notice signal people give indicate feel emotions pose significant barrier come notice others feel conversation look feel communicate might leave enough attention available take end make effort actively listen help strengthen emotional understand empathy recognize emotion another person empathy put squarely person shoe empathy feel would feel situation step beside adopt emotions moments research suggest succeed task virtue mirror neurons brain pathways fire whether experience stimulus see someone else experience mirror neurons responsible get heart race admire athletes run stadium favorite sport event make recoil pain watch unfortunate blunder funny viral video people become immerse someone else grief sadness irritation empathy stand next console greater understand also send message will take painful emotion others alone empathic connections two way street allow fully take another person emotion enhance relationships allow vulnerable others amplify connections share experience challenge emotions like guilt anxiety shame create opportunities others empathize vulnerable strengthen empathy two ways first feel value empathy reflect back deepen commitment empathic others also gain comfort navigate tough emotions conversations others easy hold onto conversation painful emotions deliberately train ability take advantage opportunities emotion share better equip receive end empathy rest share negative emotion happiness suffer people feel deep sadness victims natural disaster get closer put people shoe feel someone else pain may enhance sense belong understand communicate maximize opportunity enhance well advantage know another person better identify people need empathy mean adopt emotion tough situation give rise usually empower place help empathy effective maximize well important feel pain another also know position something classic study participants watch another person receive electric shock give choice help person take remain shock people high empathy likely step help even could simply turn away watch anymore effective empathy allow participants feel pain shock enough want help much reluctant take improve empathy practice follow regular basis time find ability understand relate emotions others become stronger empathy allow understand others also give motivation need make difference whether mean console friend buy small gift someone need donate cause help natural disaster victims empathy become effective use motivation something problem see someone else hard time sure listen share also clearly identify help follow empathy mean initiate positive change others beautiful thing empathy others begin flourish improve life well talk people make point begin conversations people meet see across day day interactions engage conversation pay particular attention person feel notice body language cue include tone voice subtle shift energy focus listen manage distractions feel could easily grab attention work stay emotionally attune throughout conversation take action recognize things however small make difference someone else life

Flow is often described as a mental state in which people experience complete immersion and involvement in an activity. Things seem to happen almost effortlessly and time seems to disappear while in this state. Athletes often refer to this state of mind as being ""in the zone.""
 
""Everything vanishes around me, and works are born as if out of the void,"" said the artist Paul Klee. ""Ripe, graphic fruits fall off. My hand has become the obedient instrument of a remote will.""
 
What Klee described in this quote is a perfect example of what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow. Total immersion in a task, a feeling of complete concentration and losing track of the outside world are all common characteristics of this state of mind.
 
Obviously reaching this state of flow is something many of us would like to accomplish on a regular basis. Fortunately, flow is not something restricted to just elite athletes, artists, and performers. You can achieve this state during a number of activities such as while working, while engaging in exercise, or while engaging in a hobby. So what exactly does it take to achieve a state of flow?
 
According to Csikszentmihalyi, flow is most likely to occur when your skill level is perfectly aligned to the challenge that the activity presents.﻿﻿ So a runner might experience flow during a marathon that he or she is well-prepared for, or a chess-player might reach this state during a game that presents the perfect challenge. In other words, gaining practice, experience, and expertise in an activity will make it more likely that you will achieve flow in the future.
 
A slight stretching of your skills, or attempting something that is a little more advanced than your current abilities, can also foster a flow state.﻿﻿ For a dancer, this might involve attempting a move that presents a bit of a challenge. For a graphic designer, it might involve taking on a project that requires utilizing a new type of software.
 Focus on adding new challenges on a regular basis. Not only will you become more skilled, you may find that the state of flow becomes much easier to achieve. 
You need to have a specific purpose for focusing on the task, such as winning an athletic contest, playing a particular piece of music or finishing a work project.﻿﻿ That is not to say you should only engage in an activity in order to achieve a goal. People who achieve flow frequently are often intrinsically motivated to perform certain actions. In other words, they may have specific goals in mind, but they engage in these actions for their own sake as well.
 
It is important to devote all of your concentration to the task at hand.﻿﻿ Multitasking and other distractions will disrupt the flow state. Set aside a time and space that will allow you to work on a project without being interrupted or distracted. Turn off your phone, television or other devices that might pull you away from the task at hand.
 
While having a goal is important, flow requires enjoying the journey and not just fixating on the end product. Allow yourself to simply live in the present moment without worrying too much about the ultimate outcome of your efforts.
 
Achieving flow can be a pleasurable experience, but it may also have other benefits as well. Research suggests that the benefits of flow include increased skill development and improved performance.﻿﻿ Becoming more skilled and capable at a task can help improve your self-esteem in that area and give you a boost of self-confidence related to those skills.

Have you ever noticed that some people seem to be able to maintain a relatively positive attitude regardless of what’s happening around them? Like everyone, they can appreciate the good times, but they also seem to be able to focus on the positive in the face of some pretty negative events. They see the good in difficult people, they see the opportunity in a challenging situation, and they appreciate what they have, even in the face of loss. Would you like to increase your ability to maintain a positive attitude in your life, even in the face of significant stress?
 
Fortunately, a positive attitude can be cultivated, with a little practice. Although we are born with specific temperamental tendencies, the brain is a muscle, and you can strengthen your mind’s natural tendency toward optimism if you work at it. And also, fortunately, working on building your ""gratitude muscle"" can be enjoyable in itself. But the benefits you gain would make it worth the effort even if it was a dull, difficult task.
 While several factors go into emotional resilience and optimism, studies show that cultivating a sense of gratitude can help you maintain a more positive mood in daily life and contribute to the greater emotional well-being and bring social benefits as well. 
Cultivating gratitude is one of the simpler routes to a greater sense of emotional well-being, higher overall life satisfaction, and a greater sense of happiness in life. People with a greater level of gratitude tend to have stronger relationships in that they appreciate their loved ones more, and their loved ones, feeling that appreciation, tend to do more to earn it. And because those who are happier, sleep better, and enjoy healthy relationships tend to be healthier, grateful people tend to be healthier people.
 
Fortunately, gratitude can be cultivated, and this can be accomplished in several ways. For the next few weeks, try some of the following exercises, and you should notice a significant increase in your feelings of gratitude — you will likely find yourself noticing more positive things in your life, dwelling less on negative or stressful events and feelings of ‘lack,’ and having a greater sense of appreciation for the people and things in your life.
 
When you notice yourself grumbling about a negative event or stressor in your life, try to think of 4 or 5 related things for which you are grateful. For example, when feeling stressed at work, try to think about several things that you like about your job. You can do the same with relationship stress, financial stress, or other daily hassles.
 The more you gently remind yourself of the positives, the more easily a shift toward gratitude can occur. 
Many people cause themselves unnecessary stress by making comparisons. More specifically, they cause themselves stress by making the wrong comparisons. They compare themselves only to those who have more, do more, or are in some way closer to their ideals, and allow themselves to feel inferior instead of inspired. In cultivating gratitude, you have one of two options if you find yourself making such comparisons: You can either choose to compare yourself to people who have less than you (which reminds you how truly rich and lucky you are), or you can feel gratitude for having people in your life who can inspire you. Either road can lead away from stress and envy, and closer to feelings of gratitude. Here are some more strategies for minimizing the stress of social comparison on social media.
 
One of the best ways to cultivate gratitude is to keep a gratitude journal. Not only are you combining the benefits of journaling with the active adoption of a more positive mindset, but you are also left with a nice catalog of happy memories and a long list of things in your life for which you are grateful.

Because habits are usually formed within two or three weeks, you will have to actively focus on maintaining gratitude less and less as you go, and the habit of a more positive (and less stress-inducing) attitude will be more automatic. And greater feelings of emotional well-being can be yours.

There are many paths to personal growth. Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying, ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger,"" and this can absolutely be true. But challenges that nearly destroy us aren't the only path to greater personal development.
 
Setting goals for your own personal development can be an effective (and less stressful) way to grow emotionally and intellectually. Goal-setting can help you to succeed as a person in the ways that are important to you and can help you to streamline your life, minimize stress, and really become the person you were meant to be in far less time. It can also help you to stay mentally sharp as any lifetime learner can tell you.
 
Personal growth means different things to different people, but the following goals can be widely helpful in creating a life filled with healthy habits, greater happiness, and meaning in life. 
 
We all have values that are a vital part of who we are. To some people, artistic expression is an indispensable part of who they are, and they fare much better if they are creating, at least some of the time, in their lives. To some, helping others is something they must do, and the meaning it brings to them and others is what makes life valuable. Others need to be solving problems to feel alive. 
 
The reason it matters to realize this is that many people fill their time with things that are important but aren't aligned with their values, with what they value most in life. If you analyze what is important to you, you can set goals to ensure that you make this a greater part of your life.
 
Many people self-sabotage in one way or another without realizing it. Perhaps you don't believe that you're capable of achieving things that you really want to achieve, and you limit yourself by not trying. Perhaps you're not allowing yourself to devote enough time to your goals because you're getting bogged down by other things in your schedule that are less important but that you feel ""must"" be done.
 
One way to identify this subtle self-sabotage is to focus on living each day as though it were pivotal to your success in life. Is everything you're doing important, and contributing to your success? If you view things through this lens, it's easier to identify energy drains and time wasters, as well as those things that hold you back.
 
When your health is compromised, it's more challenging to focus on your goals in life. This is obviously true when facing serious health conditions, but it's also true of less serious types of health compromises. 
 
For example, most of us feel far more stressed and are not at our best when we haven't had adequate sleep for a few nights in a row or have eaten unhealthy food for a few days. Focusing on taking care of your health can make a huge impact on the rest of your life.
 
Time management is an important goal in itself. When you manage your time wisely, you have more energy and a far greater ability to pursue other things in life that are important to you. Time management enables you to maximize time spent in activities that feed you, motivate you, and help you develop yourself as a person.
 
You may not be able to transform yourself in a few weeks, but focusing heavily on creating new habits on a regular basis can be transformative over the course of several months or years. The trick is to get into the habit of forming habits. Focus the bulk of your energy on making something new a standard part of your life, and then move on once you've become comfortable with it. This is the time to create a new habit.
 
Have just one friend who is farther along on the path you hope to travel. Life coaches refer to these people as ""expert friends"" and they can be life-changing as they'll have tips and inspiration you can pick up just by watching them be themselves. With these friends, watching becomes doing. This is also supported by social learning theory, which explains how it makes things easier when you have a friend to help you along the way.
 
Using the momentum of a group can really help you to reach your goals. This is because peer pressure can be a strong influencer, so using it to your advantage is wise. Having people who can cheer you on when you win and help you to feel better when you lose can make all the difference with your success.
 
Unfortunately, not all friends are able to support you in this way. Some people naturally feel envious when their friends succeed too much. So if you notice a friend being less than supportive when you reach a goal (and you have been supportive of them), you may want to simply avoid sharing your successes with this friend and move on to friends who are genuinely thrilled with your success and able to support you when you aren't as successful as you'd like to be.
 
Remember to be this kind of friend as well. Another idea is to find a group already focused on the goals you're trying to attain. You'll have built-in support, enthusiasm, and practical tips.
 
Self-development takes real focus. Learning a new language, for example, or developing a new skill can take time, and focusing the bulk of your energy toward immersing yourself in the pursuit of a goal is a great way to reach it. This is ideal when you want to really go deep in your knowledge and ability. 
 
You don't have to pursue your hobbies as a career in order to fully explore them. It's wonderful if you can make money doing what you love, but it doesn't have to be a profession to be worth your time. Activities like this allow you to experience a sense of flow, which can increase your happiness level and decrease stress as well. This means that you'll experience benefits far beyond the mere acquisition of a new pastime.
 
Identifying goals to go after is an important first step. However, it's also important to know how to pursue your goals. There are a few tricks to maintaining goals or adopting healthy habits.
 
Maintaining goals can be a little more involved than that, but this is the basic process. The vast majority of people who try to set personal growth goals tend to abandon them because they set their goals too high (or the wrong goals for their lifestyle), try to make too big of a change in too short of a time, don’t congratulate themselves for making progress on their goals, and give up if they have a slip. True success comes from breaking your goals down into smaller steps, rewarding your progress and, perhaps most importantly, trying again if you find yourself slipping up.
 
Setting personal goals that can really improve your life and then sticking with them can help you to live the life you always hoped to have.

Remember how easy it was to make friends in elementary school? Most of the time your best friends ended up being the kids in your class or in your neighborhood. Or maybe you were best friends with kids whose parents were friends with yours.
 
As a child, making friends wasn't as complicated as it feels today. Not only were you less worried about being rejected; you also weren't as picky about who you were hanging out with. But things have changed now that you are a grown-up. Aside from the fear of rejection, making new friends takes a lot of time—something we all are a little short on these days. So instead, you lament the fact that your circle of friends is shrinking. And, you are not alone.
 
Research shows that after the age of 25, most adult friendships start to dwindle. Some of this has to do with changing jobs, getting married, moving to another state, and even having children.
 But having solid friendships as an adult is important. For instance, one study found that regardless of your marital status, people who reported having 10 or more friends at age 45 had significantly higher levels of well-being at age 50 than those with fewer friends. 
What's more, another study found that friendship quality often predicts health more so than the quality of any other relationship.
 
In fact, people with larger social circles had a 50% lower mortality risk than those who didn't. As a result, if your social circles have started to dwindle, here's what you can do to start adding more friends to your inner circle.
 
When it comes to making friends as an adult, you have to have the right mindset. For instance, you cannot go into the process thinking that you are never going to make friends. Because your perception will become your reality. Instead, follow these tips and you will be well on your way to making some lasting friendships.
 
In other words, don't overthink the process of making friends. Instead of worrying about being rejected, or dwelling on the fact that you might not be fun enough, channel your inner elementary school self. Likewise, don't assume that all your future friends have to be the same gender as you. Platonic male-female relationships are absolutely possible. Be open and inviting and see what happens.
 
Almost every person has one or two people in their life that they would like to get to know better. As a result, make a list of people you might like to hang out with sometime. Remember, making friends takes work and someone needs to take the initiative. After you have your list, consider extending an invitation for coffee and see what happens.
 
Let's face it, everyone is busy. And despite your best intentions, if you don't schedule it, you likely won't do anything about making more friends. As a result, decide when you are going to ask that friend from the office to join you for appetizers after work. Set aside time to call the woman from your book club that you really connect with. The key is to schedule these initial contacts because if you don't, you will just keep putting it off.
 
Yes, you are tired, busy, and over-scheduled. But, if someone invites you to do something, try to make it happen! If you have social anxiety, do your best to remember that this person invited you to a get together because they like you and want to get to know you better. Of course, if you cannot afford something or you are sick, then definitely decline the invite. But, make an effort to do something else together instead. Accepting invitations, even if you don't know the person very well, is a great opportunity to open doors and expand your friendship opportunities.
 
When you are looking to make friends, it's important to expand your horizons and try new things. You never know, you might just enjoy these new adventures. Plus, it will open up the possibility of making friends in new and interesting places. Take an art class or a dance class, you might not be the only one stepping out of their comfort zone and that in and of itself can be something to bond over.
 
Part of the challenge of making new friends is knowing where to look. Too many times, people assume that there are just no potential friends out there. But the problem is not the lack of opportunities for friendships, but the inability to put forth the effort to find them.
 
The purpose of social media is to connect people. Whether they live far away or you haven't seen them since high school, your social media accounts are ripe with opportunities to make friends. Of course, you are technically already ""friends,"" with them online, but if you see a friend post about something you are interested in, reach out and make a connection. You also can use social media to organize get-togethers. For instance, if you want to have a poker night at your house, post something on your social media account to see who might be interested.
 
Some of the best friends people have are their neighbors. Yet, many people don't recognize the potential friend who lives right next door. They simply give the courtesy wave across the street and then close their door. But there may be some really great friendships waiting to be made just down the street from where you live. So, the next time you are both out, do more than just wave.
 
You spend a large portion of your life with the people you work with. And despite the fact that you are in a professional setting, you likely know a great deal about one another. If this is the case for you, consider inviting one of your co-workers to do something non-work related. For instance, suggest you attend a baseball game together or grab dinner after work. Or, if you share a passion for something like yoga or cooking, suggest you do it together.
 
It seems kind of cliche to suggest meeting people at the gym. But people do it all the time. The next time you are in Zumba class or you're walking on the treadmill, strike up a casual conversation with the person next to you. Then, chat and say hello each time you see each other at the gym. Who knows? You might have the beginnings of a great friendship in the making.
 
Whether you work from home or go into an office every day, meet-ups and other networking events are a great way to meet new people—and potential friends. Not only are these events filled with people looking to connect with other professionals, but they also are great places to meet people who share the same passions. You can learn about these types of get-togethers through apps like Meet Up and Eventbrite.
 
If you love to read, joining a local book club is a great way to meet potential new friends. What's more, you will get to know each other on a much deeper level when you are discussing a book. Even if you don't meet your future best friend in your book club, at the very least you will have a group of people that you can mingle with every month.
 
If you like sports, consider joining an adult recreational league. Basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and softball are all great choices. Not only will you be doing something you enjoy and getting in some exercise, but sports teams usually go out for drinks or pizza afterward, which is a great way to get to know someone.
 
Whether you are active in a church or haven't been to one in years, churches, mosques, and synagogues are a great way to meet people who share your faith. Plus, there are usually a lot of opportunities for involvement. Whether it is a Bible study, volunteer opportunities, or a weekly potluck, churches are a great place to meet new people and make friends.
 
While volunteering is a great way to stay involved in your kids' lives, it also is a wonderful opportunity to meet new people with kids around the age of yours. And, if you are both volunteering, chances are high that you value the same things. So, look for opportunities to volunteer at the school. For instance, you could chaperone a dance or work in the school store alongside some other parents. And, who knows? By the end of the night you might just exchange numbers so that you can get together for coffee.
 
After you have established a few connections, it's important to stay in contact. Friendships are like plants. If you don't water them regularly, they will die. Consequently, make sure you are regularly reaching out to your new friends. Call or text consistently just to see how they are doing. Ask about their life. Show an interest in the things that are important to them. A good friend doesn't make the friendship all about their needs; but also takes an active interest in the other person.

Over the past several years, the popularity of online dating has skyrocketed compared to where it originally started. In fact, dating apps and websites have given single people a convenient new way to connect with people.
 
But, with this ease of use comes some new issues, particularly in the form of safety. For instance, interacting with strangers online can put you at risk for identity theft, online harassment, stalking, digital dating abuse, catfishing, and other scams. And, if you do decide to meet up ""in real life"" (IRL) with someone you met online, there also is the chance that you could find yourself in physical danger as well.
 
To make navigating the online dating scene a little easier and safer, we have compiled a list of important facts about online dating. We also have put together some tips for selecting the best app for you as well as included keys to staying safe in the online dating world.
 
Whether you are new to online dating, or you consider yourself a pro, it helps to have a clear understanding of what dating apps offer including how often they are used, how they are viewed by others, and even how honest people are when building their profiles. Here is everything you need to know about the online dating industry.
 
According to the eHarmony website, an online dating program for Christian singles, more than 40 million Americans are using online dating websites.
 40% of Americans use online dating as a way to meet new people. What's more, 27% of young adults report using online dating sites, which is a 10% increase from 2013. 
Researchers speculate that this increase is due to the fact that dating apps are now available on smartphones. Meanwhile, online dating among 55 to 64-year-olds has also risen substantially with 12% indicating they use online dating sites compared to only 6% in 2013.
 
In 2005, when the Pew Research Center first studied online dating habits, most Americans felt it was a subpar way of meeting people. But in their most recent study, nearly half of the public either knows someone who uses online dating or has met a spouse or partner through online dating. Still, 23% of Americans still think ""people who use online dating sites are desperate.""
 
To some, it probably comes as no surprise that people lie when creating their online dating profiles. But a whopping 53% of Americans tell little white lies when developing their online profiles according to a survey conducted by the global research firm, Opinion Matters. Overall, women tend to post younger photos of themselves while claiming to be thinner. Meanwhile, men tend to embellish the truth when it comes to their careers attempting to appear more successful than they really are.
 
Research suggests that many men who use online dating apps assume that women are looking for sex. But studies have shown that is not the case. For instance, the majority of Tinder's female users are looking for a genuine match and not a fling, even though the app has earned the reputation as being ""the hook up"" app. In fact, 60% of Tinder's female users are looking for a relationship and do not want to hook up, according to informal research conducted by the Huffington Post. What's more, Statistic Brain reports that only 33% of women using online dating websites say they have sex on their first date with an online match.
 
According to research conducted by Michigan State University, relationships that begin online are nearly 30% more likely to break down than relationships that began through a mutual friend or where couples met face-to-face first. And for couples who met online and then got married, the chances of that relationship working out are even gloomier, with online couples three times as likely to get divorced.
 
The Association of Psychological Science says many people treat online dating like shopping. They swipe through photos looking for the perfect mate often dismissing someone more quickly than they would have had they first met the person face-to-face. Consequently, the researchers warn that online dating can make you picky and judgmental.
 
According to Statistic Brain's Online Dating Industry Report, 20% of committed relationships began online. What's more, they say that 17% of couples that were married in the last year met on a dating website. Meanwhile, Pew Research Center reports that two-thirds of online daters have gone out with someone they were matched with. But, they also found that one-third of people who have used online dating have never actually gone on a date. So, the odds of meeting someone online are improving.
 
When it comes to selecting the best online dating app for you, reading reviews and comparing apps can get confusing, especially when the features and options not only vary widely but are constantly changing and evolving as developers change and improve the apps. And with more than 7,500 dating apps worldwide, there definitely are a lot to choose from. But, it doesn't have to be overwhelming. Follow these few simple steps to help you find the best app for you.
 
Online dating can be a risky endeavor because there are so many unknowns. Consequently, you want to be sure that the app you select has some built-in safety features. Ideally, the app will promote its safety guidelines on the sign-up page. But if they do not, or if the safety guidelines are particularly hard to find, you may want to find a different app.
 
Let's face it, when it comes to online dating, you are going to meet a few weirdos along the way - people that either creep you out or are just downright toxic. When this happens, you want to be able to report their behavior as well as block them from contacting you. For this reason, it is important to know upfront about how the app provides these features. And, if for some reason, there are no reporting or blocking features, then move on to the next app.
 
When reviewing an app, check to see if you are able to control the visibility of your profile. Ideally, you want an app that allows more options to secure your profile. The less you have, the more exposed your information is on the Internet. For instance, the app, Hinge, offers several options for users to control who they see and who sees them. Just remember, the more options an app provides in this area, the better.
 
No one likes receiving unwanted photos or creepy messages, which certainly is a possibility within dating apps. As a result, it is best to select an app that requires both people to have an interest before messaging can take place. This way, you can reduce the number of unwanted messages you get and limit it to only the people you want to be communicating with.
 
Many online dating apps use your location as a way of allowing you to find possible matches. However, make sure the app allows you to some control over this setting. It is never a good idea to have an app that allows complete strangers to pinpoint where you are or even find your specific neighborhood. Sharing that kind of information just sets you up for problems.
 
Most dating apps have both a free version and a paid version. As a result, you shouldn't shell out for the paid membership before you even know if you like the app or if it will be useful. What's more, having the free version is not going to keep you from meeting new people.
 
When you are first starting out, it can be a lot more beneficial to try several different apps to see what works rather than purchasing the premium membership before you have even taken it for a test drive. Plus, dating apps can get expensive if you are paying $10 to $25 a month for the service.
 
Most dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge allow people to share data from their social media profiles. This is mostly harmless, but be aware of how much information is revealed on your dating profile as a result.
 Remember, you do not know the people on the dating app and giving them access to your social media profile like photos of your family could be risky, especially if you are a single parent. 
You also want to keep where you went to school, where you hang out, and even your employer private. Making this information available means that even after you have blocked people through the app, they still could still find you and harass you through social media.
 
While you are never to blame if someone behaves in a predatory or disrespectful way toward you in the online dating world, there are things you can do to stay safe. Here are some useful safety tips you can put into practice right away to help you be more mindful.
 
When developing your dating profile, avoid using the same photo that you have on your social media accounts. If you use the same photo as your Facebook photo or your Instagram page, it is really easy for someone to do a reverse image search with Google. As a result, if you are using the same photo on all your accounts, it is much easier for someone to find you on social media.
 
When developing your online dating profile, make sure you do not include your last name, contact information, nicknames, or social media handles. You want to keep the personal details to a minimum. After all, if you come across someone who is a little on the creepy side, you don't want them having too much information about you.
 
You may even want to tighten the security on your social media accounts to add another layer of protection. For instance, on Facebook change your page to where everything is private and only able to be viewed by ""Friends,"" not ""Friends of Friends.""
 
When you are messaging with a potential date, or even after a few dates, it is best to message one another inside the app. Although this might be inconvenient, if something doesn't work out, you do not have to worry about the fact that the person has your cell number.
 
What's more, staying inside the app provides you with an extra layer of protection. Some messaging systems with dating apps do not allow people to send photos or links, which can really reduce the number of unwanted photos you get.
 
Eventually, you will want to talk with someone on the phone, either after you have met or beforehand. But instead of giving out your cell number, consider getting a Google phone number and forwarding it to your phone. It is pretty easy to set up. Once you log in to Google Voice, you simply choose your area code and select an available number. The instructions on the rest of the set-up process are pretty simple to follow.
 
Avoid letting someone know exactly where you live. Instead, arrange to meet in a public place and provide your own transportation. You also should let a close friend know where you will be and when you will be home. You want your friends to know as much information as possible should something go wrong.
 
Once on your date, be sure you stay aware and alert. Do not leave your drink unattended and keep the first few dates short. You may even want to bring a self-defense tool with you such as pepper spray or a high-powered flashlight. And, if the person you are meeting is making you uncomfortable or scared, enlist the help of a friend in leaving the situation. Remember, you should never feel bad about putting your safety first. Even if you have to do something rude to escape a situation, you need to make sure you are safe.

Relationship scientists define casual dating as dating and sexual behavior outside of a long-term romantic relationship, and describe it as a common relationship strategy among teenagers and young adults. In other words, casual dating is dating someone and possibly having sex with them when you are not engaged, married, or otherwise in a long-term commitment.
 Casual dating is not the same as hooking up, even though they have many things in common. Casual dating implies a desire to maintain a relationship, even though it is deemed casual. Hooking up, on the other hand, does not necessarily demand an emotional commitment on any level.﻿﻿ 
Depending on your age and particular upbringing, you might consider casual dating to be a fun way to socialize, a stepping stone toward a more long-term relationship, or an immoral relationship because of its extramarital sex component (if sex is occurring).﻿﻿ Many proponents of traditional marriage denounce casual dating as harmful and a precursor of divorce. Is it true that casual dating is harmful in the long term?
 
Relationship psychologists and sociologists have long believed that casual dating and cohabitation before marriage lead to higher divorce rates. However the connection is difficult to establish on its own (there are lots of possible confounding factors), and many studies show the opposite trend.﻿﻿
 
How you ask questions and to whom you ask questions about casual dating deeply influence the type of results you get on this topic. If you ask happy couples in both casual and married relationships, they will both show similar patterns in satisfaction and happiness. The same goes for unhappy couples.
 
In other words, evidence that shows couples as less happy and more likely to divorce could be a result of the specific couple and not the relationship style. Casual dating may or may not lead to more divorce rates in the future, depending on the person you are dating and the likelihood of a long-term relationship. Scientists can't agree.
 
Another common effect attributed to casual dating is that these non-committed, casual relationships are less satisfying than more traditional, committed relationships.
 
Research published in the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality found that although sexual satisfaction was higher for people in married, engaged, or exclusive relationships, there was still a positive link between casual dating and sexual satisfaction. Casual dating doesn't lead to an unhappy sex life.﻿﻿
 
What about general satisfaction with the relationship as a whole? The picture gets a little more complicated here.
 If you don't expect a future with the person you are dating, your relationship satisfaction will be lower than that of co-habiting, engaged, or married relationships. 
If you do hope that your casual dating relationship will turn into something more long-term, then your satisfaction will be the same as that of co-habiting or married couples. It all depends on whether you feel the relationship is coming to an end or is in danger.
 
Overall, if your expectations and attitudes towards casual dating are positive, it's likely that you'll be happy with your relationship and your sex life.﻿﻿
 
Some people also believe that casual dating leads to negative psychological effects such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Myths about the negative effects of casual dating and hooking up, especially for women, abound. What does the science say?
 
On the topic of hooking up, research over one year with undergraduate students in the United States showed that only when people hooked up for non-autonomous (""I didn't choose this"") reasons did they exhibit lower self-esteem, higher depression and anxiety, and more physical symptoms.﻿﻿
 In other words, when a person hooked up because of peer pressure, or because they couldn't consent (being under the influence of drugs or alcohol), it made them less happy. 
However, participants who hooked up because they wanted to (autonomous choice) were just as happy as the students who didn't hook up at all.
 
Whether hooking up and casual dating hurt people mentally depends on their own personal desires and attitudes toward these relationship styles. If you think that hooking up and casual dating are wrong, engaging in these things will make you feel bad. If you think that they are fun ways to meet people and explore future relationships, you will feel happy. It all depends on your point of view.
 
If you don't think that casual dating is wrong or immoral, then you are likely to find this kind of relationship satisfying. More interestingly, researchers have begun considering casual dating as a step in a progressive relationship that eventually leads to long-term commitment or marriage.
 In a world where traditional marriage is retreating, people use casual dating as a way to test sexual and relationship compatibility with partners. 
In other words, casual dating tends to be an early step toward long-term partnerships. These relationships often begin with a meeting or even hooking up. The two people may start going on dates, perhaps not exclusively at first. If there is compatibility, people then tend to become exclusive, move in together, and eventually marry and have children.
 
The difference between today's casual dating and the dating styles of previous generations is that now, casual dating more openly involves extramarital sex.﻿﻿ This may be why older, more conservative groups tend to denounce casual dating as undesirable. However, since non-marital, casual sex is widely accepted in modern societies, this attitude is less influential than it used to be.
 
While there’s no official rules when it comes to casual dating, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind to make the most of this experience for you and your partner:
 
You need to make sure that both parties understand that the dating is casual—and that you’re both okay with this. Discuss whether you do or don’t want to know about or hear about their other dates and discuss whether it’s even an option (with no pressure) for the relationship to become serious down the road. If casual sex is out of the question for you, you'll need to make this known as well.
 
Just because it’s casual, it doesn’t mean there can’t be any boundaries. Define yours. Are there certain types of people you won’t date? Do you have limits in bed, if the relationship becomes sexual? What are your rules for staying safe and protecting yourself from sexually transmitted diseases?
 
Jealousy and casual dating don’t mix. You need to be okay if you see your dating partner with someone else—either in person or on social media. If you’re having a hard time controlling your jealous tendencies, it might be a sign that you’re better off in a serious relationship. Casual dating can also be tough if you're prone to co-dependence or insecurity.
 
There are a lot of things you can do together when casual dating—beyond sex.
 
That said, don't take them as your plus-one to a wedding or party. Introducing the person to family and friends is going beyond casual dating.
 
Mutual respect is key in any relationship, casual or otherwise. If you go on a date or two and decide the person just isn't right for you, let the person know in a kind and respectful way.
 
Casual dating will hurt you only if you are doing it against your will, if you have no hope for a future with the person, or if you think it is immoral. If you enjoy the sense of freedom that comes with developing relationships with a potential partner and testing the waters before making a commitment, casual dating is one step toward finding a person with whom to possibly form a long-term commitment in the future.

Mindfulness-based relationship enhancement (MBRE) is a set of techniques used with couples who are already content with each other (i.e. not in distress) to help strengthen coping skills related to stress within the relationship.
 
All couples will face life challenges and stressors in their lifetime. As these difficult periods of life emerge, it is helpful for couples to have skills that promote working together and positive, adaptive coping strategies. That is where mindfulness-based relationship enhancement comes in.
 MBRE has been shown to be effective for boosting stress coping skills, increasing personal well-being, improving relationship happiness, and increasing stress management skills. 
The ultimate goal of mindfulness-based relationship enhancement is to learn how to be present in the moment, accepting of whatever challenges you are facing individually and as a couple, and taking your time reacting and making decisions to avoid the negative impact of hasty choices made in the heat of the moment.
 
Before we start to understand mindfulness-based relationship enhancement, it is helpful to take a step back and learn a bit about the concept of mindfulness.
 
Mindfulness refers to being in a state of focused attention and awareness of your present experience. It also involves being curious, open, and accepting of that experience.
 
When you are acting mindfully, you don't immediately react to thoughts or emotions that pass through your mind. Instead, you act as a non-judging observer who explores and acknowledges feelings without immediately reacting. In this way, the roots of mindfulness lie in Buddhist or Zen meditation.
 
How does mindfulness help you? When you learn to practice mindfulness, you are learning how to cope in all of the different areas of your life. Rather than being a skill, mindfulness is a way of approaching life and the world.
 
Mindfulness makes all things in life more pleasant, it helps you to think more clearly, aids in being ""in the moment,"" and increases your ability to cope with stressful events.
 
Mindfulness-based relationship enhancement is simply the extension of mindfulness techniques to the relationship realm. MBRE has the same purpose as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), founded by American professor of medicine Jon Kabat-Zinn, except that it is applied to couples.
 
Instead of allowing disagreements to escalate, which can happen when couples react in haste or out of anger or anxiety, MBRE teaches couples how to prevent and diffuse disagreements and conflict.
 There are four main areas on which MBRE is based as follows: 
MBRE also involves gaining insight into your own patterns of interactions in your relationship, and feelings and thoughts. It could be that you and your spouse have each fallen into negative ways of thinking or interacting with each other that could be improved.
 
What's the advantage of mindfulness in a relationship? In general, being mindful as a couple means not getting caught up in both the little annoyances of life, as well as not being overwhelmed by the larger life challenges.
 
It means being flexible and non-judgemental, accepting differences, being less reactive, and being more objective. All of these qualities, both on a personal level and as a couple, will serve you well in facing the world together—as well as simply spending time with one another.
 
The following are mindfulness-based relationship enhancement techniques that may be used as part of this set of strategies.
 
What are the established benefits of mindfulness-based relationship enhancement? There is robust and growing scientific evidence to support the positive effects of the use of mindfulness in improving relationships.
 
Some of the many benefits of MBRE include:
 
Mindfulness-based relationship enhancement can involve using strategies individually (such as practicing mindfulness on your own) or as a couple. These strategies allow you to become better in tune with yourself and your partner, to increase your empathy, and see problems that arise as challenges to be overcome rather than as threats to your relationship.
 
Think of the last time you found yourself upset in your relationship. Chances are that instead of collaboration and understanding, one or both of you were upset and being confrontational. While stress can lead to conflict and negative emotions, when you practice mindfulness, you will experience compassion and acceptance in the moment, which will improve outcomes for your relationship.
 
A 2004 study in the journal Behavior Therapy investigated the use of mindfulness-based relationship enhancement to enhance the relationships of couples who were happy and not in distress. The study showed that there were positive outcomes of MBRE in the following areas. In addition, all of these benefits continued to show at a 3-month follow-up in the study.
 Enhanced relationship satisfaction Improved autonomy Improved relatedness Increased closeness Increased acceptance of each other Lower relationship distress Increased optimism Enhanced spirituality Improved relaxation Reduced psychological distress 
A 2015 phenomenological study published in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy investigated the impact of a relationship enhancement program for couples expecting their first child.
 
This program was called the ""4-Week Mindful Transition to Parenthood Program"" and involved mindfulness practices and interpersonal activities with an aim of developing personal and interpersonal skills for being in tune with oneself and each other in a couple.
 
The study involved semi-structured interviews with 13 couples and identified four areas of improvement after the mindfulness program:
 
These study findings highlight the benefits of MBRE in terms of positive enhancements for both individuals in the relationship as well as the couple as a whole unit.
 
How can you practice mindfulness-based relationship enhancement on your own at home? One way to do this is to draw on the techniques of MBRE on your own.
 
Below is a list of quick mindfulness strategies that you can employ on your own as a couple to start adding mindfulness to your relationship.
 
Mindfulness-based relationship enhancement has a long history and proven benefits to help you build a stronger and more resilient foundation as a couple. If you are already in a happy and positive relationship, MBRE may be helpful to prepare you for the life challenges you will eventually face, such as having children, job loss, financial difficulties, illness, etc.
 
Whereas many couples may be thrown off by these events, through MBRE you will be better prepared to respond to each other in an adaptive way and be mindful of how your individual behavior affects your relationship and all areas of your life.
 Mindfulness: Learning to be non-judging of all experiences in the present moment (good and bad). This means experiencing present-moment awareness but not reacting to it. Acceptance: Learning to accept experiences as they are, which leads to increased compassion and empathy for yourself and your partner. Relaxation: Learning to generate the relaxation response, which helps to manage stress and improve feelings of well-being, clarity, and the ability to remain calm. Self-broadening: Developing a greater sense of trust, connection, and love for everyone. Partner-focused loving-kindness meditation: Loving-kindness meditation is focused on care and concern for yourself and others. It involves learning to feel pure love and opening up your mind and heart to your partner. It also reflects selflessness and breaking down barriers. Learning to be mindful of daily pleasant events: This technique involves becoming open to the present moment in a non-judging way. This allows us to notice the smaller things in life that we may not normally notice. It also promotes gratitude and being thankful for pleasant experiences. Improving intimacy through mindful touching and eye-gazing: Mindful touching and eye gazing involve touching your partner or looking into your partner's eyes and noticing whatever you feel in the moment. Increased relationship satisfaction Increased acceptance of one's partner Improved individual well-being Lowered relationship distress Increased self-reported empathy Increased ability to respond to relationship stress Improved emotional stress responses Improvements in perceptions of the relationship (before and after disagreements) More adaptive communication styles Improved relaxation response Development of a buffer against chronic stress Calming of emotional arousal Enhanced relationship satisfaction Improved autonomy Improved relatedness Increased closeness Increased acceptance of each other Lower relationship distress Increased optimism Enhanced spirituality Improved relaxation Reduced psychological distress Positive change for individuals in terms of awareness and acceptance Improvements in the couple relationship such as a deeper connection with each other Feeling more prepared for the arrival of the baby and more confident as parents More involvement and better identification on the part of fathers Disconnect. Put away your phones when you are together. Be in the moment and talk to each other. Listen actively. Rather than thinking about what you will say next, listen to what your partner says. Ask questions and be curious. Feel grateful. Notice the times when your partner makes you feel happy and feel gratitude for those moments. Be silent. Enjoy a bit of silence together. You don't always need to be talking to connect. Respond. Instead of reacting with anger or emotions, take a breath, and respond in a rational way to problems that come up or the challenges that you face together. Create a vision. Make a list of 10 to 20 ways that you want to interact with each other in the future, such as ""We support each other's growth"" or ""We do something new or fun together once a month."" Engage in caring behaviors. Ask your partner what things make them feel good, and make a commitment to do those special things on a regular basis. Examples might include buying flowers or holding hands. Daily appreciation. Make a habit of expressing appreciation for each other once a day. Take a moment free of distractions and describe to each other something that the other person did that made you feel good. See through new eyes. Slow down for a moment and see your partner through new eyes. Really notice things about your loved one that you take for granted, and fall in love all over again. Eye gazing. Take a few minutes and spend it gazing into each other's eyes. This type of extended eye gaze increases oxytocin, which is the hormone that increases bonding. Embrace. When you first see each other at the end of the day, before you say anything, embrace without talking until the point that you feel both of you relaxing. This engages the vagus nerve, which helps induce the relaxation response. Breathe together. Practice mindful breathing together, in which you slow down in the inhale and exhale. This practice will also induce a relaxation response. Mindful conversation. When you talk to each other, practice being open-minded and non-judgmental. Whether you have a deep conversation or a good laugh, be present at the moment without reacting or judging. Be compassionate. See your partner in a compassionate way. In what ways has he or she suffered? See your partner not as an enemy but as a person needing compassion. Meditate together. Find a loving-kindness meditation or another type of meditation on Youtube and practice it together. One practice that a couple can do to grow closer, that is easy and wholesome, is mindfulness meditation. Mindful touching. Spend time touching each other in an intentional way, rather than mindlessly. Be aware of what you are doing and focus on the moment. Think before speaking. Before talking to your partner, take a moment to think about what you want to say and make sure that you are clear on what you want them to know and what result you want from the conversation. Also, be aware of how you are feeling in that moment.",mindfulness base relationship enhancement mbre set techniques use couple already content distress help strengthen cop skills relate stress within

Most people reading this will have experienced a traumatic event in their lifetime. As many as 70 percent of people in the United States will experience a trauma at lease once in their lives. With so many people hurting, more therapeutic approaches are focused on being trauma-informed or trauma-focused. Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP) is one of those growing therapeutic approaches to help people heal.
 
It is suggested that people who have experienced trauma will wait approximately two years after realizing the pain of their experience before ever seeking help. Two years is quite a long time to suffer in isolation, trying to sort through the pain of a traumatic experience on your own. Even when people try to reach out for help, if at all, they might be seeking help from family or friends.
 
Although their intent is likely positive, loved ones are not necessarily equipped to help you navigate and heal from the emotional suffering of trauma.
 
Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy is described as a healing-based and transformation-oriented model of psychotherapeutic treatment. Developed by American psychologist, Dr. Diana Fosha, Ph.D., AEDP views crisis and suffering as opportunities for people to find their ability to heal and experience the transformation that might otherwise not have the chance to happen.
 
Dr. Fosha is the founder and director of the AEDP Institute in New York where she teaches clinicians and practices as a psychotherapist. As AEDP has continued to grow in recent years, clinicians from all over the world are learning this model of therapeutic treatment to better serve their clients, particularly those who have experienced trauma.
 
As with many other approaches, AEDP integrates a variety of therapeutic disciplines, such as:
 
As described by the AEDP Institute, the treatment model of Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy aims to ""help our patients, and ourselves, become stronger at the broken places. By working with trauma, loss, and the painful consequences of the limitations of human relatedness, we discover places that have always been strong; places that were never broken.""
 
There are four key pillars that offer foundational support to the model of AEDP:
 
Clinicians trained in Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy actively engage with clients throughout their healing journey. This is not a passive or removed therapeutic style, but one in which the client and the therapist are partnering collaboratively during the process. There are certain things that a trained AEDP therapist will be doing during the course of healing.
 
A secure base is a necessary part of most forms of therapy, in that it allows for an effective and healthy rapport between client and therapist. This is particularly so within the model of AEDP.
 The therapist is open and curious about the client, removed from any perceived judgment or bias that might create feelings of uncertainty. 
For many people, having someone who is genuinely curious about them and their experiences can feel new and different. It is in this new and different space that clients can begin to feel safe and open to the process of sharing their emotions and experiences with another person.
 
One of the key aspects of AEDP is to ""undo aloneness."" Most of us know the impact of feeling alone and what it can do to us when we are already in pain. Our sense of being alone leaves us feeling isolated and misunderstood, and can lead to feelings of hopelessness that things can change. AEDP therapists create safety through their active presence with clients, helping them find the courage to explore.
 
For many clients, this therapeutic experience may be the first time they have ever felt safe in their lives. Having a compassionate, emotionally safe person to join them in their exploration allows them to uncover and walk through painful experiences that may not have been accessed before. Therapists stay compassionately present as clients process uncomfortable emotions.
 
AEDP therapists are attuned to the client's experience in each session, staying aware of body movement, facial expressions, eye movements, tone of voice and more. Actively tracking clients this way can allow therapists an opportunity to help clients explore what is happening for them, even during their exploration.
 
Again, for many people, sessions with an AEDP therapist may be the first time in their lives that they have felt emotionally safe enough to explore painful experiences and emotions. Much of what keeps people from sharing is fear of how others will respond, if others will see or hear their pain, and if they will be criticized or judged.
 
All of those fears can feel removed within the AEDP experience. New experiences, like feeling seen, heard and understood by the AEDP therapist allow clients to have a corrective emotional experience.
 
Some therapeutic approaches tend to keep the mind and heart separate, or not address the heart much at all. AEDP allows therapists to maintain a balance of attuning to both the cognitive and the emotional experiences of the client. Doing so allows clients to feel integrated during their treatment, moving away from old patterns such as rationalizing or compartmentalizing their experiences.
 
Many therapeutic models focus on relieving suffering and emotional pain. Helping people feel less pain is, of course, very important in the therapy process. People seek out help when they are in emotional pain looking for hope and guidance out of those uncomfortable spaces. However, the model of AEDP doesn't stop there.
 
In research conducted by Dr. Fosha and her colleague, Dr. Eileen Russell, Ph.D., they describe that the focus on a client's positive affective experience with regard to things like transformation, growth, and connection that are long overdue. These positive experiences are just as beneficial to the process of healing and, even more so, to the process of continued growth and flourishing. In fact, Fosha and Russell suggest that in AEDP:
 
Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy is a therapeutic model that can be used with a wide variety of populations. Since the healing is based out of the platform of emotional attunement and client safety, many different presenting issues can be addressed.
 
The goal of the therapist is to actively engage and walk alongside their clients, to be curious about them and their experiences, to create a safe space for clients to explore and process their pain, as well as positive, emotional experiences.
 Beyond simply a change in behavior or attitude, AEDP focuses on healing and change on a core level. 
People can find true transformation through the AEDP therapy experience, impacting their sense of self, their sense of the world, their decision making and behaviors.
 
Not only is AEDP an effective treatment model for individuals, but couples can also benefit from Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy for Couples. Just as the energy of AEDP for individuals is focused on things like attunement, safe exploration, and corrective emotional experiences, AEDP for couples offers this same energy to partners.
 
The influence of attachment theory is certainly present in AEDP work with couples. The painful experiences that people are coming in with may or may not have to do with their partner. Couples experience all sorts of wounds in their intimate relationship such as:
 
As much as there are several ways we can show love to one another, there are just as many ways we can hurt each other, especially in committed intimate relationships. When couples begin therapy with an AEDP therapist, they may be bringing in a history of traumatic experiences that took place within their dynamic or outside of their dynamic, such as in their past.
 
The AEDP therapist walks alongside both partners, tracking and helping them to explore their experiences. Creating and maintaining a safe emotional space for both partners is critical to the process.
 
During therapy, the AEDP therapist is modeling for partners how to become curious, how to help them not feel alone in their experiences, how to stay present, and how to offer corrective emotional experiences. As you might remember with individuals, the AEDP therapist is offering the client something that they have never felt before—an experience in which they feel seen, heard, and truly understood.
 
This is called the corrective emotional experience—one that offers hurting people the space and opportunity to fully process uncomfortable emotions and even celebrate more positive emotions, with a supportive person.
 
Couples in AEDP are, essentially, learning how to do this for each other, through the modeling of interactions with the therapist as well as better understanding through their own exploration of self in the therapy process.
 
Through exploration of self, partners can better identify possible roadblocks that might be getting in the way of true intimacy and vulnerability with their partner.
 We use tactics all the time in our personal relationships to protect ourselves, often without realizing the painful impact it is having on our partner and the health of our relationship. 
Identifying and clarifying these blocks to intimacy make them much easier to challenge and remove, allowing for partners to get to know each other in new, softer and more authentic ways. Through those moments in AEDP therapy, partners are building greater levels of intimacy and growing more closely connected.
 
As Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy continues to grow, clinicians are being trained across the globe. The AEDP Institute offers a database of therapists, psychologists, and other mental health practitioners who have advanced training or certification in this model of therapy. Because there are growing populations of trained AEDP therapists, particularly in the United States, there are established regional communities that you can contact for help in locating an AEDP therapist in your area.
 
AEDP offers a formal certification program in this model of therapy to help maintain continuity in how this approach is being offered with clients. Because AEDP is a comprehensive, integrative theoretical clinical model, it is critical that therapists are trained properly with an established and consistent curriculum. The training in AEDP includes coursework, clinical experience, and supervision to help demonstrate knowledge, understanding and effective application of AEDP skills.
 
For someone to become fully certified in Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy, they must be a state-licensed professional qualified to work in areas of mental health treatment, including credentials such as:
 
Many educational training opportunities are available for clinicians and other licensed professionals who may be interested in developing skills in AEDP. Seminars, workshops, conferences, and online trainings are available. If you are a clinician interested in becoming certified in AEDP, you can find more information about training opportunities at the AEDP Institute website.
 Attachment theory Affective neuroscience Body-focused approaches Transformational studies Faith in the client's capacity for healing. This ability and capacity for healing is hard-wired within us, in our mind and body, and can be accessed. It is understood that we are all capable and that this part of us that can be accessed for healing has been locked down and hidden as a result of emotionally painful experiences. The power of being seen and understood. This is new to many clients. It helps to heal deep injuries and to create space for exploration and change. When we are used to feeling alone, isolated, and misunderstood, this new experience of being seen and heard can feel both exciting and vulnerable. It is in this space that the AEDP therapist walks alongside to help the client explore. Working through defenses quickly and effectively. This involves exploring the deepest places of wounding. Healing at these places can be most helpful in creating further change. The AEDP therapist gently walks with clients into those emotions, maintaining safety for the client and allowing them to process those levels of hurt that are often hidden from others. Discovering a newfound ability to trust and experience emotions. This means sharing with another person. Even uncomfortable emotions can be shared and processed. As clients continue to experience emotional safety throughout the counseling process, they are met with corrective emotional experiences. These are experiences that help them challenge their ideas that they are not worth knowing, that their experiences don't matter, or that they cannot heal. Clients begin to experience themselves in new ways through their process of healing. Working with positive affect is part of everyday, moment-to-moment psychotherapy in this model. It is necessary for positive emotions to be processed and regulated, just as we would do with more uncomfortable, painful emotion. Allowing positive affect to be part of the therapy work has been shown to make a big difference in improving the client's function, relatedness, and emotional resilience.

"
Most of the time, it is easy to spot the narcissist in the room. They are the ones who are working the crowd, loudly sharing fabulous stories that convey a sense of importance and accomplishment so that they can feel admired. Someone behaving like this tends to send out a clear signal to those around them that they are not approachable or compassionate.
 
Could there be other people in the room with those same exaggerated motivations for admiration and importance, yet possibly harder to identify? Yes, in fact, there could be someone close to you who is a narcissist but shows up in less obvious ways.
 Common narcissistic traits include having a strong sense of self-importance, experiencing fantasies about fame or glory, exaggerating self abilities, craving admiration, exploiting others, and lacking empathy. 
The word narcissist is a term regularly used in common discussions to describe anyone who seems a bit self-involved. However, in terms of clinical mental health, someone needs to meet a specific criterion in order to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder.
 
In general, people with narcissistic personality disorder are those who are preoccupied with their own success and with a grand sense of self-importance that influences their decision-making and interactions.
 
Narcissists find it difficult to build or maintain connections with others because of their manipulative tendencies and lack of empathy. They often feel entitled and lack compassion, yet crave attention and admiration.﻿﻿ Here are some elements of narcissism.
 
In the field of psychology, behavior can be described as overt or covert. Overt behaviors are those that can be easily observed by others, such as those of the traditional narcissist described earlier. Covert behaviors, however, are those that are more subtle and a bit less obvious to others.
 A covert narcissist is someone who craves admiration and importance as well as lacks empathy toward others but can act in a different way than an overt narcissist. 
When considering the behavior of narcissists, it might be hard to imagine how someone could be a narcissist and be inhibited in their approach and behavior. A covert narcissist may be outwardly self-effacing or withdrawn in their approach, but the end goals are the same.﻿﻿
 
For example, this might be described as listening to your favorite song while blasting the volume, compared to listening to that same song on a low volume. The song itself hasn't changed, just the volume in which you are listening.
 
Covert narcissists are only different from overt (more obvious) narcissists in that they tend to be more introverted. The overt narcissist is easily identified because they tend to be loud, arrogant, and insensitive to the needs of others and always thirsty for compliments.﻿﻿
 
Their behaviors can be easily observed by others and tend to show up as ""big"" in a room. When we think of an overt narcissist, we could say they demonstrate more extroverted behaviors in their interactions with others.
 
Researcher and author Craig Malkin, PhD suggests that the term ""covert"" can be misleading. In his work he states that the term covert is often used to suggest that the covert narcissist is sneaky or that their strive for importance is not as significant as an overt (more extroverted) narcissist. In fact, he reports, the traits of the overt narcissist and the covert narcissist are the same.
 Both covert and overt narcissists navigate the world with a sense of self-importance and fantasizing about success and grandeur. 
Both individuals need to meet the same clinical criteria to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, whether they are extroverted or introverted. Both have deficits in their capacity to regulate their self-esteem.﻿﻿
 
Many people have fallen victim to the manipulative behaviors of a covert narcissist without realizing what has happened until they are already in emotional pain. It might be more accurate to suggest that the extroverted (overt) narcissist would be a lot easier to see coming than the introverted (covert) narcissist.
 
It is not unusual for people to find themselves in long-term relationships with covert narcissists only to be hurt by a sense of a lack of partnership or reciprocity in the relationship.
 
Although there are some clinical criteria that need to be met in order for someone to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, there are some general traits and patterns to look for in everyday interactions if you suspect you might be dealing with a covert narcissist.
 
Being aware of these traits can help empower those who are interacting with the covert narcissist, helping them to recognize and better navigate potentially unhealthy interactions.
 
Where the more overt, extroverted narcissist will be obvious in their elevated sense of self and their arrogance when interacting with others, the covert narcissist may be less obvious.
 
The covert narcissist certainly craves importance and thirsts for admiration but it can look different to those around them. They might give back-handed compliments, or purposefully minimize their accomplishments or talents so that people will offer them reassurance of how talented they are.
 The reality for both the overt and covert narcissist is that they have a fragile sense of self. 
The overt narcissist will demand admiration and attention, where the covert narcissist will use softer tactics to meet those same goals. The covert narcissist will be much more likely to constantly seek reassurance about their talents, skills, and accomplishments, looking for others to feed that same need for self-importance.
 
Shaming others is a wonderful tactic of the narcissist in order to secure their sense of an elevated position in relation to others. The overt (extroverted) narcissist might be more obvious in their approach to gaining leverage, such as explicitly putting you down, being rude, criticizing you, and being sarcastic.﻿﻿
 
The introverted, covert narcissist may have a more gentle approach to explain why something is your fault and they are not to blame. They might even pretend to be a victim of your behavior or engage in emotional abuse to put themselves in a position to receive reassurance and praise from you.﻿﻿ At the end of these interactions, the goal of the narcissist is to make the other person feel small.
 
Although not always sneaky, some covert narcissists can take joy in creating confusion for someone they are interacting with. They may not engage in blaming or shaming, but instead, causing people to question their perceptions and second-guess themselves.
 
Another way to create leverage between them and another person, the covert narcissist needs to use tactics like this to elevate themselves and maintain power in the interaction. If they can get you to question your perceptions, then this allows them the opportunity to manipulate and exploit you more.
 
Because their need for self-importance reigns supreme, covert narcissists will do whatever they need to do in order to keep the focus on themselves. So, where an extroverted narcissist will blatantly push you aside or manipulate you to accomplish their goal, the covert narcissist is a professional at not acknowledging you at all.
 
It is not a coincidence that narcissists, in general, tend to gravitate toward interacting with caring and compassionate people. The covert narcissist recognizes those opportunities for manipulation as well.
 They have no problem letting you know that you are not important. 
Rather than explicitly telling you that you're not important, they might stand you up on a date, wait until the last minute to respond to texts or emails, always show up late for events with you, or never make confirmed plans with you at all. There is no regard for your time or interests, leaving you feeling small, unimportant, and irrelevant.
 
Narcissists are inept at building and nurturing emotional bonds with others. How could they know how to do maintain bonds with others if their energy is always focused on themselves? The covert narcissist is no different. So, although they may appear kinder and less obnoxious than their extroverted counterpart, they are not emotionally accessible or responsive either.
 
You will likely not receive many compliments from a covert narcissist. Remembering that they are always focused on staying elevated to maintain their sense of self-importance, it is easy to understand how a covert narcissist would find it difficult to compliment you. There is usually little regard for your talents or abilities—usually, the narcissist has no regard for these things at all.
 
Just as with overt narcissists, you will likely find yourself doing most of the heavy emotional lifting in a relationship with the covert narcissists. Although the covert is more likely to appear emotionally accessible, it tends to be a performance and usually done with intent to exploit or eventually leave the person feeling small through disregard, blaming, or shaming.
 
Since one of the hallmark traits of narcissistic personality disorder is lack of empathy, the covert narcissist is not going to be emotionally responsive to their partner in a healthy way.﻿﻿
 
In general, narcissists are not givers. They find it difficult to put energy into anything that doesn't serve them in some way.﻿﻿ A covert narcissist might present themselves in a way that looks like they are giving, but their giving behavior is only demonstrated with the intent of getting something in return.
 
A simple, everyday example could be something like putting a tip in the jar at your local coffee shop. A covert narcissist would be much more likely to put their tip in the jar when they know the barista is looking, in order to help facilitate some kind of interaction that allows them to be praised for giving.
 The intent of giving for a covert narcissist is always more about them and less about those to whom they are giving. 
You may currently be in a personal relationship with a covert narcissist, whether it be a family member, a coworker, or your significant other. It may be helpful to note that although we cannot control with the narcissist does, we can take control of how we are behaving and interacting with them. There are certain steps that you can take to protect yourself if having to deal with a covert narcissist.
 
When we are dealing with a narcissist, whether covert or overt, their manipulative behavior can feel very personal. The lack of regard, sense of entitlement, patterns of manipulation, and deceptive behaviors of a narcissist can feel very personal when we are on the receiving end of their ways.
 
No matter how painful the impact of the behaviors of a narcissist might feel in the moment, it is important to remember that it has nothing to do with you.
 The narcissist is behaving in negative ways because of something unhealthy within them, not because there is something unhealthy about you. 
It is okay to look at the situation and the interactions in regard to how you contribute to them. However, it is very important when dealing with a narcissist that you let them ""own"" their part.
 
The narcissist wants you to take it personally because that is how they maintain leverage. Remember, a narcissist feels small, so they have to make themselves ""big"" somehow.
 
Narcissists do not have healthy boundaries.﻿﻿ Because covert narcissists lack empathy, have a strong sense of entitlement and exploit others, boundaries are something that get in the way of their goals. The more you can practice setting boundaries with the narcissist, the more consistently you are conveying to them that their tactics are not working.
 
Setting boundaries can be very difficult, especially if you have never done that before. Not only is it possibly unfamiliar to you, but setting boundaries with a covert narcissist can be pretty intimidating.
 
Remember that boundaries are just a way for you to let someone else know what your values are. Consider what is important to you, what your values are, and work to create boundaries to support them.
 
Understanding why you are setting particular boundaries can help you have more confidence in establishing them and can keep you on track if a narcissist attempts to violate or disregard your boundaries.
 
When interacting with a covert narcissist, it can be easy to lose your voice. Because the patterns of interaction are so manipulative, it may take time for you to realize that the relationship left you in this place of not knowing how to advocate for yourself.
 
Take time to tune back in with yourself, who you are, what you are about, your values, your goals, and your talents. Strengthening your relationship with yourself is key in being able to speak up during interactions with a narcissist.
 When advocating for yourself, the narcissist gets a chance to meet the part of you that is aware and knowledgeable of their tactics, making it less appealing for them to keep trying those things with you. 
Being in a relationship with a covert narcissist can feel frustrating and overwhelming. There are times when it can be difficult to create distance between you and that person, such as with a family member or coworker. However, there might be opportunities for you to create some healthy distance between you and the narcissist.
 
Limiting personal interactions, asking to be moved to a different location in your office, taking breaks at a different time, or simply cutting off contact might be what is necessary if you are feeling hurt by someone's narcissism. Remember the goal of creating distance is not to hurt the person who is narcissistic. The goal is to protect yourself and create space for you to heal.

Think about your daily interactions with people. When you go to the store, for example, you follow a certain script—a series of steps—to interact with the cashier. These kinds of scripts are generally known by everyone within a culture when they are children, and they are intended to make social interactions easier. We don't need to think about what we should say or do in specific situations—we have scripts all ready to go in our heads. These scripts also apply to courtship and dating.
 Courtship scripts are among the most tenacious and inflexible ones that we have. 
For example, imagine that a man asks a woman on a date, and when the check comes, the woman pays for both of them. Although it's not unheard of, it might sound a bit weird. We all tend to expect that the man is going to pay, or at least that they're going to split the bill. These unspoken and assumed expectations around what is acceptable or ""what people do"" during a date are what courtship scripts are.
 
But courtship scripts are not always good for everyone. In a world where gender roles and relations are changing quickly, norms around dating are apparently not changing as fast. This has negative consequences for everyone, but mostly women. What can history and science tell us about courtship to help us make it more enjoyable for everyone?
 
It's hard to imagine dating being any other way than what we know, but the 20th century actually saw a lot of changes in the way people date. Beth Bailey, a historian, writes about the history of the date and how it has evolved throughout history.
 
During the 1920s and 1930s, something called ""the dating and rating complex"" existed, and this is what framed the dating experience.﻿﻿ People who wanted to date had to appear popular. To be popular, men had to show signs of wealth with things like a nice car and nice clothes. Women, on the other hand, had to appear as if they were overwhelmed with demands for dates. The busier her social calendar, the more popular she appeared, and the more likely she was to be asked for a date.
 
Men had to ask women out weeks in advance, and women had to appear shocked at any last-minute request for a date. In this system, marriage was not the goal. This eventually changed, but dating was not meant to help you find a partner to marry. It was previously about participating in youth culture.
 
After World War II, things changed drastically. Instead of the social butterfly, the ideal dating scenario became ""going steady"" for couples. Post-WWII, marriage became idealized as the end goal of dating. Teenagers in high schools began developing ""steady"" symbols, like a girl wearing a boy's letter sweater. These symbols were very different from school to school across the United States.
 
Dating was seen as preparation for marriage at 18 years old for girls and 20 years old for boys. This meant that children as young as eight years old were encouraged to date. This is when the idea that men and money would equal women's sexual attention took root in dating culture.
 
With the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, however, those rigid conventions of decades prior started breaking down. Although we still contend with the idea of equating money and sex today, this is less of an accepted rule now than it was before the 60s.
 
Have we reached fully equal courtship scripts yet? Not quite.
 
In a journal called Sex Roles: A Journal of Research, dating is defined as ""a publicly-expressed practice undertaken by romantically interested partners for the purpose of getting to know one another better."" The purpose of Eaton and Rose, authors of this research, was to evaluate whether dating has become more egalitarian over the last few decades.﻿﻿
 In short, dating has not become more egalitarian. For heterosexuals at least, courtship and dating are still rigidly defined along gender lines. There are certain things that men and women must (or must not) do. 
Eaton and Rose found only slight variations in the script when women ask men out for a date, but otherwise, the gender roles remain unchanged. Women are expected to resist sex for at least a couple of dates. Men are expected to pay for the first few dates and to pursue the woman.
 
When looked at from an egalitarian perspective, courtship scripts as we know them today support many sexist beliefs.
 
Some of these beliefs include ideas around men being ""aggressors"" and sex-oriented, while women should be ""picky"" and limit sexual activity until a man is invested. Women are advised to let men make the decisions unless they really have to object. If a woman does dare to ask a man on a date, there is a script that indicates she is only looking for sex.
 
In other words, traditional gender roles of men as providers and aggressors, and women as nurturers and passive recipients of advances are still assumed within dating and courtship scripts. This hurts people of both genders.
 
A woman who acts too aggressively is easily labeled as a ""slut,"" for instance, and a man who lacks aggressiveness instantly becomes ""less of a man"" in the eyes of both his male peers and the women around him.
 Believing in specific datings scripts, especially the sexual double standard, has been linked to sexist attitudes in both men and women by more research by Paynter and Leaper in Sex Roles: A Journal of Research. 
This means that people who act according to these scripts are more likely to believe things such as the idea that women should stay at home with the kids, or men cannot show emotions other than anger.
 
Thankfully, when you know about the script, you can change it. When you start dating a person, it's important to talk about your beliefs and assumptions about what men and women should be or do. If you have an open discussion with your partner(s) about what kind of dating you'd like to engage in, it's easier to make things work for you than if you just act according to unspoken assumptions.
 
Scripts are useful for smoothing out social interactions, but they can be harmful. When it comes to intimate relationships, it's worth taking some time to assess what sorts of expectations you have and to figure out whether or not they are sexist. If you truly want to respect and treat your partner(s) like an equal, it's important to get rid of sexist attitudes.

While narcissism is a personality trait that has been around for a long time, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and narcissistic personality traits have been in the public eye more often in recent years. As awareness increases, people are wondering if they are dealing with a narcissist rather than someone who is simply selfish, thoughtless, or overly power-seeking in a more general way.
 
Narcissists are a specific type of person and dealing with them is never easy. That’s why it helps to know when you have one in your life and what to expect from interactions with them. This knowledge, recognition, and understanding can provide you with some clues as to how to deal with them in the safest way possible.
 
It's important to note that those with narcissistic traits aren't necessarily diagnosable with the personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Personality disorders are stable maladaptive patterns of behavior.
 
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), a personality disorder involves at least two of the following four areas: cognitive (thought patterns), affective (emotional patterns), interpersonal (patterns of relating to others), and impulse-control-based. 
 
Personality disorders create an impairment in how people function in their lives and affect an estimated 10% of the population in the U.S., though there are different types of personality disorders. This means that not everyone who has some of these traits is diagnosable with this personality disorder, but they may have a less severe form of this pattern of behavior that can still be problematic and difficult to deal with.
 
While there is only one official diagnosis for narcissists, there are different ""variants"" of narcissism or different types of narcissists, and narcissism comes in varying degrees of severity.
 
A 2012 review of the research on narcissism identified several of these variants including grandiose narcissists, who seem to require excessive praise and attention, and vulnerable narcissists, who tend to have a lot of anxiety and need a lot of supportive attention. 
 
Among the variants of narcissism, however, malignant narcissists are by far the most damaging. Beyond merely wanting to focus primarily on themselves and be held in overly high regard by virtually everyone in their lives, they tend to have a darker side to their self-absorption. 
 
This subset contains the general traits of NPD including the regular egocentricity, but also some antisocial traits and even a sadistic streak as well as a poor sense of self and lack of empathy. There is often some paranoia involved with malignant narcissism as well. 
 Some experts see little difference between malignant narcissists and psychopaths in that both have antisocial behavior and low empathy. 
Malignant narcissists can be highly manipulative, and they don't care who they hurt as long as they get their own way. They see the world in black-and-white terms, including seeing others as either friend or foe. They seek to win at all costs and generally leave a great amount of pain, frustration, and even heartache in their wake.
 
They generally don’t care about the pain they cause others—or may even enjoy it and experience it as empowering—and will do what it takes to prevent themselves from loss, inconvenience, or failing to get what they want in any situation.
 
While not every person who displays narcissistic traits is a classic “narcissist” in the sense that they have the diagnosable condition of NPD, even those who fail to meet the criteria for diagnosis can create a lot of harm with the traits they do possess.
 
Further, it’s unethical for a trained therapist to diagnose friends and family with NPD (due to potential bias), and it’s certainly not an official diagnosis for a layperson to view the diagnostic criteria and decide that someone they know has a psychological disorder.
 Narcissists generally resist therapy (which can include diagnosis) because they tend to be happy—far happier than those in their lives because they don’t face the negative consequences of their disorder; their targets do. 
Because discomfort is what generally brings people to therapy, narcissists themselves rarely seek treatment or diagnosis, which means that sometimes we can’t have a firm diagnosis for someone who has NPD, but we can recognize that they “probably” have it based on how closely they appear to fit the criteria.
 
It helps to know this because their behavior can sometimes feel unpredictable but actually does follow a somewhat predictable pattern if you know what to look for.
 
The following is an abbreviated summary of the diagnostic criteria for NPD according to the DSM-5, which is the industry standard for diagnosis of psychological conditions:
 
Again, while a clinical diagnosis can't be made from observation from friends and family, it helps to be familiar with the criteria as it can provide an idea of how close someone might be to fitting the profile. A less clinical, simpler way to tell if someone in your life may have narcissistic tendencies is to look at signs and symptoms, which are observable traits and behaviors that tend to go hand-in-hand with disorders.
 
Signs and symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and the severity of symptoms vary. People with the disorder, particularly malignant narcissists, generally:
 
If the description of a narcissist sounds familiar and has you concerned, this is probably a good thing. Knowing that you may be dealing with someone who could hurt you and having some concern for yourself in this situation can help you to protect yourself from the pain that a malignant narcissist can cause, at least to an extent.
 
How does one deal with NPD in a loved one (or in someone they must deal with, like a boss or co-worker)? Fortunately, they are somewhat predictable, so there are a few guidelines that can help: 
 
Life with a narcissist will never be easy, so it's simplest if you can put distance between yourself and this person. However, if this person is a family member or co-worker, this can be more difficult. In this case, it helps to know who you are dealing with and how to handle communication in as healthy a way as possible.
 A grandiose sense of self-importance A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love A belief that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by or should associate with similar high-status people and organizations  A need for excessive admiration A sense of entitlement or unreasonable expectation of special treatment or extreme loyalty  A tendency to use others for their own needs or wants A lack of empathy, or unwillingness/inability to recognize and honor the needs and feelings of others Proneness to envy or having a belief that they are envied by others A sense of arrogance shown in behaviors and/or attitudes Are highly manipulative Are often preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate Aren't able to handle criticism and lash out if they feel slighted in any way Aren't opposed to taking advantage of others to get what they want Care quite a bit about their appearance and can come across as quite charming Exaggerate their own achievements and talents, even to the point of lying Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it, and will discount any evidence that doesn't support their belief of their own superiority Fail to see or value the needs and feelings of others Have a poor sense of self and weak ability to regulate their feelings and actions Have no remorse for hurting others and rarely apologize unless it will benefit them in some way Insist on having the best of everything and believe that they deserve this Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior Secretly feel insecure and have a week sense of self Tend to project their bad behavior onto others, meaning they may accuse you of the very behavior they are conducting Accept that they will be difficult to deal with. Put some distance between yourself and them whenever possible. This may be challenging as those with narcissistic traits tend to have poor boundaries and resent when you try to set them, but it is healthier for you. Do not try to change them and don't expect them to change or you will be disappointed. Know that if you challenge them directly, they will likely retaliate in any way they can. This may include bringing others into the situation and attempting to turn them against you. This doesn't mean that you agree with whatever the narcissist asks of you, but you may want to find less confrontational ways to communicate your boundaries or disagreements. If you do need to confront the person, try not to do so in front of a large audience or they will want to save face and will feel more threatened, sparking more retaliation. Surround yourself with supportive people as much as possible to absorb some of the negativity you may experience with this person.",narcissism personality trait around long time narcissistic

Most of us don't like to think about ""power"" when we think about relationships. Intimate relationships involve sharing and cooperation — but it takes two to share and cooperate. What if one partner doesn't want to?
 
Whoever wants less of a relationship has more power.﻿﻿ The most obvious example of this principle is divorce. It just takes one person to end a relationship. It doesn't matter how much the other partner wants the marriage to work.
 
This basic principle can be seen in many smaller interactions. Dinner and a movie? Only if both partners want to. Sex? That too works best when it is consensual and cooperative. Certainly, sex is not always consensual, but relationships don't usually last long after marital rape or other forms of non-consensual sex.
 
What makes non-consent such a potent tool? Not only does it put the non-consenter in the position of decision-maker, but it also sends a clear message that ""my desires are more important than yours."" For the partner who wants more from a relationship, this can be a devastating message to receive. It suggests that, for the future, the non-consenting partner will have the option of choosing to withhold or grant cooperation, affection, and support — with no regard for the needs or desires of the other member of the relationship.
 
There are really only three possible responses to non-cooperation in a relationship.
 
If this is the case, then how do relationships last? Trust is an essential component.﻿﻿ When we trust our partner we are, in part, trusting that they won't leave. We are also trusting that our partner will consider our needs and desires when making decisions that will affect both partners. This trust is built gradually. If someone proves trustworthy in small ways we then take the risk of trusting them with even more.
 
Human relationships are about much more than power. These relationships are about intimacy, friendship, love, respect, curiosity, contentment, sharing, communication and much more. Despite this, it's still true that whoever wants less of a relationship has more power. In a good relationship, power shifts back and forth, as each partner considers the other's needs and takes or cedes power accordingly.﻿﻿
 The first is to accept the decision of the non-consenter, whatever it may be, in order to maintain at least a semblance of cooperation and mutuality. This option, while it may be acceptable for a period of time, cedes control completely. For most people, it is not a viable long-term solution. The second is to fight for cooperation — a risky choice for someone who strongly desires a relationship. The third is to walk away, saying — in essence — ""If you choose not to support me or join me, I'll go it alone or find someone else to give me the support or companionship I need.""﻿﻿ While this option may seem like the most promising, it can also be the most difficult for a person who relies on an existing relationship for security and self-esteem.",like think power think relationships intimate relationships involve share cooperation take two share cooperate one partner want whoever want less relationship power obvious example principle divorce take one person end relationship matter much partner want marriage work basic principle see many smaller interactions dinner movie partner want sex work best consensual cooperative certainly sex always consensual relationships usually last long marital rape form non consensual sex make non consent potent tool put non consenter position decision maker also send clear message desire important partner want relationship devastate message receive suggest future non consent partner option choose withhold grant cooperation affection support regard need desire member relationship really three possible responses non cooperation relationship case relationships last trust essential component trust partner part trust leave also trust partner consider need desire make decisions affect partner trust build gradually someone prove trustworthy small ways take risk trust even human relationships much power relationships intimacy friendship love respect curiosity contentment share communication much despite still true whoever want less relationship power good relationship power shift back forth partner consider need take cede power accordingly first accept decision non consenter whatever may order maintain least semblance cooperation mutuality option may acceptable period time cede control completely people viable long term solution second fight cooperation risky choice someone strongly desire relationship third walk away say essence choose support join alone find someone else give support companionship need option may seem like promise also difficult person rely exist relationship security self esteem

The end of a relationship is never easy. Breakups are filled with raw emotions, including everything from hurt and betrayal to anger and sadness. But, just because heartbreak may feel like the end of the world, the reality is that the pain and anguish you feel right now is only temporary. Eventually, you'll be able to move on—and one day you'll find love again.
 
In fact, research indicates that it takes about 11 weeks to feel better after a dating relationship ends, according to a study published in The Journal of Positive Psychology. Meanwhile, a separate study found that it may take up to 18 months to heal if it's a marriage that ends. Either way, neither situation goes on forever.
 
Just remember that getting over heartbreak and moving on is a grieving process that looks different for everyone. Consequently, don't hold yourself to any set timeframe. There are a lot of factors that impact your healing including how long you were together, the memories and traditions you shared, and even if you had children together. But you will get through it.
 
Relationships with others form the foundation of a person's life. As a result, when you lose a relationship, especially one that you considered important and central to your life, it's like losing a part of yourself. It is not uncommon to feel like you have lost your sense of meaning and purpose in life. You may even feel like you lost a huge part of yourself. And, in some respects you did. You will not be the same person you were when you were with your ex.
 
But, if you wallow in that feeling of loss and shaken identity for too long, you will end up clinging to your past and desperately trying to ""fix"" the relationship so that you can get your ex—and yourself—back.
 As difficult and painful as it might be to accept, you have to let that part of you and your life go. It's part of the past. Yes, it is hard. But you can do it. You can take the steps needed to get on with your life. 
Getting over someone has a lot more to do with how you think about the breakup, your ex, and even yourself, than it does following trying to erase the pain you are feeling. Consequently, as you navigate the muddy waters of your breakup, you need to continually remind yourself that this is a process, not a destination.
 
Not only do you need to be patient with yourself, but you also need to take this time to really think about who you are, who your ex was, and why your relationship didn't work out. Learning from this experience will not only make you stronger, but it also will help you know what you want in a relationship and maybe have more success the next time around. Here are some steps to processing your breakup and getting on with your life.
 
Getting over an ex is a process. It is not something you can rush through. What's more, you should avoid rebound dating at all costs. While going out immediately after a breakup may put a band-aid on your pain, it won't cure it. And as hard as it might be, you have to face your feelings and deal with them in honest and effective ways.
 
Sure, this process stinks. It takes a lot of time, energy, and hard work to process your feelings and emotions. But in the end it will be worth it because you will come out stronger and better than you were before.
 
No one enjoys experiencing pain. But the fact of the matter is, you have to allow yourself to feel if you are going to heal. Ignoring your feelings, pretending like they don't exist, or trying to numb them in some way, is only going to set back your recovery. Be honest about the hurt, pain, and rejection you are feeling. There is no shame in being sad.
 
Chances are you spent a good portion of your life with this person and breaking up is bound to cause some very strong emotions. It's only when you take an honest look at how the breakup made you feel, that you will be able to navigate through your emotions in a healthy way.
 
It's rare that people come to a decision to end the relationship at the same time. So, when a breakup occurs, one side is usually shocked and hurt. Consequently, these feelings of shock, rejection, hurt, and even betrayal can be difficult to navigate, especially alone.
 
Talk to your friends about how you are feeling. Just be careful not to dwell on your breakup every time you talk. Be a considerate friend and sincerely ask about their lives as well. If you find that you need more support than what a friend should be expected to provide, consider talking with a therapist, counselor, religious leader. They are trained to help people navigate breakups.
 
Nothing will set your healing back more than stalking your ex on social media. Every time you see a post with their smiling face, it will be like ripping a scab off the wound. The bleeding and pain start all over again. So, unfollow them and remove them from all your accounts.
 Even though it is tempting to see what your ex is up to, making a clean break is better for your healing process. 
There is a certain amount of peace and comfort that comes from not knowing what they are up to and who they are spending time with. Allow yourself that.
 
Nothing's worse than getting drunk and texting or calling your ex to ask what went wrong. Usually, when people are intoxicated, they lose their filter and you are likely to say some things that you will regret in the morning. For this reason, you may want to remove your ex's contact information from your phone and delete their email account from your computer. Better yet, avoid drinking excessively all together.
 
Drunk dialing your ex never turns out the way you might hope, and in the morning you are likely to experience shame and embarrassment. What's more, your ex could share your voicemail messages or text messages with other people further compounding your embarrassment. For your sake, you should avoid situations like this at all costs.
 
Take an objective look at what the relationship was really like. To do this, you will have to stop idealizing your ex and stop dwelling on the good memories and experiences. While it is natural to look at the past through rose-colored glasses, it is not reality.
 Choose to take an honest look at your relationship. You could start by making a list of all the things your ex did that annoyed you. What you may discover is that your ex wasn't as awesome as you thought. 
Perhaps you were involved in an emotionally abusive or financially abusive relationship. Maybe your ex was controlling or struggled with jealousy. Whatever issues existed, be sure you remind yourself of those instead of focusing only on the good things.
 
Just because your partner has ended a relationship does not mean that you are unworthy or unlovable. As a result, you need to focus not on what you might have done wrong, but instead focus on what you can do to feel better in the moment. This might mean taking time every day to pamper yourself in some way.
 Get a massage. Read a good book. Enjoy a cup of hot chocolate. Take a long bath. Whatever makes you feel comforted and cared for, now is the time to do that if you can. 
However, this is not the time to drink excessively, binge on fast food, or call off work repeatedly. In the end, those things will not make you feel better. They are temporary fixes and in the morning your pain and discomfort will still be there.
 
If your identity was so wrapped up in your relationship with your ex, now is a perfect time to rediscover who you are. Find out who you are outside the context of the relationship. Rushing to fill the void you are experiencing without knowing who you are and what you want is a huge mistake. It's also a recipe for disaster and ultimately more heartache.
 
Many times, relationships fail because couples are not compatible or have different goals or needs. Make sure you take the time to discover who you are and what you want.
 
Sometimes it's helpful to pour out your heart with pen and paper. In fact, it can be downright cathartic to journal your thoughts. So, grab a journal and start writing. You may even want to write a letter to your ex expressing all your thoughts and feelings. Just don't send it. The simple process of writing out how you feel as if you are talking to them is very healing on its own.
 
Besides, what you write in your letter most likely is not something you will want to share a week or two from now. Right now, your feelings are raw. Get them out, but keep them to yourself.
 
Holding on to anger, resentment, and blame is not healthy. It will eat you up inside. Instead, focus on letting go of your anger and blame. Remind yourself that forgiveness is not about forgetting. It is about freeing yourself from being tied to your ex. When you hold onto anger and resentment, or if you blame your ex for the breakup, these feelings keep you tethered to them. And, you cannot heal as long as you're still connected—even if the emotions connecting you are negative.
 
As a result, focus on letting go of your anger and stopping the blame game. Instead, train your eyes on the future and focus on how you want things to be different in your life the next time around.
 
Contrary to popular belief, a breakup does not have to be a bad thing. They actually can be a good thing, especially if you are no longer in a toxic relationship. So, instead of focusing on the negatives surrounding the breakup, look for ways to turn it into a positive.
 
For instance, does being single allow you more time to pursue your passions or volunteer for a worthy cause? Can you take that trip you have always dreamed of taking? Look for ways to be thankful the relationship has ended rather than dwelling on the pain. When you do, then you will begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel and being single won't seem like such a horrible thing.
 
As hard as it might be to see this right now, you will have another relationship—if you want one. You can meet new people and date again. Do not allow yourself to fall into the trap of believing that this person was your soul mate and now you will be alone forever.
 There is no such thing as one person for you. Dating and relationships are about making choices and there are plenty of people to choose from. If you remind yourself that on a regular basis, you will be less devastated over time. 
Eventually, you will be back out there dating again if you want to be. And, even if you choose not to, that's fine too. You are never be defined by your relationships. You have the same value and worth in life regardless of whether you are in a relationship or doing life alone. You matter and make a difference in the world. Never forget that.

"
We've all heard the saying, ""a watched clock never moves."" But, a more accurate statement might be, ""a watched smartphone never pings."" Seriously, there is nothing more anxiety-provoking than being ""left on read"" when you text someone—unless maybe it's seeing the text bubble that someone is typing and then never actually get a response. In fact, countless studies have shown that texting can create a great deal of anxiety.﻿﻿
 
Research also suggests that texting has the power to both help and hinder﻿﻿ your relationships. Whether you use texting to keep in touch or you use it to avoid difficult situations, texting is both a good thing and a bad thing. In other words, texting has the power to bring people closer together or to create distance depending on the underlying motivations of the people doing the texting.
 When it comes to relationships, researchers have discovered that it's not how often people text one another that matters, but how ""text compatible"" they are. 
Scientists also have discovered that aside from being a functional way to communicate, texting allows people to escape their present situation. People text because they are bored or because they feel it's a better way to express themselves rather than talking on the phone or in person.﻿﻿
 
But, there's a risk that texting could become a crutch too. And, when this happens it becomes a barrier to creating meaningful relationships with other people. Additionally, texting frequently can come from a place of loneliness, which only exacerbates the issue by further alienating and isolating the texter.
 
As mentioned previously, texting has the power to be a good thing. But, issues crop up when it becomes your main mode of communication. Too many times there is a lot of miscommunication that takes place. When this happens, it can alter the entire course of the relationship. Here are some ways in which texting impacts relationships.
 
Texting a compliment, a funny meme, or a positive comment, will make the person on the other end feel closer to you and more satisfied with the relationship. Consequently, be sure you're regularly sending encouraging notes to your partner and limiting texts about picking up milk and other mundane tasks.
 
Anytime one partner texts the other excessively, this is a warning sign. For instance, texting non-stop could indicate that one partner is clingy and needy and feeling insecure in the relationship. While this is usually only harmful to the person doing the excessive texting, it can be smothering to the person on the receiving end. Additionally, you want to link yourself with someone who is secure and doesn't need you to give them worth or meaning.
 
Other times, excessive texting is an early warning sign of digital dating abuse. Excessive texting—especially when it involves demanding to know where someone is, who they are with, and what they are doing—is controlling and abusive.
 If you're in a relationship with someone who texts excessively or aggressively, you may want to distance yourself from them. 
While you might think that sending sexy messages, nude photos, or sexts in a relationship helps spice it up and keep things interesting, research has shown that relationships involving excessive sexting usually experience more conflict.﻿﻿
 
Partners also were more likely to be ambivalent about the relationship's long-term potential and report lower levels of commitment and attachment. A sexy picture or note every now and then is totally fine if it's consensually sent and received; but avoid sending these types of messages in excess. In-person intimacy is always a better option.
 
People are constantly sizing up one another's behavior, and texting is a primary way in which people begin making evaluations about the relationship early on. When you just start seeing someone, their texting habits can be both intriguing and baffling at the same time. Here are some common mistakes people make when texting in relationships.
 
If there's a problem in the relationship, you should never try to resolve it through text messaging. Texting is not a conflict resolution tool. Instead, arrange a time to talk to one another in person.﻿﻿ By doing so, you'll have a much more meaningful conversation because you can see each other's expressions and hear each other's tone of voice. These things are vital parts of healthy communication.
 When using text messages to communicate about sensitive issues, it's risky that things will be misinterpreted. 
One or two questions shows that you have interest in a person. But asking too many questions can start to feel like an interrogation. And when this happens, the person on the receiving end can start to feel defensive. Limit your questions to just one or two. There will be plenty of time to ask questions in person as the relationship progresses.
 
Generally speaking, your texts shouldn't be too long. Ideally, you want to keep their length to about that of a tweet. Sending long texts can be annoying to the people on the receiving end, especially if they're busy at work or trying to complete a project.
 
That being said, there are circumstances in which more in-depth conversations can be had over text. Just make sure you aren't relying on text messaging as your primary form of communication.
 
Not texting when you're angry should go without saying. Yet, many people still make this mistake. If you're angry or you just had a disagreement, put your phone down. Not only will you probably regret what you type, but there's also no way your text is going to be interpreted the way you want it to be.﻿﻿ So, take some time to cool off and then speak to one another in person to resolve the issue.
 
When it comes to texting friends and partners, it's important to be respectful of their schedules. Refrain from sending text messages super early in the morning or late at night. While many people keep their phones on silent while they sleep, it's more considerate to wait until regular hours to send someone a text.
 
Researchers have discovered that it isn't specifically what you text or how you text your partner that creates satisfaction in the relationship.
 It's your ""texting compatibility"" that actually predicts relationship satisfaction. In other words, when both partners approach texting in the same way, they make for a happier couple. 
Not surprisingly, text messages from someone who texts at the same rate and pace you do will be welcomed in your inbox. But if you're partnered with someone who texts too much, or even too little, you'll eventually become annoyed. Here are three telltale signs that you and your partner are text compatible.
 
It doesn't matter whether you type long paragraphs to one another or you type a few short sentences, as long as they are roughly the same, you are compatible. Meanwhile, there's nothing worse than pouring your heart out in text and only getting a one or two-word reply in response. Likewise, if you prefer short text messages, receiving a long text can be annoying.
 
In the beginning stages of a relationship, couples are hyper-aware of who initiates each text. So, as the relationship progresses, if one person initiates all the contact it signals that there's some texting incompatibility present. Ideally, both partners are initiating contact with equal frequency. It's when they are unbalanced that there's a problem.
 
This type of texting is equivalent to small talk. You text each other just to say hello or to check-in. Or, maybe you text one another funny memes or links to interesting articles. When this type of texting occurs in a relationship, it's actually a positive sign and a good indicator of overall relationship satisfaction.
 
If you're frequently disappointed in the way your partner responds to you via text, then take some time to talk about it. Although discussing your concerns won't necessarily bring about changes, you'll at least gain a better understanding of where your partner is coming from. This way, the next time you get a text that irritates you, you'll understand the motivation behind it and not take it too personally.

The day your last child leaves home, whether for college, a job, a marriage or any other reason, is as big of a change in the life of a parent as it was when you welcomed your first baby into your home. The way you think about yourself and the priorities you have — being a parent and putting your children first — is no longer who you are or how you need to think about your life. Empty nesting is the end of a phase of your life, but it's also an exciting new beginning.
 
It's possible that you are looking at your empty nest and feeling sad and depressed, missing your children terribly and wishing you could go back and do it all over again. Instead of wishing for what was, it's time to start planning and dreaming of what's to come.
 If you are a new empty nester, give yourself time to adjust and feel the loss of your day-to-day joy of raising your children — but start to think about what you would like to do next.  
Many empty nesters don't know where to begin to fill the time they had devoted to the care of their children. A good place to start is to look back to when you were a child and what you enjoyed doing for play. Maybe you loved to draw or spent hours creating colorful images in coloring books. Perhaps you were always first in line to audition for a school play. You may have loved to play kickball or tennis. You may have created elaborate tales about your dolls or stuffed animals. Why not revisit those activities and pick up a paintbrush, volunteer at a local theater, take a few tennis lessons, or write a short story?
 
Parenting requires a great amount of time spent in and around the home and community. You've now moved on from being scheduled and committed every day. Now is a great time to get out and see the world.
 You can now go on long-imagined trips without worrying about childcare. Vacations no longer need to be taken with your kids' school responsibilities in mind. 
Weekends, which can seem empty and endless without children's activities to attend or plan for can now be a time to explore local areas that you haven't visited before, or take a day trip somewhere you've always wanted to see. 
 
Planning for the future as an empty nester can seem overwhelming and impossible to imagine. Your big family home can become a museum of your past without some changes. You may be interested in downsizing, or you may just want to freshen up your decor a bit. Either way, the process of reimagining your living space is not only exciting but also a great way to shift your thinking from the life of a parent to the life of an empty nester. If nothing else, you should close your kids' bedroom doors for a while and practice walking past them without feeling blue.
 Downsizing is a wonderful way to not only let go of some of the pain of empty nesting by leaving the family home and living someplace new, but it also can free up finances to allow you to pursue other interests. 
You may want to buy an RV or a sailboat, or you may just want to put money away for your retirement. Whatever you want to do, it's exciting to be able to plan for what you want to happen, not what your children need.
 
Before we have children we imagine what our lives will be like while we are raising our families. We know there is a timeline of events — from infancy to toddlerhood, pre-school to elementary school, middle school to high school to college. Many of us — most of us — don't see life past that when thinking about the future — but there's still a lot of time and a lot of possibilities ahead of us. Life after raising kids can be as fulfilling, exciting and happy as you want it to be - it takes a little dreaming and a little planning to make it happen.

Complaining about your partner's behavior is common in any long-term relationship. For instance, she complains to him that he doesn’t spend enough time with her. He complains to her about her over-spending. This song plays over and over, and the one on the receiving end has gotten quite adept at tuning it out. It can be incredibly frustrating when your complaints fall on deaf ears.
 
What if there was a way to both express and hear each other’s complaints more effectively? Perhaps in a way that you both could take it in and make real changes instead of ignoring, dismissing or getting defensive. My guess is you would both be shouting hallelujah from the mountaintop!
 
Effectively complaining isn’t that hard. In fact, there are three simple steps to follow. These steps will help minimize the potential for conflict.  
 
1. Express Your Feeling First
 
Expressing the feeling first is critical because your feelings are not debatable. Feelings are your truth--the reality of how you experience the world. However, you must get to a relatively calm and collected state before beginning to talk about this.
 
Once you are less agitated, find a neutral moment to speak with your spouse. When you start in this way, it engages your partner in the conversation. Marriage researcher Dr. John Gottman likes to call this a “softened start-up.” This often involves naming your core emotion. Core emotion means what underlies the reactivity. For example, you are likely feeling hurt or sad beneath the anger and frustration. It can also be about how you think you are viewed by your partner. This might be something like you believe you are “unimportant” to him. 
 
Starting the complaint this way reduces the chances of a fight starting. The complaint will also come across less as a criticism. You are making it about you, not just blaming.
 
2. Be Specific
 
Once you state how you feel, you can begin to describe the specific behavior or situation that is bothering you. Describing the exact behavior also keeps the focus where it should be. Instead of attacking the character or your spouse as a person, you are expressing dislike for a particular way she acts or something he does. Examples of specifics are things like showing up late, not keeping a promise or leaving dirty clothes all over the floor.
 
You also should focus the most on what is really changeable. All relationships have some unsolvable problems. Usually, this involves personality traits. Don’t ask someone to change something impossible. Learn to accept those things!
 
3. Say What You Need
 
Ask for a particular behavior that your spouse can do to right the wrong. The key is to make it something positive and doable. You should be able to envision your spouse physically doing the behavior you’re wanting. Examples of need are showing up on time, following through on what you promise and putting dirty clothes in the hamper.   
 
Let’s say your complaint is about spending time together. If you put it all together, you might say something like this:
 
I feel neglected [feeling] when you don’t make an effort to plan date nights [behavior]. I would like for you to plan something once a month for us [need].
 
4. Offer to Make Changes Too
 
This piece is optional but can add even more power to your complaint. You can ask your partner if there is anything they would like for you to change. What might be bothering your spouse? With this, however, you must make every effort to follow through on the change as well. For the long-term health of your marriage, embrace changes that will benefit you both.
 
The most difficult part of using this formula will be to not get emotionally triggered so that your complaint is still really coming through as a harsh criticism. This is crucial because research has found criticism to be one of the top predictors of divorce.
 
Complaining effectively provides a better chance for you to be heard and responded to. It minimizes the likelihood that your spouse will feel the need to defend, shut down or counter-complain back to you. It increases the chance of reaching a resolution together.  
 
All coupes have complaints about each other. Successful couples have figured out how to adequately state their complaints. They have also learned to accept some parts of their spouse that they realize will not change. And finally, they also know how to keep the big picture in mind by not overly focus on the negative.

Mental illness is very hard on a marriage or any relationship. The stress can often reach a crisis level. You can fall into a pattern where managing the illness becomes a role around which the relationship is centered. Mental illness does not have to destroy a marriage or partnership, even with the stress and focus it brings. In spite of the obvious challenges, there are ways to maintain a healthy relationship when your partner has a mental illness.
 
If you're in a relationship with someone who has been diagnosed with a mental illness, give these tips a try.
 
For a newly diagnosed person, this news can be devastating, embarrassing and even frightening. The uncertainty and stigma associated with mental illness can cause the sufferers to worry that you may not love or desire them, and may no longer want to be married to them.
 
It’s important to let your partner know that you are there for and love them “in sickness and in health.” This reassurance will go a long way toward strengthening his or her determination to get professional help. On the other hand, a negative reaction from you can potentially exacerbate symptoms of the mental illness and bring on additional feelings of hopelessness.
 
Many people are uninformed about mental illness or rely on inaccurate information. There is a lot of misinformation about the causes and best treatment options for different mental health disorders.
 
The absolute best plan of action is to seek out high-quality psychological and medical professionals, then seek out literature and online information about the particular diagnosis from legitimate sources only. Websites that you rely on should have good reputations or come recommended by your psychotherapist or physician.
 Symptoms of mental illness can be off-putting and confusing. It is easy to think that your partner is distant, lazy, distracted, irritable, or irrational. Some of these “character flaws” might actually be symptoms of mental illness. 
The effective treatment combining therapy and medication is crucial. Mental health professionals can also educate you about what role you can and should play in your partner's treatment plan. Organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), or Mental Health America (MHA) are also very good sources of practical information, resources, and support.
 
Beyond educating yourself on how to help your partner, it is not your responsibility to be their therapist. This will not work in the long term for either of you or for the rest of your family. This is inappropriate even if you are a trained mental health professional. Let the outside experts do their job with your partner. Your role is to provide love, support, and sympathy for your partner during their recovery efforts.
 
Furthermore, those with mental illness are responsible for managing their illness, so that they can be healthy and productive as partners and in other areas of life. You should not become their “crutch” or their enabler. They must take responsibility (as much as possible) for their own treatment plan and well-being,﻿﻿ and for how their illness will affect you and others.
 
Therapy can help you can process your feelings in a healthy way, both for your own coping and as a way to communicate with your partner. Counseling is a fantastic resource to help gain perspective, guidance, and equilibrium in a situation that can otherwise quickly get out of hand.﻿﻿
 As the partner of someone with a mental health condition, it is not unusual to experience a range of scary emotions that you think you should not be having, feelings such as hate, frustration or anger. Emotional exhaustion is not unusual. 
Such painful emotions can be explored in a productive way with proper counseling. Couples can learn to establish expectations and healthy boundaries.﻿﻿ Couples counseling can help prevent you from falling into unhealthy dynamics. For example, the ‘healthy’ partner runs the risk of blaming everything that goes wrong on the partner with mental illness. This is not productive for either of you.
 
Self-care is not selfish, but a necessity if you have a partner with mental health problems.﻿﻿ If you don’t focus on your own health, you are at risk of being sucked into the vortex of the mental illness, putting your relationship at risk. Go back to the basics: get enough sleep, do some regular physical activity, eat well, spend time with friends or loved ones, and engage in activities or hobbies that you enjoy.
 
Be very careful about getting to the point where you experience “caregiver fatigue” or burn-out.﻿﻿ This is a common scenario when dealing with an ill or disabled partner. It is critical to take care of your own health.
 
Life can throw major challenges into your relationship if your partner is diagnosed with mental illness. Ask yourself if you are responding well to this new scenario, and to other challenges in your life. Are you stepping up in a way you that you are proud of or are you avoiding doing your part to help your partner, your family, your relationship, your marriage, and yourself?
 
Successful couples do not allow mental illness to destroy their marriage or relationship but instead view this circumstance as a challenge to be managed and overcome. Both partners must be responsible for themselves and have a healthy response and reaction to unexpected or problematic situations to thrive. You can both make adjustments so that the new reality of the partnership becomes a manageable and happy situation.

Most people assume that if they were being verbally abused they would know about it. After all, verbal abuse often involves yelling, put-downs, name-calling, and belittling behaviors. But there is so much more to verbal abuse than people realize. In fact, some people are verbally abused on a regular basis without even recognizing that it’s happening.
 
When someone is being verbally abused, the person attacking them may use a combination of both overt forms of abuse like engaging in name-calling and making threats but also more insidious methods like gaslighting or constantly correcting, interrupting, putting down, and demeaning them. Even prolonged silent treatment is a form of verbal abuse. When this happens, the person is attempting to control and punish the victim by refusing to talk to the other person.
 
For some people, especially those who either experience verbal abuse in the home or experienced it as a child, it can often be overlooked because the verbal assaults feel like a normal way to communicate. But they are anything but normal and can have lasting consequences.
 
Because verbal abuse isn’t as clear-cut as other forms of abuse and bullying, like physical bullying and sexual bullying, it can be hard to identify. But that doesn’t make it any less real.
 Typically, verbal abuse involves some sort of verbal interaction that causes a person emotional harm. 
For instance, when someone is being downright critical, acting out in anger, and using words to try to control another person, this is verbal abuse. This, in turn, leaves a victim questioning who they are. In fact, it is not uncommon for a victim of verbal abuse to feel inadequate, stupid, and worthless. After all, they are being defined by a verbally abusive person.
 
If verbal abuse occurs in a dating relationship, it can be particularly confusing because the partner is likely not abusive all the time. As a result, when the abuser is loving and gentle the victim can forget all the about the negative behavior. Ultimately, the victim ends up ignoring the pattern of verbal abuse or makes excuses for the behavior saying things like the abuser is just stressed out or going through a tough time right now.
 
Just like any other form of abuse or bullying, verbal abuse has a lasting impact on victims. Consequently, they can experience a host of issues, including everything from anxiety and depression to even PTSD in severe cases.
 A number of studies have shown that children who are verbally abused, either at home or by their peers at school, are at a greater risk for depression and anxiety as adults.﻿﻿ 
Verbal abuse also can cause the victim to believe very negative things about themselves, which in turn impacts their self-esteem. It also can impact every element of their life, including their academic performance, their other relationships, and their success at work later in life. In fact, when verbal abuse is particularly severe it can impact whether or not people can see themselves as being successful in any area of life. 
 
When it comes to physical bullying, cyberbullying, and sexual assault, victims do not question whether or not they have been abused. These types of abuse are obvious. But when it comes to verbal abuse, victims often question whether or not what they are experiencing is truly abusive. They also wonder whether or not it is a big deal.
 
Here are some signs that a family member, friend, peer, or dating partner is verbally abusive.
 
They call you names. Anytime someone engages in name-calling this is a form of verbal abuse. Even if the names are said in a neutral voice, this is not acceptable treatment of another person.
 
They use words to shame you. Examples include critical, sarcastic, or mocking words that are meant to put you down. These may be comments about the way you dress, talk, or your intelligence. Basically, shaming is any comment that makes you feel inferior or ashamed of who you are. 
 
They make jokes at your expense. Typically, verbally abusive people will make you the butt of their jokes. This can be done in private or in person. But if you don't find it funny, then it is not harmless fun. What's more, verbally abusive people usually select jokes that attack an area where you feel vulnerable or weak.
 
They humiliate you in public. When you are insulted in public by a peer, a friend, a family member, or a dating partner, this can be particularly painful.
 The goal of the abuser is to control you by making you feel bad about who you are. 
They criticize you. Whether done in public or in private, criticism can be painful particularly if the person doing the criticizing is simply being mean and has no intention of being constructive. 
 
They yell, scream, or swear at you. Any time someone yells or curses at you, this is a display of power and the goal is to control and intimidate you into submission. As a result, it is abusive and should not be tolerated or excused. 
 
They make threats. No threat should ever be taken lightly. When people make threats they are trying to control and manipulate you. Remember, there is no better way to control someone than to make them fearful in some way.
 
Although the effects of verbal abuse can be significant, there is still hope for victims. In fact, once a person becomes able to recognize verbal abuse in their lives, they can start making informed decisions about which friendships and dating relationships are healthy and which are toxic, fake, or abusive. They also can learn to stand up to verbal bullying. Remember, verbal abuse doesn't have to leave a lasting impact. With intervention, victims can overcome and cope with the bullying they have experienced.

Although adults often say things like, “He was so young when that happened. He won’t even remember it as an adult,” childhood trauma can have a lifelong effect. And while kids are resilient, they’re not made of stone.
 
That’s not to say your child will be emotionally scarred for life if he endures a horrific experience.﻿﻿ But it’s important to recognize when your child may need professional help with dealing with trauma. Early intervention may even prevent your child from experiencing the ongoing effects of the trauma as an adult.﻿﻿
 
There are many different experiences that can constitute trauma. Childhood trauma is an event experienced by a child that threatens their life or bodily integrity. Physical or sexual abuse, for example, can be clearly traumatic for children. One-time events like a car accident, natural disaster (like a hurricane), or medical trauma can take a psychological toll on children as well.﻿﻿
 
Ongoing stress, such as living in a dangerous neighborhood or being the victim of bullying, can be traumatic, even if it just feels like daily life to an adult.﻿﻿
 
Childhood trauma also doesn’t have to occur directly to the child. For instance, watching a loved one suffer can be extremely traumatic as well. Exposure to violent media can also traumatize children.﻿﻿
 Just because an experience is upsetting, however, doesn’t make it traumatic. Parental divorce, for example, will likely affect a child but it isn’t necessarily traumatizing. 
Many children are exposed to traumatic events at one point or another. While most of them experience distress following a traumatic event, the vast majority of them return to a normal state of functioning in a relatively short period of time. Some kids are much less affected by their circumstances than others.﻿﻿
 Between 3% and 15% of girls and 1% to 6% of boys—develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic event.﻿﻿ 
Children with PTSD may re-experience the trauma in their minds over and over again. They may also avoid anything that reminds them of the trauma or they may re-enact their trauma in their play.
 
Sometimes children believe they missed warning signs predicting the traumatic event. In an effort to prevent future traumas, they become hyper-vigilant in looking for warning signs that something bad is going to happen again.
 
Children with PTSD may also have problems with:﻿﻿
 
Even children who don’t develop PTSD may still exhibit emotional and behavioral issues following a traumatic experience. Here are some things to watch out for during the weeks and months after an upsetting event:﻿﻿
 
Traumatic events can affect how a child’s brain develops. And that can have lifelong consequences.
 
A study published in 2015 showed that the more adverse childhood experiences a person has, the higher their risk of health and wellness problems later in life. Childhood trauma may increase an individual’s risk of:﻿﻿
 
A study published in 2016 in Psychiatric Times noted that the prevalence of suicide attempts was significantly higher in adults who experienced trauma, such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, and parental domestic violence, as a child.﻿﻿
 
A child’s relationship with his caregiver—whether his parents, grandparents, or otherwise—is vital to his emotional and physical health. This relationship and attachment helps the little one learn to trust others, manage emotions, and interact with the world around them.
 
When a child experiences a trauma that teaches him that he cannot trust or rely on that caregiver, however, he’s likely to believe that the world around him is a scary place and all adults are dangerous—and that makes it incredibly difficult to form relationships throughout their childhood, including with peers their own age, and into the adult years.﻿﻿
 
Children who struggle to maintain healthy attachments to caregivers are likely to struggle with romantic relationships during adulthood. A 2008 Australian study of more than 21,000 child abuse survivors age 60 and older reported a higher rate of failed marriages and relationships.﻿﻿
 
Family support can be key to reducing the impact trauma has on a child. Here are some ways to support a child after an upsetting event:
 If you or a loved one are struggling with childhood trauma, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Depending on your child’s age and needs, she may be referred for services such as cognitive behavioral therapy, play therapy, or family therapy. Medication may also be an option to treat your child’s symptoms.﻿﻿
 
It’s never too late to get help. Whether you’ve adopted a teenager who was abused over a decade ago, or you’ve never received help for the traumatic experiences you endured 40 years ago, treatment can still be effective.

If you were abused or not properly cared for as a child, and you now struggle with overeating, you are not alone. Many others who suffered from childhood abuse and neglect have gone on to develop Binge Eating Disorder (BED), a problem with over-eating commonly known as a type of food addiction, in adulthood. Feeling and saying, ""I hate my body"" is extremely common, especially for people who were abused in childhood.
 
If you suffered from childhood abuse, and you struggle with over-eating, you may have developed overly negative feelings about yourself, also known as low self-esteem. Problems with low self-esteem are particularly common among people who were emotionally abused as children. It can be hard to believe this, as so many people put on a brave face to the world, but low self-esteem can take its toll on people from all walks of life. Low self-esteem affects many people, whether or not they were abused, and sometimes leads to or is made worse by overeating or other addictive behavior.
 
In fact, low self-esteem is such a common problem that almost any counselor you see will be able to help you to overcome these negative feelings about yourself. Often, low self-esteem is based on an unrealistic view of yourself, especially if you were abused or mistreated as a child. Counseling, whether it is specialist counseling for overeating or addiction or regular counseling with a general counselor or psychologist, can help you see yourself in a more realistic light, so you can come to appreciate things that make you feel good about yourself.
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
It is not unusual for people, particularly women, to feel dissatisfied with their bodies these days. Many blame the fashion and diet industries for promoting unrealistic ideals of what people should look like. Even models are unable to live up to these impossible standards, needing designer clothing, excessive makeup, and clever camera and airbrushing techniques to achieve the fantasy of perfection we see in magazines.
 
Some binge eaters have particularly negative feelings about their own bodies, so much so that it can be a part of the problem. Research has also shown that binge eaters who were emotionally or sexually abused are particularly likely to be unhappy about their bodies, even more so than binge eaters whose childhoods were instead plagued by physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect.
 Feeling bad about your body may actually be making your tendency to overeat worse. 
As with low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction is a problem that counselors and psychologists face with their clients on a daily basis, so reaching out for help will be met with understanding and support. Because your poor image of your body is based on unrealistic standards, a counselor or psychologist can help you recognize your own unique beauty, that is based on who you really are, not on clever tricks, make-up, or a perfectly proportioned or skinnier body.
 
Research has also helped uncover the reason why people who were emotionally or sexually abused generally have more depressive symptoms and greater body dissatisfaction, and more severe problems with binge eating. It seems that self-criticism is the crucial factor that drives some binge eaters to feel so negatively about their bodies.
 
One way of understanding this pattern is that people who were emotionally abused as children experienced harsh criticism from their abuser, which they then turned on themselves, becoming their own harshest critic. This happens whether or not depressive symptoms develop, although depressive symptoms may intensify the effect of self-criticism on negative body image.
 People who were sexually abused often develop a negative body image due to being treated as sexual objects by their abusers, at a time when they were still developing an understanding of their own bodies. 
Having treatment for sexual or emotional abuse can change the way you talk to yourself so that you become your own best friend, rather than your own worst enemy. Writing your own affirmations is one way that you can begin to change the way you talk about yourself right away, and can have a lasting effect on the way your ""talk"" to yourself in your own head.
 
We know that there is a strong association between childhood abuse and binge eating disorders, as well as between childhood abuse and other eating disorders, addictions, and mental health problems. We even know that the type of abuse or neglect binge eaters experienced when they were children had a significant effect on their negative body image in adulthood. Nonetheless, this is not proof that childhood abuse causes these problems in later life.
 
Dr. David Dunkley and his colleagues, who carried out a study with 170 overweight adults who wanted help with binge eating, and whose problems were not otherwise explained by a significant physical or mental disorder, showed the mechanism by which the link between childhood abuse and body dissatisfaction is facilitated by self-criticism.
 
But although self-criticism has a profound effect on negative body image, it is impossible to tell from this research whether child abuse actually causes self-criticism, body dissatisfaction, or binge eating. The only way to find this out would be to track people over time, starting in childhood.

Drug and alcohol use has long been linked to domestic violence, but the exact role of substance abuse plays in triggering violent events is not clear. The general consensus seems to be that alcohol and drug use may act as a catalyst in escalating conflicts into a violent outburst but isn't the actual cause of the behavior.
 
Alcohol can play a part in domestic violence because it can impair the abuser's judgment, reduce inhibition and increase aggression. There have been many studies done on the relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence and the prevalence of alcohol abuse during a violent episode has been reported from 25 percent to 80 percent.
 If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential assistance from trained advocates. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
But there is no scientific evidence indicating a cause-and-effect relationship between substance abuse and intimate partner violence.
 
What then does trigger violent episodes among intimate partners? What does cause a perpetrator to launch a violent attack?
 
A new approach to researching domestic abusers and their victims may be the key to finding the most common trigger for a violent episode. By listening to actual telephone conversations between perpetrators who have been incarcerated for felony domestic violence (violence that resulted in serious injury) and their victims, researchers have been able to determine exactly what triggered the violent episodes.
 
Julianna Nemeth and other researchers at Ohio State University listened to hours of audio recordings of telephone conversations between male abusers who were in jail and their female victims. The researchers were trying to determine the immediate precursor of the violent episode -- ""the one thing that happened right before the violence,"" she wrote.
 
What the researchers found was that violence most often followed an accusation of sexual infidelity made by one or both of the intimate partners. Drug and alcohol use was often involved in these incidents, but not always.
 Previous research has shown that sexual jealousy played a role in domestic abuse, but the Ohio State scientists were surprised to find that this particular type of jealousy—infidelity accusations—was the trigger that most often initiated the violence. 
Other studies have found that even when subjects are intoxicated, some still do not become violent or aggressive unless they feel threatened or provoked. Suspicion of infidelity could certainly provoke feelings of being threatened.
 
""I have worked in domestic violence intervention for many years, but still the findings shocked me,"" lead author Nemeth wrote. ""We never knew that it was the accusation of infidelity that tended to trigger the violence.""
 
Along with the accusation of infidelity as the main trigger for a violent outburst, the telephone conversations reveal a variety of other relationship stressors that also contributed to the intimate partner abuse. They include:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. 
The Ohio State researchers concluded that counselors and advocates working with domestic abuse victims who are trying to assess how much danger the victim may be in should ask specifically if accusations of sexual infidelity have been discussed by the couple.
 
""It is a red flag that the relationship may be volatile,"" they wrote.
 
They also suggested that healthcare providers working with abuse victims should also screen for drug and alcohol abuse as well as mental health issues.
 
Previous studies have also recommended linking substance abuse and domestic violence services. Although there are different opinions about what role drug and alcohol abuse plays in intimate partner violence, research has shown that providing substance abuse and domestic abuse services together can have a positive impact on ending the abuse.

Studies have demonstrated over and over that childhood abuse and neglect results in permanent changes to the developing human brain. These changes in brain structure appear to be significant enough to potentially cause psychological and emotional problems in adulthood, such as psychological disorders and/or substance abuse.
 If you are a victim of child abuse or know someone who might be, call or text the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453 to speak with a professional crisis counselor. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Dr. Martin Teicher and his colleagues at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Northeastern University, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to identify measured changes in brain structure among young adults who had experienced childhood abuse or neglect.﻿﻿
 
There were clear differences in nine brain regions between those who had suffered childhood trauma and those who had not. The most obvious changes were in the brain regions that help balance emotions and impulses, as well as self-centered thinking.
 
The results indicate that people who have been through childhood abuse or neglect have a higher risk of substance abuse if they go down that path because they have a harder time controlling their urges and making rational decisions due to actual physical changes in their brain development.
 When people experienced three or more types of abuse (sexual, physical, verbal, neglect), 53% suffered from major depression at some point in their lives. 40% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
There are many negative effects of childhood abuse and neglect on how the brain develops. Some of these potential effects are:﻿﻿
 
Because childhood abuse, neglect, and trauma change brain structure and chemical function, maltreatment can also affect the way children behave, regulate emotion and function socially. These potential effects include:
 
How childhood abuse or neglect affects an adult depends also on how often the abuse occurred; what age the child was during the abuse; who the abuser was; whether or not the child had a dependable, loving adult in her life as well; how long the abuse lasted; if there were any interventions in the abuse; the kind and severity of the abuse; and other individual factors.

Unfortunately, accusations like child abuse happen quite often. Particularly in high-conflict custody battles, tempers can escalate quickly and both parties are bound to feel the strain. In some situations, one parent may be tempted to believe that accusing the other parent of child abuse will increase their own chances of winning child custody. But it's a flawed strategy.
 
It’s true that judges err on the side of caution when it comes to children’s safety. However, judges do not favor limiting parental rights unless it's absolutely necessary—and they're well aware that false accusations are made often. As a result, any and all claims of abuse will be thoroughly investigated by the court.
 
Moreover, if a judge determines that a parent has made a false allegation in an attempt to influence a child custody decision, they may order the accusing parent to pay court costs to the other parent—and even modify the custody arrangement in favor of the accused. So even though plenty of parents try it, making false allegations in an attempt to win child custody rarely pays off. 
 
In cases of alleged abuse, the judge will thoroughly investigate each claim before awarding custody or visitation. This often leads to time-consuming and expensive examinations by medical and mental health experts, which can be especially burdensome for children. 
 
Family protective services, at the order of the judge, may also become involved in the investigation. This can become quite intrusive. For example, child protective services staff questions people close to you about your behavior and your parenting. 
 
Comply with the investigation and be as cooperative as possible. Gather relevant evidence to support your case. This may include statements by family members, co-workers, friends, or neighbors—anyone who can vouch that you are a loving parent and would never harm your children. While it may turn into a game of ""he said, she said,"" having the support of others will help the judge see that you are not abusive.
 
Let the people closest to you know what is going on and encourage them to speak openly and honestly about your parenting abilities when interviewed by child protective services or court personnel. Your supporters can also provide written statements to the court regarding your abilities as a parent.
 
Simply having people who can state that they never saw you mistreat or threaten your children will help your case. If no evidence of abuse is discovered, the investigation will be closed and the court will officially determine that either no abuse took place or it cannot be confirmed.
 
While judges do not want ​to take children away from their parents, they err on the side of caution when it comes to any type of domestic abuse and child custody. The proper course of action will depend on the nature of the allegations and a number of other factors.
 
Typically, a judge may suspend the accused parent’s right to visitation and/or custody pending an investigation. When that investigation fails to uncover evidence of abuse, the accused parent’s rights will be reinstated. In addition, if the judge determines that the accusation was unfounded, they may order the accusing parent to pay court costs, including attorney’s fees, to the other parent. 
 
However, any time that you're accused of child abuse, you should consult with an attorney experienced in handling similar cases. Particularly if an investigation does not clear your name, you'll want to work with a family law attorney who can help you gather additional evidence, build a case for appeal, and advocate on your behalf—so that the truth can be fully revealed and your parental rights can be reinstated.

When most people think of domestic abuse, the first thing that comes to mind is likely verbal abuse and physical assault. But research shows that financial abuse occurs just as frequently in unhealthy relationships as other forms of abuse.
 
In fact, a study by the Centers for Financial Security found that 99% of domestic violence cases also involved financial abuse.﻿﻿ What's more, financial abuse is often the first sign of dating violence and domestic abuse. Consequently, knowing how to identify financial abuse is critical to your safety and security.
 
Financial abuse involves controlling a victim's ability to acquire, use, and maintain financial resources. Those who are victimized financially may be prevented from working.
 
They also may have their own money restricted or stolen by the abuser. And rarely do they have complete access to money and other resources. When they do have money, they often have to account for every penny they spend.
 
Overall, the forms of financial abuse vary from situation to situation. Sometimes an abuser may use subtle tactics like manipulation while other abusers may be more overt, demanding, and intimidating.
 In the end, the goal is always the same—to gain power and control in a relationship. 
While less commonly understood than other forms of abuse, financial abuse is one of the most powerful methods of keeping a victim trapped in an abusive relationship. Research shows that victims often are too concerned about their ability to provide financially for themselves and their children to end the relationship. Plus, financial insecurity is one of the top reasons women return to an abusive partner.﻿﻿
 
The effects of financial abuse are often devastating. Victims feel inadequate and unsure of themselves due to the emotional abuse that accompanies financial abuse. They also have to go without food and other necessities because they have no money.
 
In the short-term, financial abuse leaves victims vulnerable to physical abuse and violence.﻿﻿ Without access to money, credit cards, and other financial assets, it's extremely difficult to do any type of safety planning.
 
For instance, if an abuser is particularly violent and the victim needs to leave in order to stay safe, this is difficult without money or a credit card. And if they need to leave the relationship permanently, it is challenging to find safe and affordable housing. They also struggle to provide for basic needs like food, clothing, and transportation.
 For those who do manage to escape an abusive situation, they often face extreme difficulties in obtaining long-term housing, safety, and security.﻿﻿ 
Victims often have spotty employment records, ruined credit histories, and mounting legal issues caused by years of financial abuse. Consequently, it's very difficult for them to establish independence and long-term security. In fact, many victims stay with or return to abusers due to concerns about financial stability.
 
Overall, financial abuse is very isolating because victims often become financially dependent on their abusers. This financial dependence traps them in the relationship. Without resources, they are unable to see a way out of their situation.
 It's extremely important that women can identify financial abuse before it escalates and they're stripped of their credit histories and employment opportunities. 
Following is an overview of the way financial abuse is perpetrated. Some abusers may use all of these tactics while others may only use one or two. Regardless of whether the abusive person is using one tactic or 10, it's still considered financial abuse. Here are some ways in which people are abused financially.
 
When a dating partner or spouse uses or controls the money you have earned or saved, they are exploiting your resources. Here are some examples of this exploitation.
 
When a dating partner or spouse attempts to control your ability to earn money or gain assets, they are interfering with your income potential. Here are some examples of job interference.
 
When a dating partner or spouse has complete control over the money in the relationship and you have little or no access to what you need, this is controlling the family resources. Here are some examples of controlling shared resources and assets.
 
If you suspect that your partner or spouse is financially abusive, contact an advocate, a counselor, or a religious leader right away. Financial abuse is not something that gets better with time. In fact, it often escalates and can lead to other types of abuse.
 If you do not have a counselor or religious leader who can help, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential assistance from trained advocates. The key is to address financial abuse right away. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.

If you know or suspect that someone is a victim of domestic violence, you might feel clueless about the best way to help. Don't let a fear of saying the wrong thing prevent you from reaching out. Waiting for the perfect words could keep you from seizing the opportunity to change a life.
 
The world for many domestic abuse victims can be lonely, isolated, and filled with fear. Sometimes reaching out and letting them know that you are there for them can provide tremendous relief.
 If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential assistance from trained advocates. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Use the nine tips that follow to help you support someone in this vulnerable situation. 
 
If you decide to reach out to an abuse victim, do so during a time of calm. Getting involved when tempers are flaring can put you in danger. Also, make sure to set aside plenty of time in case the victim decides to open up. If the person decides to disclose years of pent-up fear and frustration, you will not want to end the conversation because you have another commitment.
 
You can bring up the subject of domestic violence by saying “I’m worried about you because …..” or “I’m concerned about your safety…"" or ""I have noticed some changes that concern me...""
 
Maybe you've seen the person wearing clothing to cover up bruises or noticed that the person has suddenly become unusually quiet and withdrawn. Both can be signs of abuse.
 
Let the person know that you will be discreet about any information disclosed. Do not try to force the person to open up; let the conversation unfold at a comfortable pace.
 Take it slow and easy. Just let the person know that you are available and offering a sympathetic ear. 
If the person does decide to talk, listen to the story without being judgmental, offering advice, or suggesting solutions. Chances are if you actively listen, the person will tell you exactly what they need. Just give the person the full opportunity to talk.
 
You can ask clarifying questions, but mainly just let the person vent their feelings and fears. You may be the first person in which the victim has confided.
 
Many people try to cover up the abuse for a variety of reasons, and learning the warning signs of domestic abuse can help you help them:﻿﻿
 
Physical Signs:
 
Emotional Signs:
 
Behavioral Signs:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. 
Because domestic violence is more about control than anger, often the victim is the only one who sees the dark side of the perpetrator. Many times, others are shocked to learn that a person they know could commit violence.
 
Consequently, victims often feel that no one would believe them if they told people about the violence. Believe the victim's story and say so. For a victim, finally having someone who knows the truth about their struggles can bring a sense of hope and relief.
 
Offer the victim these assurances:
 
It's not unusual for victims to express conflicting feelings about their partner and their situation. These feelings can range from:
 
If you want to help, it is important that you validate her feelings by letting her know that having these conflicting thoughts is normal. But it is also important that you confirm that violence is not okay, and it isn't normal to live in fear of being physically attacked.
 
Some victims may not realize that their situation is abnormal because they have no other models for relationships and have gradually become accustomed to the cycle of violence. Tell the victim that violence and abuse aren't part of healthy relationships. Without judging, confirm to them that their situation is dangerous, and you are concerned for their safety.
 It can be hard to understand why someone you care about would seemingly choose to stay in an abusive or unhealthy relationship. Here are a few reasons why it's not easy to part ways.﻿﻿ 
Help the victim find support and resources. Look up telephone numbers for shelters, social services, attorneys, counselors, or support groups. If available, offer brochures or pamphlets about domestic violence.
 
You'll also want to help them get information on any laws regarding protective orders/restraining orders and child custody information. You can search state by state for legal information on WomensLaw.org.
 If the victim asks you to do something specific and you are willing to do it, don't hesitate to help. 
If you are unable to, try to find other ways the need can be met. Identify their strengths and assets, and help them build and expand upon them, so they find the ​motivation to help themselves.
 
The important thing is to let them know that you are there for them, available at any time. Just let them know the best way to reach you if help is needed. If possible, offer to go along for moral support to the police, court, or lawyer’s office.
 Let the person know they are not alone and help is available. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233 for immediate assistance and a referral to nearby counseling services or support groups. 
Help the victim create a safety plan that can be put into action if violence occurs again or if they decide to leave the situation. Just the exercise of making a plan can help them visualize which steps are needed and to prepare psychologically to do so.
 Because victims who leave their abusive partners are at a greater risk of being killed by their abuser than those who stay, it is extremely important for a victim to have a personalized safety plan before a crisis occurs or before they decide to leave.﻿﻿ 
Help the victim think through each step of the safety plan, weighing the risks and benefits of each option and ways to reduce the risks.
 
Be sure to include the following in the safety plan:
 How dangerous is the situation? Take the Danger Assessment Quiz to find out. 
Although there is no right or wrong way to help a victim of domestic violence, you want to avoid doing anything that will make the situation worse. Here are some ""don'ts"" the experts suggest you avoid:
 
Don't...
 
If you know that violence is actively occurring, call 9-1-1 immediately. If you hear or see physical abuse taking place, call the police. The police are the most effective way to remove the immediate danger to the victim and their children.
 
There are no situations in which children should be left in a violent situation. Do whatever is necessary to ensure their safety, even if it means going against the wishes of the victim or the wishes of the abuser.
 In actively violent situations, calling child protective services is not the problem, it's part of the solution. 
Although your natural impulse may be to ""rescue"" someone you care about from domestic violence, the person being abused needs to make the ultimate decision of whether (and when) to leave and get help. Keeping this in mind will help ensure that you support them no matter their decision and continue to provide them with a loving and safe friendship.

Child abuse and neglect have devastating effects on children that can last a lifetime. Abuse and neglect can increase the possibility of a child having a developmental delay and long-term emotional disabilities. These children also have an increased risk of involvement in drugs, sexually risky behavior, and behavioral disabilities. Child abuse may be physical, sexual or emotional.
 If you are a victim of child abuse or know someone who might be, call or text the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453 to speak with a professional crisis counselor. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Children who are experiencing abuse or neglect may show observable signs. They may be dropped off at school without appropriate clothing for the season, left without supervision too early at school or not picked up well after hours. They may have behavior problems such as acting out or getting multiple discipline referrals. They may also show more withdrawn and emotional behaviors such as crying easily, keeping to themselves or difficulty relating to peers and adults. They are also at risk for poor school performance.
 
Parents or other caregivers who abuse their children are often under a great deal of stress and may take out their stress on the children. They may feel as if there is no problem with their behavior toward the child. In such households, discipline tends to be severe, and physical punishment is the norm. Parents may be emotionally abusive, using harsh language, put-downs, and mocking behavior toward their children.
 
Child neglect involves denying a child what he needs for basic survival. Inadequate clothing, nutrition, educational and emotional support are examples. Meeting a child's physical needs such as adequate housing, medical care or basic supervision are often problems in neglectful households. Children who are neglected are often poorly prepared for school and may miss school a lot. These children may steal from others in an attempt to get the things they need. They may appear unwashed and unkempt. They may be sick repeatedly for long periods of time. In some cases, children who are not adequately supervised will become involved in drugs or alcohol, and the parents may be unaware of or not care.
 
Physical abuse occurs when an adult hurts a child causing injury. Physical injury may be caused by hitting, excessive spanking, cigarette burns (or other types of burns or scalds), shaking, kicking or other types of physical violence. Bruises, burns, and cuts in unusual places are possible signs of abuse. Bruises on knees and scraped elbows, however, are usually common injuries children get while playing. 
 When parents and children give differing explanations for the cause of an injury, abuse may be a factor. 
Emotional abuse leaves scars on children that cannot always be seen. Emotional abuse negatively affects a child's psychological and emotional development and may have long-term effects on cognitive development as well. Most emotional abuse is verbal. In these cases, parents or caregivers continually put the child down, blame him for problems that he could not possibly have caused, call him names or use similar forms of verbal abuse. Emotional abuse may also involve non-physical punishment designed to humiliate, shame or terrify the child.
 
Sexual abuse occurs when an adult has inappropriate sexual involvement with a child. It may involve sexual talking or texting or any physical contact such as intercourse, sodomy or touching. As with other forms of abuse, sexual abuse has devastating long-term effects on a child's psychological and physiological development.
 
School staff members are required by law to report incidents of suspected abuse of children. If you are concerned that a child may be the victim of abuse, it is important to contact the police to make a report. Reporting abuse is a critical first step in protecting the child and getting the family the help it needs to stop the cycle of abuse and neglect.

You may think that the way you treat or talk to your spouse is normal when in reality it is abusive. Sometimes, it is hard to tell if you are, as you may not have the level of insight necessary to figure this out. Or, you may think your behavior is ""normal"" because you grew up in a household of abusiveness, dysfunction, or negativity.
 
Abuse can occur verbally, mentally, and psychologically.﻿﻿ It is not just the physical version, also known as ""domestic violence."" Physical abuse may be more obvious, but the other forms of abuse are still very destructive to your marriage. It will undermine the trust, connection, and bond that must exist in your relationship for your marriage to succeed and be healthy. 
 If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential assistance from trained advocates. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you're wondering if you could be an abusive partner, ask yourself the following questions:
 
Has your partner complained to you about any of the following behaviors:
 
If you answered yes to several of these questions, please see a licensed professional counselor or clinical social worker for counseling. Be honest with the counselor or you will not get the help you need. Your spouse can join you in couples therapy, but only if you have your own counseling individually for a while before and concurrent with the marriage therapy. 
 
Look for an anger management group and read self-help books along with other treatments you are receiving.
 
If you abuse or use drugs or alcohol, you must stop or get help to stop. Drugs and alcohol are undoubtedly making your behavior worse. A 12-step program or similar is a must. 
 
In order to improve your behavior and your relationship, you need to have:
 
Saying 'I'm sorry' isn't enough. It's important that you take complete responsibility for your abusive behavior. Hold yourself accountable for any future abusive behavior—listen to your partner if they say you are acting in an abusive way and stop what you’re doing.
 
Do not be defensive or become angry, and if you find yourself getting angry, walk away and regroup. Realize this is your fault, not your partner's. If you want to hold onto your relationship, your partner deserves respect and abusive behavior is never acceptable or warranted.
 Did your partner already tell you that you are abusive? Is your spouse afraid of you? Have you ever threatened to kill your spouse? Do you believe that your way is the only way? Have you ever hit, slapped, pushed, pulled hair, or choked your spouse? Do you often feel jealous? Do you believe you have the right to know what your spouse is doing and where your spouse is all the time? Do you call or text your spouse incessantly when they are out without you? Do you think of yourself as in charge? Do you enjoy seeing your spouse in pain, crying, or hurt? Do you believe your spouse deserves to be hit or yelled at or punished? Do you believe your spouse 'asked for it'? Do you break or destroy your spouse's belongings on purpose? Have you ever been arrested for violent behavior? Do others tell you that you have an anger problem? Do others tell you that you seem paranoid? Are you afraid of asking for help because you might lose everything that is important to you? Has your spouse ever tried to leave you? Do you think about ""getting even"" with your spouse?  Do you twist things around, lie, or exaggerate to make your partner doubt themself and their sense of reality?

There are many natural ways to stay focused and sharp. From alternative therapies to herbal remedies, these natural approaches can help boost your productivity, protect your brain health as you age, and improve your overall wellbeing.
 
Getting your fill of certain types of foods may help you stay focused and sharp.
 
Flaxseed and oily fish like salmon and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids, a type of essential fatty acid that plays a key role in preserving brain health. A report published in Advances in Nutrition in 2013, for example, indicates that omega-3 fatty acids may help fight aging-related impairment in brain function. What's more, some research shows that omega-3 fatty acids may help improve attention.﻿﻿
 
In a study published in Neuropsychopharmacology in 2015, omega-3 supplementation was found to reduce symptoms of inattention in children.﻿﻿
 
Antioxidant nutrients may offer some protection against an aging-related decline in cognition (i.e., the set of mental abilities associated with processes like attention, memory, and problem-solving), according to a research review published in the European Journal of Nutrition in 2013.﻿﻿ Looking at 10 previously published studies, the review's authors found some evidence that antioxidant nutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin E may help slow the rate of cognitive decline.
 
A systematic review of 21 studies published in Phytomedicine in 2017 suggests that green tea consumption may enhance learning and memory and reduce anxiety.﻿﻿ One pilot study published in the journal Nutrients in 2014 also found that daily green tea intake helped improve cognitive function in a small group of older adults.﻿﻿
 
A number of herbal remedies show promise as a natural approach to staying focused and sharp. Here's a look at the science behind two of those remedies.
 
Sourced from the herb turmeric, curcumin has been found to reduce neuroinflammation, which is a key factor in the aging brain and cognitive decline. In addition, a 2018 study found that curcumin affects the brain's tau protein and exerts anti-amyloidogenic effects, which suggests it can be a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease.﻿﻿
 
Daily intake of the herb rosemary may boost cognitive performance and sharpen memory in older adults, according to a small study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food in 2012.﻿﻿ Rosmarinic acid, the active ingredient of rosemary stimulates NRF2 (internal antioxidant system of the cells) and reduces oxidative stress in the aging brain and therefore prevents aging and degeneration. There are evidence that it may reduce amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brain.﻿﻿
 
Lifestyle behaviors can also help you stay focused and sharp.
 
A great deal of research has shown that sleep deprivation can have a profoundly negative impact on cognitive function, including damaging effects on focus and memory.﻿﻿
 
A study published in Neurology in 2010 suggests that walking at least six miles per week may preserve memory in older adults. The study also found that regular exercise helped fight aging-related shrinkage in brain size.﻿﻿
 
Like skimping on sleep, letting your everyday stress go unchecked can greatly impair cognitive function.﻿﻿ To stay focused and sharp, it's crucial to take everyday steps to lower your stress levels.
 
Not only helpful in relieving stress, but the following mind-body techniques may also help you stay focused and sharp.
 
In a study of 40 undergraduate students (published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 2007), researchers observed that five days of 20-minute meditation training helped improve attention, as well as lower anxiety, fatigue, anger, and depression.﻿﻿
 
Published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2015, a review of nine previously published studies shows that taking up tai chi may help improve attention, memory, and other measures of cognitive ability in healthy adults.​﻿﻿

Coffee drinkers often wonder if caffeine can improve their memory. That's because many who religiously consume the beverage notice that they seem more alert when they've had coffee. One coffee drinker, who described himself as ""generally quite a forgetful person"" swore that his memory improved after a cup of joe.
 
But is there actually a link between the two, or is the connection just in the minds of coffee drinkers? Get the facts on the link between caffeine and memory with this review. 
 
Caffeine is a stimulant drug that affects the brain directly, and it has been shown without a doubt to increase alertness. However, the effects of caffeine on memory are more mixed.﻿﻿
 
Some studies have shown that caffeine can improve some types of memory, particularly the global aspects of memory. More in-depth research shows that the benefit of caffeine on memory is state-dependent. This means that caffeine only improves memory if it is used both at the time of taking the information in and at the time of recalling the information later.﻿﻿
 
If no caffeine is used at the time the information is presented, people perform more poorly if they take caffeine at the time they need to remember the information. On the other hand, if they've had caffeine when they take in the information, and they don't have caffeine when they try to remember it, they do worse than if they do have caffeine at the time they need to remember it.﻿﻿
 
Other studies show that with certain memory tasks, caffeine actually worsens performance. These include poorer performance on tasks of free recall–remembering information without being prompted. People also recall more false memories when they are under the influence of caffeine, so it can have the effect of stimulating your brain to come up with memories inaccurately.﻿﻿
 
There has been some encouraging research regarding the use of caffeine in older adults to counteract the natural declines in memory that are associated with age. For example, one study showed that caffeine reduced the afternoon decline in memory experienced by ""morning people""–older adults who generally perform better in the morning than in the afternoon.﻿﻿
 
However, other research indicates that caffeine is not a reliable way of improving memory in older people. In fact, research has shown that older people perform more poorly on tests of episodic memory after consuming caffeine-containing foods than those who do not. And although there is evidence that habitual caffeine use is associated with a modest advantage in long-term memory, this does not counter age-related memory declines.﻿﻿
 As caffeine is an addictive substance, trying to self-medicate what you believe to be a poor memory may actually be making matters worse. For example, caffeine tends to interfere with your sleep and is followed by a withdrawal period, both of which can cause memory problems. 
Talk to your doctor to find out whether you really have problems with your memory, other ways of improving your memory, and what an optimal amount of caffeine would be for you.

The brain uses more energy than any other organ in the human body and glucose is its primary source of fuel. But what happens when the brain is exposed to an excessive amount of sugars in the standard American diet? In this case, more is definitely not better.
 
In the brain, excess sugar impairs both our cognitive skills and our self-control. For many people, having a little sugar stimulates a craving for more. Sugar has drug-like effects in the reward center of the brain. Scientists have proposed that sweet foods—along with salty and fatty foods—can produce addiction-like effects in the human brain, driving the loss of self-control, overeating, and subsequent weight gain.
 
In early humans, this stimulus helped lead them to calorie-rich foods, which aided survival when food was scarce. But now this primitive drive contributes to our epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The behavioral and neurobiochemical characteristics of substance abuse and overeating are quite similar, and the idea of food addiction is gaining ground among scientists.
 
In humans, high-glycemic foods have been found to activate regions of the brain associated with the reward response and provoke more intense feelings of hunger compared to low-glycemic foods. Foods that cause a higher elevation in blood glucose produce a greater addictive drive in the brain.
 Research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition used the glycemic index (GI)—a measure of how certain foods convert to sugar in the body—to test this process and found eating a high-GI meal elicited greater brain activity in regions involved in eating behavior, reward, and craving.﻿﻿ 
Additional studies on brain activity have provided evidence supporting the idea that overeating alters our brain’s reward system, which then further drives overeating.﻿﻿ This same process is thought to underlie the tolerance associated with addiction.
 
Over time, greater amounts of the substance are required to reach the same level of reward. Studies imply that overeating results in a diminished reward response and a progressively worsening addiction to low-nutrient foods rich in sugar, salt, and fat.
 A study published PLoS One found that sweet foods can be more addictive than cocaine.﻿﻿ Though the research was performed on animals, investigators found that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward, even in drug-sensitized and -addicted individuals.  
Throughout the body, excess sugar is harmful. Even a single instance of elevated glucose in the bloodstream can be harmful to the brain, resulting in slowed cognitive function and deficits in memory and attention.
 
Some research suggests high sugar consumption causes inflammation in the brain, leading to memory difficulties. A 2016 study published in Behavioral Brain Research found inflammatory markers were present in the hippocampus of rats fed a high sugar diet, but not in those fed a standard diet.﻿﻿
 
The good news, however, is this inflammatory damage from sugar may not be permanent.
 A 2017 study in the journal Appetite found that the memory damage caused by sugar consumption can be reversed by following a low-sugar, low-GI diet.﻿﻿ 
In addition, research published in the journal Nutrients in 2015 found reducing sugar consumption and supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin improves working memory.﻿﻿
 
Sugar also affects mood. In healthy young people, the ability to process emotion is compromised with elevated blood glucose, according to a brain imaging study.
 
Another study published in Diabetes Care found that people with type 2 diabetes reported increased feelings of sadness and anxiety during acute hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar).﻿﻿
 
One of the largest studies to link sugar with depression—an analysis of dietary consumption and mood of 23,245 individuals enrolled in the Whitehall II study—found higher rates of sugar consumption was associated with a greater incidence of depression.﻿﻿
 The study, published in 2017 in the journal Scientific Reports, found those with the highest level of sugar consumption were a 23% more likely to be diagnosed with a mental disorder than those with the lowest sugar intakes. 
Elevated blood glucose harms blood vessels. Blood vessel damage is the major cause of the vascular complications of diabetes, leading to other problems, such as damage to blood vessels in the brain and eyes causing retinopathy.
 
Studies of long-term diabetics show progressive brain damage leading to deficits in learning, memory, motor speed, and other cognitive functions.﻿﻿ Frequent exposure to high glucose levels diminishes mental capacity, as higher HbA1c levels have been associated with a greater degree of brain shrinkage.
 Even in those without diabetes, higher sugar consumption is associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive function. These effects are thought to be due to a combination of hyperglycemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and elevated cholesterol. 
Additional research shows that a diet high in added sugar reduces the production brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a brain chemical essential for new memory formation and learning.﻿﻿ Lower levels of BDNF are also linked to dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to a study published in the journal Diabetologia.﻿﻿
 
As the research shows, any sugar added in our food is dangerous. We can avoid these dangers by satisfying our sweet tooth with fresh fruit in place of refined sugars.
 
Eating fresh fruit provides the satisfying sweetness of sugar-laden treats with the added bonus of the fruit’s fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that curtail the surge of sugar in the bloodstream and block its negative effects.

What if there was a way to get more out of each day? While we all have the same 24 hours, how we use that time impacts what we can accomplish. Recent research suggests that one way to pack more into your day is to sync your biological clock to your daily schedule. By doing certain things at peak periods of activity and energy, you might be able to improve your productivity.
 
Your biological clock controls a great deal of how you function. This works much like a program, regulating the timing of many biological functions ranging from when you sleep to when you reproduce. Circadian rhythms manage daily cycles of sleeping and waking and contribute to your energy levels at various points during the day.
 
You might become particularly aware of your body's biological clock at times when your daily schedule is thrown off-kilter. Shift workers, for example, must constantly adjust their daily ebb and flow to the demands of their work schedule. Travelers may experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycles leading to feelings of jet lag.
 
You've probably noticed that there are certain times during the day when you feel more energized. At other times, you might feel drained. Research has shown, however, that your body clock is responsible for far more than just your sleep-wake cycle.
 Mental alertness, hunger, stress, mood, heart function, and even immunity are also influenced by the body's daily rhythms. By synchronizing your biological clock with your daily schedule, you can make the most of your day and feel more accomplished and motivated. 
Circadian rhythms affect your sleep-wake cycle, eating habits, body temperature, digestion, hormone levels, and other body functions. Because of this, your body's internal clock can play an important role in your overall health. Interruptions to your circadian rhythm may contribute to health conditions including diabetes, seasonal affective disorder, and sleep disorders.﻿﻿
 
Fortunately, understanding how these cycles influence your health can help you address potential problems and seek treatments that can help. For example, you can make lifestyle changes that can help get your circadian rhythm back on track. Your doctor can also help you address conditions that might be affected by your body's natural rhythms and come up with treatments that involve both medication and lifestyle adjustments. 
 
The reality is that the demands of daily life such as school, commuting, work, and social events can all throw the body's natural cycles out of whack. The way we organize our daily activities is sometimes in direct contrast to our body's own inclinations.
 
Altering your schedule might not always be easy, but there are clear benefits to doing so. In addition to making better use of your time, there are also potential health implications. Circadian rhythm disruptions have been linked to a range of negative health outcomes including depression and diabetes.﻿﻿
 
When is the best time to tackle certain tasks?
 
Your biological clock plays a major role in controlling your daily sleeping and waking cycle. Factors such as your schedule, bedtime routines, and even age can play a role as well.
 
The body's natural sleep cycle changes as we age. Knowing this might help you adapt your own schedule to best suit your sleep needs.
 Energy levels tend to dip in the early afternoon. This can be a great time to take a nap. Even if you are not able to take a quick power nap, a quick break from your work might be beneficial and improve task performance.﻿﻿ 
Could eating at the right time really be better for your health? Studies suggest that eating at certain times may have some health benefits.
 
Restricting your eating to a 12 to 15-hour window during the day can be helpful. Eating before bed can also have a negative impact on sleep, so its best to avoid eating late in the evening. At the very least, try timing your last meal so that it a minimum of three hours before you go to bed.
 
Adjusting your exercise schedule to match your biological clock may also help you get the most out of your workouts.
 Research suggests that regular exercise can help regulate your circadian rhythm and help improve your daily sleep schedule.﻿﻿ 
The evening might be the best time for yoga and other exercises that require flexibility. This is because this is when the body is at its most relaxed and least prone to injury.
 
You may also want to adjust your schedule to make of most of your mental powers.
 
If you are working on some sort of creative task, you might want to wait until you are feeling a bit fatigued. In a study examining how the time of day influences problem solving, researchers had participants solve analytical problems during times when they were either at their mental peak or at non-optimal times of tiredness.﻿﻿
 The researchers found that people tend to do their best creative thinking when they are tired. Because the mind is more inclined to wander when we are tired, it seems that it can lead people to think in more novel and innovative ways. 
Of course, not everyone's biological clock functions the same way. Some people tend to experience energy peaks earlier in the day, while others are more active during the later hours. Thanks to the demands of daily life, it may sometimes feel like your biological clock and schedule are at odds.
 
So what can you do if your daily schedule is out of sync with your biological clock? Early risers, for example, may burn up their best energy in the early morning hours and feel burned out by the time evening rolls around. Night owls, on the other hand, might sleep through what might be the most productive times of the day and find themselves staying up at times when they tend to be low energy.
 Here are some tips for establishing a more productive daily schedule: 
Paying attention to how your energy levels shift throughout the day can give you a better idea of when you might be at your best. If you tend to feel more mentally alert in the mornings, try to schedule cognitively demanding activities during that time. Changing your daily schedule to better match your daily rhythms can take some time, but it can ultimately lead to greater productivity and improved motivation.
 Young children tend to be early risers, where teens are more inclined to sleep in. As people approach later adulthood, the sleep cycle continues to shift back toward rising earlier in the morning. Teens might be better served getting longer periods of rest before tackling their day, where older adults might prefer to get up earlier and go to bed earlier. Eating at the right time might help control your weight. According to one study, when certain mice had their food restricted to particular times, they were protected from excessive weight gain and metabolic diseases.﻿﻿ Surprisingly, research has found that when you eat can even play a role in resetting your biological clock. This research also suggests that if you are trying to adjust to a new schedule (such as if you are traveling or doing shift work), altering your eating schedule can also help you reset your body clock to better match your new daily schedule.﻿﻿ You might get the most out of workouts that take place in mid- to late afternoon. People tend to perform their best and are the least prone to injury between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Try strength-training later in the day. Physical strength also tends to be at its highest point between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. You are probably at your sharpest in the morning. Studies suggest that cognitive abilities tend to peak during the late morning hours you might want to tackle those mentally taxing activities before lunch.﻿﻿ Experts also suggest that alertness and attention levels taper off following meals. This is why you might find yourself struggling to concentrate on those post-lunch work meetings. Concentration levels tend to dip between noon and 4 p.m., which might explain why so many people feel like they need some type of energy-boosting pick-me-up during those hours. Establish a sleep schedule: Set an alarm and go to bed at the same time each night. Wake up when your alarm goes off—no hitting that snooze button over and over again. Give it some time: Getting used to a new schedule may take a while, but stick with it until it starts to feel more natural. Pay attention to your energy levels: Try to arrange certain activities around your peak energy levels. Not everyone is the same, so your own energy levels may follow a slightly different schedule.",way get day hours use time impact accomplish recent research suggest one way pack day sync biological

Sexual harassment is not just embarrassing and uncomfortable for victims, it can be devastating for them too. In fact, sexual harassment can cause a victim to experience everything from depression﻿﻿ and anxiety to shame, guilt, and self-blame. If you have experienced sexual harassment at work, there are a number of things you can do to heal from the experience. But it is going to take some work.
 
One of the first steps in overcoming sexual harassment is to acknowledge what happened to you and recognize that it was wrong. In fact, sexual harassment is such a serious issue that it is regulated by the law. For instance, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) says that it is against the law to harass a person because of that person’s sex.
 It also is against the law to make unwelcome sexual advances, request sexual favors, touch someone inappropriately, make sexual remarks, engage in sexual bullying, and share sexually-offensive jokes. Basically, anything sexual in nature that creates a hostile work environment is considered sexual harassment. 
What’s more, sexual harassment is not limited to male-to-female abuse even though it is by far the most common form of harassment. Female-to-female sexual harassment, male-to-male sexual harassment, and female-to-male sexual harassment also take place and are against the law.
 
While the law does not usually apply to isolated incidents of teasing or offhand remarks, it becomes harassment when it creates a toxic work environment or when it results in adverse employment conditions such as being fired or reprimanded due to sexual harassment.
 
While every person deals with the trauma of sexual harassment differently, if you have been victimized by sexual harassment, you may start off feeling shocked and then move to denial.﻿﻿ These responses are normal and are usually followed by feelings of victimization, which can lead to low self-esteem.
 
Additionally, your response can be so significant that you may even have trouble functioning from day to day. The key is to address the issue or leave the work environment.
 
It also is not uncommon for victims of sexual harassment to have difficulty sleeping,﻿﻿ getting up in the morning, eating, exercising, or doing anything that they used to consider fun. Other symptoms that sexual harassment can lead to might include headaches, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, stomach issues, and elevated blood pressure.
 
You might also feel betrayed, angry, powerless, hopeless, and out of control. And in extreme cases, victims may experience depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Moving on after being sexually harassed at work can seem like a daunting task. You may feel stuck or hopeless about your situation. But with a little work and some outside counseling, you should be able to make sense of your experience, heal from it, and move on. Here are some steps every victim must take in order to heal from sexual harassment.
 
If you have a friend or family member who is dealing with the aftermath of sexual harassment, you may want to help, but just don't know where to start. Simply being there to listen and be supportive is often all that is required.
 
You do not need to fix things for your friend, nor do you need to offer sage advice. Your most important role is to be patient with what she is going through and support her where you can.﻿﻿ She needs to know that she is safe with you and that you believe her. You also could remind her that the harassment was not her fault. Here is a list of additional tips for when you are interacting with your friend:
 
Remember not to judge her. Try to understand her feelings and offer support. Be there for her when you can and encourage her to talk to others as well.
 
Encourage her to stay connected. The worst thing your friend can do is become isolated or spend a lot of time alone. While it is common for any victim of harassment to withdraw from others, this is not helpful to her healing. Nudge her to stay connected to you and other people.
 
Respect her boundaries, and give her space if she needs it. Remember, her boundaries were violated when she was sexually harassed so she will likely fight pretty hard to develop new ones. Allow her the freedom to do that. Do not smother her with attention or help.
 
Allow her to heal at her own pace. Do not rush her or try to fix things for her. Everyone heals at different rates. Try to be patient if she is taking longer to get over her experience than you think she should.
 
Support her decisions even if you do not agree with them. It is very important that your friend makes her own decisions. She needs the space and the control takes back her life on her terms. While it is fine to make suggestions, do not try to control her or tell her what to do.
 
Dealing with the trauma of sexual harassment is something that should not be put off or ignored. It is important that you explore your underlying feelings and find healthy ways of dealing with these emotions. Too many times people try to numb their feelings with other things like busy work or food.
 
Some will even resort to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain and forget for a period of time. But these are not healthy ways of coping. If you find that you cannot develop good coping skills on your own, be sure to ask your doctor for recommendations for a reputable counselor. Remember, it is not a sign of weakness to get counseling. In fact, it is a sign of wisdom and courage.
 Accept what happened. What this means is to validate your experience. Do not minimize what happened or make excuses for the perpetrator. It is also important to allow yourself to experience your emotions. Do not bottle up the hurt and anger you are feeling. Find healthy ways to express these feelings. Some options include prayer, meditation, yoga,﻿﻿ and other stress-reducing activities. Talk to someone about the harassment. It always helps to talk with a safe person. Try to find someone who will respect your feelings and your perspective. Don't share your thoughts and feelings with someone who is going to tell you that you are overreacting or being emotional. If you do not have anyone to talk with about your experience, consider joining a support group or starting one of your own. Journal about your experience. Describe how sexual harassment affected you. Explore the different emotions you are feeling. Sometimes it is helpful to include in your journal a letter to the person who harassed you. Say all the things you wish you would have said, but didn't. It can be very healing to get all of that out of your system. Journaling also may help you make sense of what happened to you.﻿﻿ And it is a safe place to say whatever is on your mind without trying to filter anything out. Stop blaming yourself. What happened to you was not your fault. You did not cause it and you could not control the other person. Remind yourself too that you have nothing to be ashamed of and you should not feel guilty. Blaming yourself will slow your healing. The only guilty person is the perpetrator. He made a choice to sexually harass you. The only choice you have in the matter is how you are going to deal with what happened to you. Remember, you have complete control over your response and where you go from here. Focus on that fact and let it empower you. Bring closure to your experience. An important part of the healing process is putting the past behind you and detaching from the trauma you experienced. Sometimes this means changing jobs or careers. It also could mean discovering who you really are. Too many times, a person's identity is tied to her work. Instead, rediscover what makes you you. Start a new hobby and develop new interests. And most importantly, do not dwell on what happened to you. Find a healthy way to put the past behind you and try to remain positive about things in your life. Use the experience to help others. Sometimes, you can bring meaning to what happened to you by integrating your experience into your life in some way. For instance, you could write a blog about what you have experienced and offer suggestions to readers. Or, you could lead a support group, build a website for harassment victims, or speak to others. Another option is to volunteer with non-profit groups that address sexual harassment. The key is taking a negative experience and turning it into something positive. Doing so helps build your resiliency. Find a counselor. If you find it difficult to move on after your experience, you may benefit from seeing a counselor who specializes in dealing with workplace sexual harassment. Counselors that specialize in sexual assault or abuse may also be helpful. Additionally, if you have been harassed at work or school, advocates advise not using your school or employer's mental health staff. Sometimes the lines of confidentiality get blurred and the counselor will share your information about you to others in the organization. In extreme cases, they may even try to protect the organization from liability. It is always best to find a counselor outside of where the sexual harassment occurred. Not only is it an added protection for your privacy, but you may find it easier to open up to someone that is not associated with the organization where the harassment occurred.",sexual harassment

Imagine what the world would be like if everyone was in agreement. It would be pretty peaceful, right? While at first agreeing on everything might seem like the ideal solution to today’s firestorm of difficulties, it also could get pretty boring. The world needs diversity, different opinions, and different people. In fact, it is a good thing when people have their own thoughts, opinions, and values. This fact can lead to new ideas, fresh perspectives, and productive discussions.
 
Differences of opinion only become an issue when people are unable to respect another person’s beliefs and values. For some people, it’s all too easy to get so wrapped up in their own beliefs that common courtesy and respect are ditched at the first hint of disagreement. And in some cases, the result can become so harsh and cruel that the discussions no longer qualify as disagreements. Instead, they morph into bullying complete with name-calling, emotional abuse, threats and sometimes even physical violence.
 
Most of the time when people are bullied for their beliefs, opinions, thoughts or values, this falls into prejudice-based bullying. Aside from being intolerant of another person’s opinions and beliefs, these bullies also might attack someone for her religious beliefs and political opinions. Typically, prejudice-based bullying is motivated by fear and a lack of understanding. As a result, if you want to fight this type of bullying you need to alleviate those fears and help foster understanding. Most of the time, this begins with education.
 Once people understand why the differences exist, they are more likely to be respectful and tolerant in response. 
If you are being targeted for your beliefs, whether they are simple opinions, political views or in a support of a particular cause like animal rights, abuse prevention or climate control, there are ways to deal with this type of bullying in a calm and effective manner. Here are some things you can do to cope with being bullied for your beliefs and values.
 
Bullying is always wrong and never acceptable. However, when you are dealing with someone who is bullying you for your beliefs, it helps to know what is motivating them. Having some understanding of the bully helps to take the focus off what he is saying to you and instead puts the focus back on him.
 
Are they bullying you because they are afraid you expect them to be exactly like you? Do they engage in bullying because they do not understand the cause you are supporting and need more information? Or, are they bullying you simply because they lack empathy and enjoy trolling or flaming you? Once you can grasp the motivation behind the bullying, you will know how to deal with it. For instance, you can provide more information to someone who lacks understanding about your beliefs but if the person is a troll, it is best to ignore or report them.
 
While it would be wonderful if everyone supported the same causes, this simply is not feasible. If the person bullying you is a co-worker, family member or someone you regularly interact with, it might be helpful to remind him that just because you support a particular cause does not mean you expect them to follow. People are less likely to get defensive or mean if they do not feel pressured, judged, or threatened in some way. Be sure that you are just as respectful of their opinions and beliefs as you want them to be.
 
While you cannot expect everyone to change or conform to your way of thinking, you also should not conform or hide who you are because they do not agree. Expecting others to be respectful is not asking too much. Healthy friends, family members, and co-workers should accept your values and beliefs even if they disagree. They should never make fun of you or what you think, ever. If they are unable to be respectful, be sure you stand up to their bullying. You also can reduce or eliminate your interactions with them if they are unable to treat you well. There is no room in your life for toxic people or fake friends.
 
Be proud of who you are and do not let anyone attempt to define you with their insults and bullying. What you believe in is not stupid or pointless. You have a right to your opinions, values, and beliefs just like anyone else. Remember, there will always be someone who disagrees with you. There are many people out there who enjoy debating, arguing, and sometimes even bullying. But that does not mean that your beliefs are invalid. Unless your beliefs are harmful to others, you are not doing anything wrong.
 
Unfortunately, there are times when disagreements go too far. If you are in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or if you feel unsafe or threatened in some way, it is important to either report the bullying or gets others involved who can help you or protect you. Do not be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes bullies can be so determined to gain control over you or force you to change that they will go too far to make it happen. Never put yourself in danger to support your cause. Make your personal safety a top priority.
 
Having the extra support of being in a group that shares your values and your goals can be invaluable. The extra support and validation you feel from being around others who agree with you can offset the negative impact of bullying. Join or start a club, participate in meet-ups, find online forums, or follow others with similar views on social media. The support, friendships, and discussions will not only have a positive impact but also will build your self-esteem and confidence.

Anyone who has been a target of workplace bullying knows the pain that this type of harassment and humiliation causes. But once the bully has been dealt with, don't expect to feel fine afterward. While you may experience a sense of relief that you are no longer experiencing the daily stress of working with a bully, you also may have some residual effects from what you experienced. In fact, workplace bullying often has a lasting impact on your overall mental and physical health.
 
As a result, there will be days when the road to recovery may be challenging. Something someone says may trigger those familiar feelings of anxiety.﻿﻿ Or, you may worry every time you disagree with someone. These feelings are all normal. But with a little work and an extra effort in taking care of yourself, you will get your life back. What's more, you can take what happened to you in the workplace and learn from it. Use it to strengthen you as you move forward with your life and your career.
 
The key is to not allow what happened to you define who you are as a person. Recognize that workplace bullies have a choice. You did not deserve to be bullied. Place the responsibility for the bullying on the shoulders of the bully and move on. Leave the hurtful words and the actions in the past.
 
Here are the top five things you can do to recover from workplace bullying.
 
Targets of workplace bullying deal with a host of health issues including sleeplessness, stomach issues, headaches, and stress conditions. They also may deal with post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, eating disorders, depression, and thoughts of suicide.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Talk to your doctor about any symptoms you are experiencing. It’s also a good idea to find a counselor.
 
Remember, being targeted by a workplace bully does more than impact your mood or self-esteem. It also can impact your physical health. Do not delay in taking care of yourself. Ignoring your symptoms can lead to a host of other health issues. Getting healthy should be your top priority.
 
When bullying takes place, the target is often accused of having a problem or being the problem. Constant criticism, rumors, lies, and gossip can take its toll leaving you feeling lonely, isolated, and hopeless. But remember you are not alone.
 
In fact, workplace bullying is a widespread issue that affects workers every day. Research suggests that an estimated 11% of workers are bullied in the workplace.﻿﻿
 
Consider finding a support group in your area or starting one of your own. Find validation for what you have experienced and recognize that there is nothing wrong with you. It will take work to build up your self-esteem and overall confidence again, but it can be done.
 
If you are confused by what has happened to you, read everything you can about workplace bullying. While it can be painful to read about the issue, in the long run, it will help you come to terms with what happened to you. What’s more, being educated about bullying will prepare you for future confrontations. Some targets of workplace bullying even become advocates or support group leaders for others suffering at the hands of a workplace bully.
 
Many times, people who have been bullied develop a very narrow view of life because the bullying they experienced consumes their every thought. Think about things other than what you have gone through, things that have meaning or purpose in your life.
 
There are numerous benefits to positive thinking.﻿﻿ If you are having trouble doing this on your own, a counselor can help you redirect your thought processes. What’s more, do your best to avoid feeling guilty about how you confronted the bully or the length of time it took you to take action. These things are in the past. Leave them there.
 
Part of the healing process is being able to put the past behind you and detach from the trauma you experienced. Sometimes finding this closure involves changing jobs or careers. But you also need to discover that your identity is tied to more than just your work. Rediscover who you are. Develop new interests, new hobbies, new goals, and new dreams.
 
Don't allow yourself to be preoccupied with what happened to you. Instead, find a healthy way to shift your focus and put the past behind you.
 
Remember, what happened to you was not fair, but it does not have to define who you are. Let go of any urge to engage in victim thinking. Yes, you were victimized, but you are more than what happened to you. Take the time to rediscover who you truly are not who the bully claimed you were. You also should avoid blaming yourself for being bullied. It was not your fault. It was the bully's choice. And most importantly take care of yourself. By paying attention to what you need to feel healthy, you will be well on your way to healing from workplace bullying.

When former Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal came up with the concept of “period proof underwear,” the company was applauded for its commitment to empowering women and de-stigmatizing menstruation. So when Agrawal, a self-described feminist who claimed she created an open and safe working environment, was accused of sexually harassing her predominately female staff, people were shocked.
 
Here was a company touted as a trailblazing feminist organization with a former CEO accused of female-to-female sexual harassment. How could that be?
 
When most people think about sexual harassment in the workplace, they envision a man harassing a woman. But there are cases where women harass women, men harass men, and women harass men. In fact, the law prohibits sexual harassment by either men or women against people of the same and opposite gender.﻿﻿
 Sexual harassment falls under Title VII, which is a law against sexual discrimination in the workplace. It occurs when someone engages in unwelcome sexual conduct in the workplace that affects you, your job, the work environment, as well as others in the workplace. Under the law, there are two types of sexual harassment claims: 
With quid pro quo claims, a supervisor or someone with authority over an employee requests or implies an unwelcome sexual demand in exchange for something on the job, such as getting a promotion or not being fired. Meanwhile, a hostile environment occurs when the environment at work becomes intimidating or offensive because of sexual actions and comments. Examples might include sexual jokes and comments, sexual bullying, lewd remarks, demeaning pictures, and unwanted sexting. 
 
In the Thinx case, Agrawal allegedly had an obsession with one employee’s breasts, touching them without permission and asking her to expose them.﻿﻿ She was also accused of holding routine video conference meetings while naked in bed and frequently changing clothes in front of employees. 
 
What’s more, there are reports that she conducted at least one FaceTime meeting while sitting on a toilet and regularly discussed her sexual exploits, including polyamory. Other reports indicate she expressed an interest in having a sexual relationship with at least one of her female employees.﻿﻿
 
Most researchers suggest that the actual number of people who have experienced same-sex sexual harassment is likely higher than what is currently being reported.﻿﻿ In fact, it is extremely difficult to measure how frequently it occurs in the workplace because people often never file a complaint. 
 
Aside from the fact that it is difficult to report and prove, victims of sexual harassment often worry that they are somehow to blame for the unwelcome sexual advances.﻿﻿ What's more, they worry about what others will think of them if they do file a report, especially when the harasser is the same gender. They are often riddled with embarrassment and shame over what is happening to them.
 
Another reason for failing to report sexual harassment includes fear of retaliation. Research has found that sexual harassment is often ignored or trivialized by management within organizations.﻿﻿ Additionally, when victims do say something about the treatment or ask that it stop, they are often met with hostility and accusations.
 Experts expect to see a rise in the number of same-sex sexual harassment complaints as employees become more empowered. In general, people are more willing to stand up to others and point out that their civil rights have been violated. 
Too often, when someone is sexually harassed at work, people start to question the role the victim played in the abuse. But psychologists caution against this victim-blaming viewpoint.﻿﻿ Most would argue that regardless of the perpetrator's gender and sexual orientation, sexual harassment is driven by anger and insecurity as much as it is by attraction. 
 
In fact, most people who sexually harass others, regardless of whether they are men or women, are looking to control and dominate others. The harasser feels more in control when she has power over someone else. What's more, some harassers are looking to embarrass and humiliate their targets rather than sexually stimulate or flirt with them.
 
Sexual harassment is more about using a position of power to control and hurt someone else. Meanwhile, others say that in the workplace sexual harassment is a form of manipulation.﻿﻿ It's a way to inadvertently devalue someone's work by calling attention to their sexuality instead.
 
According to a 2015 survey, one out of three women between the ages of 18 and 34 experiences sexual harassment at work.﻿﻿ Of those women, 81% of them have experienced verbal harassment, 44% have received sexual advances and unwanted touching, and 25% have dealt with lewd texts or emails. Meanwhile, 75% of women were harassed by male coworkers and 10% by female coworkers. 
 
Yet, very few women are reporting the abuse. In fact, 71% of women say that they never reported the sexual harassment they endured at work. And of the 29% who did report the harassment, only 15% felt it was handled properly. 
 
For those who work to educate others about sexual harassment prevention, these figures are particularly disappointing—especially considering that the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 70% of employers provide sexual harassment training and 98% of companies have sexual harassment policies.﻿﻿ 
 If you have been a victim of sexual harassment at work, let someone in management or human resources know what you are experiencing. And if they do not take you seriously, contact the EEOC or an attorney for suggestions on what to do next.  Quid pro quo claims Hostile environment claims",former thinx ceo miki agrawal come concept period proof underwear company applaud commitment empower women stigmatize menstruation agrawal self describe feminist claim create open safe work environment accuse sexually harass predominately female staff people shock company tout trailblazing feminist organization former ceo accuse female female sexual harassment could people think sexual harassment workplace envision man harass woman case women harass women men harass men women harass men fact law prohibit sexual harassment either men women people opposite gender sexual harassment fall title vii law sexual discrimination workplace occur someone engage unwelcome sexual conduct workplace affect job work environment well others workplace law two type sexual harassment claim quid pro quo claim supervisor someone authority employee request imply unwelcome sexual demand exchange something job get promotion fire meanwhile hostile environment occur environment work become intimidate offensive sexual action comment examples might include sexual joke comment sexual bully lewd remark demean picture unwanted sexting thinx case agrawal allegedly obsession one employee breast touch without permission ask expose also accuse hold routine video conference meet naked bed frequently change clothe front employees report conduct least one facetime meet sit toilet regularly discuss sexual exploit include polyamory report indicate express interest sexual relationship least one female employees researchers suggest actual number people experience sex sexual harassment likely higher currently report fact extremely difficult measure frequently occur workplace people often never file complaint aside fact difficult report prove victims sexual harassment often worry somehow blame unwelcome sexual advance worry others think file report especially harasser gender often riddle embarrassment shame happen another reason fail report sexual harassment include fear retaliation research find sexual harassment often ignore trivialize management within organizations additionally victims say something treatment ask stop often meet hostility accusations experts expect see rise number sex sexual harassment complaints employees become empower general people will stand others point civil right violate often someone sexually harass work people start question role victim play abuse psychologists caution victim blame viewpoint would argue regardless perpetrator gender sexual orientation sexual harassment drive anger insecurity much attraction fact people sexually harass others regardless whether men women look control dominate others harasser feel control power someone else harassers look embarrass humiliate target rather sexually stimulate flirt sexual harassment use position power control hurt someone else meanwhile others say workplace sexual harassment form manipulation way inadvertently devalue someone work call attention sexuality instead accord survey one three women age experience sexual harassment work women experience verbal harassment receive sexual advance unwanted touch deal lewd texts email meanwhile women harass male coworkers female coworkers yet women report abuse fact women say never report sexual harassment endure work report harassment felt handle properly work educate others sexual harassment prevention figure particularly disappoint especially consider bureau labor statistics report employers provide sexual harassment train company sexual harassment policies victim sexual harassment work let someone management human resources know experience take seriously contact eeoc attorney suggestions next quid pro quo claim hostile environment claim

Every company wants its employees to get along. After all, teamwork is an essential part of a company's success. But sometimes groups of employees form cliques at work. When this happens, it is detrimental to employee morale and can lead to workplace bullying. Cliques cause employees on the outside to feel like they are less important or worthy than those on the inside. And, that’s just bad for business. Here are the top seven reasons why workplace cliques are bad for your company.
 
Excessive togetherness is bad for companies because those on the outside become distracted and dissatisfied with the work environment. They may even expend more energy trying to cope with the clique than they do on their actual job. What’s more, cliques can become more about the group than they are about the company. In the end, this impacts the company’s bottom line. And it causes good employees to flee the company when they have had enough.
 
It is important to address issues with cliques as soon as they occur. When you see something inappropriate, be sure to address it right away. But try not to overreact. While it is important that there be unity among all workers, you want to be careful not to punish employees for having close friends at work. Be sure you know the difference between a clique and a group of friends before you step in and break them up.
 
One way to prevent employees from ostracizing others is to assign them to group projects instead of allowing them to choose their own groups. When you allow employees to pick their own groups, you are opening the door to workplace bullying. Conversely, when you select the group, you are ensuring that they include those outside their circle of friends. Pre-selected groups also give employees the opportunity to learn how to work with different types of people.
 
Another way that workplace cliques can affect employee morale is by making a big deal out of the things they do together. For instance, cliques often laugh and share inside jokes that other employees do not get. These secrets create an unbalanced workforce because some employees are left feeling like outsiders instead of part of the team.
 
Remember, not all bullies are the same. Some bullies are very covert and manipulative. As a result, this type of bullying is hard to recognize. Be sure you know what constitutes workplace bullying. This will help you identify workplace bullying issues within your company and help you eliminate cliques.
 
Nothing disrupts the work environment more than office rumor mill. As a result, be sure your employees can identify the perils of gossip and rumor-spreading in the workplace. You also should educate your employees on what constitutes workplace bullying and how they should respond when they witness bullying in the workplace. 
 
Stress to your employees the importance of thinking before posting something online. The group mentality of a clique often leads employees to take embarrassing photos and videos of other employees and post them on social media. And photos and videos are not limited to those outside the group. They may even expose members of the clique on social media. Sometimes their actions even border on workplace cyberbullying.
 
Be sure you are clear about your company’s policies regarding social media use. It’s also a good idea to discuss the key components of digital etiquette with your employees. Also, a discussion about what they should avoid posting online is always helpful. Employees need to realize that these guidelines apply both in the office and outside of work.
 
Being alike can make employees feel safe. But it also hinders productivity. People feel discouraged to think outside the box or suggest new ideas because they don’t want to rock the boat or be different. Stress to your employees that you are looking for fresh and new ideas and that you don’t want cookie-cutter approaches to problems. Try to get them to see that you don’t want them to be like everyone else at work. Be sure they know that you value creativity and authenticity from your employees. When you do that, you will discourage the like-mindedness that holds cliques together.

Interacting with a passive-aggressive person is complicated. Most of the time, their actions are complex, confusing, and used as a way of coping with stress, anxieties, and insecurities. Passive aggressive people often deny that they are hurt, angry, or offended. Yet, they will lash out at you in subtle and puzzling ways.
 
For instance, they may give people the silent treatment, ostracize people from the group, use passive violence like slamming books or doors, or engage in subtle forms of relational aggression. But the person on the receiving end has no idea why this behavior is happening. After all, the passive-aggressive person denied they were even angry.
 
Many times, passive-aggressive people are sarcastic, even when sarcasm is an inappropriate response. And when confronted about their mean behavior, they will pass it off as a joke often accusing the victim of being too sensitive. 
 These bullies also tend to seek people who will not address their actions or hold them accountable. 
Consequently, they prey on people who are afraid of conflict or who engage in people-pleasing. By doing so, they don't have to be honest about their feelings or take responsibility for their actions, but they can still express their hostilities without ever having a real fight.
 
It's not always easy to spot this type of bully. Some passive aggressive bullies sabotage others quietly when no one is watching and then act innocent when confronted.
 
Others will be sullen and argumentative. The irony is that beneath this bully's exterior lies low self-esteem, feelings of insecurity and inadequacy and an inability to express anger in a healthy way.
 Passive aggressive bullies may not realize they are angry or feeling resentful because their feelings are repressed. Consequently, they often complain that they are misunderstood and victimized. 
They also believe others are holding them to unreasonable standards when they are confronted. Here are some behaviors that will help you identify passive aggressive people.
 
The passive-aggressive people rarely says what they are really thinking, which can be confusing for people on the receiving end. For instance, when a passive aggressive mean girl is confronted about acting mean, she will feign innocence or deny that she was cruel even though her actions say something completely different.
 
Passive-aggressive people rarely take responsibility for their actions. If they don't blame you for what happened, then they will blame their teacher, their boss, and even the weather.
 
Passive aggressive people cannot accept that they are at fault. If something happens, it has to be someone else’s fault. As a result, they engage in minimization and victim-blaming on a regular basis.
 
Passive-aggressive people hide their resentment about being asked to do something by being accommodating. As a result, they may agree to do something but really are angry about having been asked to do.
 
To relieve some of their resentment, they may give the person making the request the silent treatment. Or, they may talk about the person and even spread rumors or gossip. Other times, they may simply never follow through with what was requested.
 
Passive-aggressive people rarely show anger. Instead, they stuff it down inside. They may even appear happy and accommodating on the outside most of the time.
 But beware. They will act on their pent up anger by sticking it to someone in an under-handed way. 
By doing so, they are letting out some of their anger without ever admitting that they are upset. The passive-aggressive person often feels treated unfairly. They also feel taken advantage of and resentful.
 
As a result, it is not uncommon for passive aggressive bullies to engage in victim-thinking. If someone gets upset because of something they did, then in their mind that person is bullying them. They never seen themselves as a bully.
 
Passive-aggressive people tend to lack boundaries and gravitate toward others without boundaries. As a result, they often make those who are conflict-averse the focal point of their hostilities by creating drama.
 
Confronting a passive-aggressive person at school or at work requires honesty. Calling the behavior out with no apologies and setting boundaries is essential. Remember, passive aggressiveness is a form of hostility and should be treated as such.
 
What’s more, passive-aggressive people do not openly discuss issues that may be bothering them. As a result, when confronted they may make inappropriate remarks and mumble under their breath.
 Do not let their hostility and inappropriate actions keep you from confronting their behavior.  
Here are some other ways to overcome the negative effect of dealing with passive aggressiveness.
 
When dealing with a passive-aggressive person, be assertive and clear about your expectations. You also want to establish boundaries where needed. Make sure everything you say is factual and not emotional. Being clear and level-headed are the best defenses against a passive aggressive person.
 
Focus on staying calm, keeping your voice neutral and holding your emotions in check. The less you react to their actions, the less control they have over you. Remind yourself that while you cannot keep a passive-aggressive person from slamming doors and pouting, you can only control your response. Respond in a healthy way to their unhealthy behaviors.
 
While confronting passive-aggressive bullies about their behavior is a positive first step, there is no guarantee the person will accept what you are saying. Instead, focus on what you can do to improve the situation like setting boundaries or communicating honestly about how their actions affect you.
 
Remind yourself that a passive-aggressive person’s anger stems from their background and is not your responsibility. You do not have to appease the passive-aggressive person. Stick to what you know is right regardless of their underhandedness or demands.
 
It's challenging to be compassionate and empathetic toward someone that is so difficult to be around. But in the end, it can be very effective. You could say something like: “It seems like you're frustrated by what happened at practice yesterday. That must be difficult.”
 
Remember, passive-aggressive people feel misunderstood. So, if you try to understand where they are coming from, it can go a long way in helping you cope with their behaviors.

When it comes to the mean girl phenomenon, it is not limited to the tween and teen years. In fact, more and more mean girls have grown up but have never changed. As a result, they are infiltrating the workforce in growing numbers. Even though the Workplace Bullying Institute indicates that men still make up the largest number of bullies in the workforce, there are a number of women who also participate in workplace bullying.﻿﻿ 
 
Here are seven signs that the women you work with may be mean girls.
 
Ostracizing other women at work is a sure sign of an office mean girl.﻿﻿ These women use relational aggression to socially isolate someone while attempting to increase their own status at work. 
 Typically, office mean girls are driven by a number of factors including anything from jealousy and a need for attention to a fear of competition.  
As a result, they will act as a clique, leaving other women out of lunch dates, meetings, and after-work gatherings. They may even discuss the details in front of those who are being isolated to demonstrate their power.
 
Usually, these women want what others have, especially at work. And, they are willing to go to any extreme to hurt the person that has what they want. 
 
For instance, an office mean girl might boycott another employee’s ideas, projects or social gatherings. She will even take steps to destroy her target’s reputation and work-related projects. And she is unable to acknowledge anything good about other people due to her struggle with envy.
 
When a co-worker steals your work, this may be due to laziness, insecurity or even incompetence. Whatever the reason, they don’t do their own work, but instead, ride on the success of your work.﻿﻿ 
 
And because they have such a strong desire to get to the top of the corporate ladder, they will do anything to get there including using other people. It is not uncommon for an office mean girl to befriend someone solely on what she thinks she can get from the relationship.
 
Office mean girls are often obsessed with what other people think of them. They consider how everything looks to others. As a result, these bullies target others that threaten their status in some way. 
 
For instance, if they believe another woman is threatening their status or position at the office, they have no qualms about attacking her relationally in order to eliminate the perceived threat. These actions can include making up lies and spreading rumors about her work ethic, her office relationships, and even her personal life.
 
These bullies are toxic women who are systematic, controlled and calculated in their approach. On the outside, this office mean girl appears charming and charismatic, but on the inside, they are cold and calculating. ﻿﻿
 
As a result, they tend to inflict emotional pain on their victims over long periods of time. They also are skilled manipulators. They appear sweet, but this is just another way to manipulate situations to their liking. Girls like these twist facts and situations to make themselves look innocent or to avoid being reprimanded.
 
Sometimes office mean girls have poor impulse control. They are quick-tempered, tend to yell a lot and may even use profanity. These women also are prone to using direct insults and direct name-calling. 
 
They also may dominate meetings by arguing, criticizing, using sarcasm and spewing insults. And they are not above rolling their eyes and coughing to undermine what other people are saying.
 
These women want to be the ones in control and calling the shots.﻿﻿ But instead of earning that right through respect and teamwork, they often speak disrespectfully to others, insist on having things their way and put other people and their opinions down. What’s more, they use the power and control they already have to their advantage.
 
Sometimes, these women are bosses who are bullies. Other times, they have strong personalities, excellent verbal skills or a lot of influence and they use these things to walk over the needs of other people.
 
If you are dealing with an office mean girl, it is important to make the most of your current position, that is until you can find a better place. Make sure you respond professionally and keep documentation of what is happening in case you need. But in the meantime, be sure you also get out and meet other people in your industry.
 
Try to build bridges and network as much as you can. And then when the opportunity presents itself, make the move. You cannot expect to deal with an office mean girl indefinitely, so be on the lookout for a better place.

The problem is so prevalent, you can find clinical studies on the subject. Research on bullying in the workplace quantifies the personal consequences for the victim and fiscal consequences that affect the company's bottom line.﻿﻿
 University of Manitoba researchers found that workplace bullying may inflict more harm on employees than sexual harassment. 
Researchers at the University of Helsinki Department of Public Health found non-target coworkers suffer too.﻿﻿ Their results show victims of bullying and those who witness it are more likely to receive a prescription for psychotropic medications such as:

When it comes to workplace bullying, there are no quick fixes. But there are some things you can do to confront the behavior. The top three things you can do include taking care of yourself, addressing the bullying and seeking outside support. Here are some ideas on how this can be accomplished.
 
Learn to recognize bullying. When you realize that you are being bullied, you will be less likely to blame yourself or take responsibility for something that isn’t your fault.﻿﻿ Remember, bullying is a choice the bully makes, not something defective in you.
 
Realize that you can change your response. Although it is impossible to change someone who doesn’t want to change, you can change how you respond. Take some time to think about how you want to handle the situation. Do you want to search for a new job? Do you want to report the incident? Do you want to request a transfer? Only you can decide how you want to address the situation.
 
Learn how to set boundaries. Be upfront and direct with the bully about how you plan to address their behavior.﻿﻿ Learn to be firm, confident, and assertive. For instance, you could tell the bully if they continue to threaten you with job loss and to sabotage your work, that you will report their behavior to human resources.
 
Keep a journal. Be specific about what you write down. Include the date, the time, the location, the incident that occurred or words that were said and any witnesses to the event.﻿﻿ It also may be helpful to include how it made you feel or how it affected you. You also should record details about the complaints that you filed and the responses you have received.
 Be sure to document any improper behavior. This information will help managers or outside organizations take action. 
Create a paper trail. If you notice your work is being sabotaged, be sure you create a paper trail outlining what you are working on and what you have accomplished. If a bully is trying to force you out or squashes your chances for promotion, the best way to fight back is to make sure others are kept abreast of your projects. Use e-mails, activity reports and other tools to share with your co-workers and supervisors what you are doing. Be humble in emphasizing your accomplishments, but be sure people are aware of the work you are doing.
 
Report incidents. Being silent about bullying gives the bully more power and control over you. When you feel ready, you need to report the bullying to a manager, supervisor, or another person in a position of authority.﻿﻿ Remain calm and keep your emotions in check when sharing details about the bullying. Overly distraught complaints are distracting and may make the message confusing. Also, be consistent with details. It may be helpful to write out what you want to say ahead of time.
 
Keep your report relevant. In other words, share only specific details about the bully’s behavior. Don’t make assumptions or exaggerate details. And don’t criticize the bully as a person or call them names in the meeting. It’s the inappropriate behavior that needs to be addressed. Keep the focus there.
 
Find help for your situation. Report the bullying to the bully’s manager or supervisor. Bullying is a big issue that cannot be handled alone. If the bully is the owner or the manager, consider filing a complaint. Depending on how you are being bullied, you may find protection with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the American’s with Disabilities Act, the local police, or even a local attorney.
 
Surround yourself with empowering people. Find people who can understand what you are experiencing and who will provide support. It helps to talk about what you are experiencing, so don’t keep it inside.
 
Seek professional help or counseling. Being targeted by a bully can have serious consequences. It can affect your mood, your self-esteem, and even your physical health. Be sure to find some outside assistance, especially if you notice you are feeling depressed.﻿﻿
 
Remember that you are not alone. Workplace bullying is a widespread issue.﻿﻿ Don’t let what you are experiencing define you. Instead, find a support group in your area or start one of your own.

Every day, employees across the nation are bullied and abused at work. In fact, the issue of workplace bullying is a growing problem that affects nearly one-fifth of all employees during their careers, according to the Workplace Bullying Institute.﻿﻿
 
If you have experienced workplace bullying, you may be asking yourself “why me?” And you are not alone: workplace bullying impacts 60.3 million Americans every year.﻿﻿ Here are some common reasons why people become ""targets"" of workplace bullies.
 
You may be bullied at work because you receive a lot of positive attention for your work. Maybe you are intelligent, determined, creative, and regularly contribute new and innovative ideas. Or, maybe you go the extra mile and gain recognition for your hard work. Maybe you even move through projects quickly while others are struggling. All these things attract the attention of workplace bullies.
 Workplace bullies target those that have talent because they either feel inferior or they worry that their work is being overshadowed by the other employee's work and abilities. 
Bullying bosses, in particular, will target skilled workers and either steal the credit or undermine the target's work.
 
It is a myth that all victims of bullying are loners and outcasts with no friends or social connections. Often, it is the popular and well-liked workers that are most vulnerable to workplace bullying. If this describes you, bullies believe you pose a threat to their own popularity and social status at work.
 
Office mean girls, in particular, are likely to form cliques and target another woman who threatens their status or social standing. If you are well-liked at work, this could be the reason behind the attacks and jabs at you from the office bully.
 
If you would describe yourself as caring, social and collaborative, this may be the reason that you are being bullied. To a workplace bully, these characteristics drain the power they have at work. Team building is the antithesis of what a bully wants. Bullies want to be in control and to call all the shots. So, you may be targeted by bullies because you are a team player.
 
This does not mean you should change your behavior. It simply gives you some insight into why you are being targeted. You also may be targeted for being ethical and honest. For instance, whistleblowers who expose fraudulent practices are frequently bullied by others at work to keep quiet.
 
If you are introverted, anxious, or submissive, you are more likely to be bullied at work than those who are extroverted and assertive.
 Research has shown that if adults work to build their self-esteem and assertiveness skills, they might diminish the likelihood that they will be targeted by workplace bullies. 
There is also some evidence that depression and other stress-related conditions might attract the attention of bullies. If you are living with any of these conditions, it is important to get treatment. Talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms. Depression, anxiety, and stress-related conditions should never be left untreated. What's more, bullying will just exacerbate your symptoms.
 
In other words, you may be targeted because of your gender, age, race, sexual preference, or religion. You also may be bullied if you have a disability or a disease. Whatever the reason, workplace bullies single out and target people who are different from them in some way. They also tend to discriminate against others. If you are being bullied for any of these reasons, you may have some legal recourse. Consider contacting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to see if you can file a complaint.
 
Unfortunately, adults often bully others for the same reasons kids target others in elementary school. Whether you are short or tall, heavy or thin, have a large chest or no chest at all, workplace bullies will find a way to exploit your appearance. In fact, almost any type of physical characteristic that is different or unique can attract the attention of bullies. This includes wearing glasses, having a large nose, having ears that protrude, and even having adult acne. 
 
If you are experiencing bullying at work, take steps to report it. You also should do what you can to confront the bully. It is never a good idea to let workplace bullying continue without addressing it in some way. Even if you do nothing at all to report the bullying, at least take steps to take care of yourself.

Workplace bullying is a growing problem that countless people face every day. But sometimes people confuse bullying with toughness. If you work for a boss that sets high goals and expects a lot from you and the rest of the team, this does not mean that your boss is bullying you. In fact, employees often automatically assume that tough bosses are bullies. But there are some important differences between bosses who bully and bosses who are tough on their employees. Here are six ways to tell the difference between a tough boss and a bullying boss.
 
A tough boss holds his employees accountable with strict guidelines and high demands, but he also gives his employees all the tools they need to succeed. Meanwhile, a bullying boss might set unrealistic deadlines that are sure to cause failure. He also might change the guidelines causing extra work or withhold necessary information.﻿﻿ He does these things to exert his power and his control of the situation.
 
A tough boss is tough on everyone. He does not single out one person but instead is consistent in his treatment of others. But bullies often question the adequacy of one employee by belittling his opinions and ideas. These bosses also may question one employee’s commitment to the job and dole out unfair criticism and blame. Several hallmarks of bullying behavior are the patterns of unfair behavior and the targeting of one or two people over and over again.﻿﻿
 
A tough boss does not coddle people or tolerate excuses, but he also is willing to roll up his sleeves and help get the job done.
 A tough boss protects his team from adversity within the company and supports them when needed. Meanwhile, a bullying boss is unfair and will sell his employees out to protect his own skin. 
He also might blame others for failures while assuming complete responsibility for all successes. He also shows favoritism among employees and is very clear about who he has disdain for.﻿﻿ He may yell, swear and even engage in name-calling.
 
A tough boss cultivates teamwork and works toward bettering the company. He is willing to work just as hard, and sometimes even harder than his employees to get the job done. But a bullying boss is more interested in being in control and having power over other people. He is a power-hungry leader that thrives on having control over others. He also takes credit for things that he did not do and rarely acknowledges the successes of his employees.﻿﻿
 
A tough boss holds all his employees to the same high standard but is inclusive in the process. As a result, no one feels less valued than another and everyone knows they have to work hard to succeed. Meanwhile, a bullying boss often singles out one or two workers and humiliates and berates them in front of others. He also might ostracize them by excluding them from meetings and social gatherings.﻿﻿ This type of behavior undermines the entire atmosphere of the office and makes teamwork nearly impossible. Instead, employees focus on staying in the good graces of the bullying boss rather than focusing on the job at hand.
 
A tough boss tells his employees like it is. He does not mince words, but he is respectful in the process. Additionally, employees know that they can count on him, to be honest in all situations, even when the truth hurts. Meanwhile, a bullying boss is manipulative. He will control situations by spreading rumors or gossiping about others.﻿﻿ He often pits one employee against another and encourages unhealthy competition. If you find yourself in a situation where your boss is trying to bait you into an unhealthy conversation about another employee, do not take the bait. Maintain your beliefs and values while trying to determine how best to deal with your situation.
 
If you believe your boss is bullying you, this is not an environment that you should try to live with. Remember, dealing with a bullying boss can be exhausting. Consequently, if you are feeling emotionally drained, depressed or anxious, contact your healthcare provider right away. Additionally, you should come up with a plan on how to deal with your situation. Your options include reporting your boss's bullying behavior to human resources or trying to find another job. But it is never a good idea to try to live with workplace bullying.

Workplace bullying, like school bullying, occurs when one person or a group of people intentionally inflict pain or harm on another person in the workplace. Because the effects of workplace bullying are vast and far-reaching, it can jeopardize the targeted person’s health, career, and even home life. And since a large number of bosses are bullies, many bullied employees suffer in silence.
 
Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal bullying, physical bullying, relational aggression, cyberbullying, sexual bullying and sexual harassment, and prejudicial bullying.﻿﻿ But unlike school bullying, workplace bullies and office mean girls may form cliques and operate within the established rules and policies of their organization in both overt and covert ways.
 
For instance, bullying may be couched in humiliating coaching practices or implemented as part of programs touted as being in the best interest of the employee. Or it can involve more overt bullying like berating, publicly humiliating, and ostracizing another person. Regardless of the tactics used, workplace bullies are usually skilled social manipulators who get ahead at work by bullying others.
 
In fact, workplace bullies can be so adept at disguising their behavior that the intended target cannot even spot it. Instead, they internalize the behavior and believe there is something defective in themselves.
 
While there are a variety of reasons why bullies choose to target certain people, their behavior is usually driven by a need to control the targeted individual.﻿﻿ Basically, these employees want to call all the shots and often insist on having things their way. If others do not comply, they become targeted. Many times, these bullies have strong social skills and a lot of influence within the company. As a result, they use these attributes to dominate other people.
 
Sometimes workplace bullies target their co-workers out of envy. They feel threatened by the target’s strengths and accomplishments or insecure about their own abilities. As a result, employees are targeted because they are good workers and get a lot of positive feedback or attention from others within the company. When this happens, the workplace bully wants it to stop. Their bullying tactics then become an attempt to reduce the target's recognition by turning others against them. The workplace bully also wants to ruin the victim's reputation and cast a negative light on the person as a whole.
 
Other times, workplace bullying occurs because the bully has poor impulse control. These employees are quick-tempered, may scream a lot, and sometimes even use profanity. These bullies are prone to hurling direct insults and negative comments. They also may dominate meetings with critical comments and sarcasm.
 
Most experts agree that what sets bullying apart from mean behavior is that bullies intend to harm their targets. This is done through:
 
When there is an imbalance of power, it is hard for the target to defend themselves against the bully’s attacks. Sometimes there is a perceived power imbalance and other times the bully is the target’s boss or supervisor. Perceived power imbalances are harder to distinguish, but examples can include having more social standing at work, having a sharper tongue, or having more influence within the company. The consequences are that the target will feel isolated, alone, excluded, threatened, and vulnerable.
 
Most of the time, bullying does not consist of a single mean act or word. Instead, it is ongoing and systematic. In other words, workplace bullies have zeroed in on the target and lash out multiple times. Sometimes the bullying will consist of the same act over and over again, such as name-calling or berating. Other times, it will consist of a variety of actions, such as taking credit for the target's work, leaving them out of important meetings, sending rude emails, and spreading office gossip. The point is that people can be rude and say inappropriate things, but if it is a one-time incident, it doesn’t constitute bullying. The hallmark of workplace bullying is that the torment is consistent.
 
Another aspect of workplace bullying is the intention of the bully to harm, control, or manipulate the target. Bullies deliberately target other people, undermining their self-esteem and their work. There is nothing accidental about their behavior. And the consequences are significant. Targets of workplace bullying can feel humiliated, ashamed, upset, anxious, and depressed. Some may even develop eating disorders, anxiety issues, or post-traumatic stress disorder.﻿﻿ And a few even contemplate suicide.
 
From overall health, mental state, and physical well-being to job performance and attendance at work, everything is impacted by workplace bullying. Even the victim's home life is affected. Yet, many people do not talk about workplace bullying. In fact, workplace bullying is often referred to as the ""silent epidemic.""
 
For many, workplace bullying is just too painful to discuss. Plus, there are very few laws in place to deal with it. Consequently, many victims often feel like nothing can be done to put an end to it. Other times, victims are too frightened to bring up the issue because they fear they might lose their jobs.
 
Overall, the impact of workplace bullying is significant and can lead to anxiety, subpar job performance, absenteeism, and a general unhealthy work environment.﻿﻿ In turn, all of this results in increased costs for businesses. Employers should take steps to develop bully-proof work environments, such as educating employees, implementing anti-bullying policies, and developing steps for reporting incidents. When they do this, the likelihood that bullying will occur lessens. But even the best prevention programs will not completely eradicate bullying.
 
The key to effectively addressing workplace bullying is handling reports of bullying quickly and efficiently. This sends a clear message to employees that bullying in the workplace will not be tolerated. Unfortunately, many employers are reluctant to handle office bullying situations because they are not sure what to do. But if workplace bullying is left unaddressed, it will only escalate and eventually rob the business of both money and good employees.
 
Employers who want to be successful in reducing the impact of bullying in the workplace will implement clear and concise disciplinary procedures and follow them when an incident occurs.
 
The key to overcoming workplace bullying is to not allow the things that are said and done to you define who you are as a person. It is also important to take steps to report workplace bullying to a supervisor or to human resources. And if things are not resolved or continue to escalate, it may be time to consider looking for employment elsewhere.
 
It is unrealistic to try to endure workplace bullying. Even the most resilient employees will be impacted. Instead, focus on making employment decisions that will benefit your emotional and physical health. And prioritize taking care of yourself. Once you do, you will be on the path to recovery.
 
If you absolutely must keep your job or have no other options for employment, be sure you are diligent in taking care of yourself. Start by exercising and eating right. You should also take time for yourself when you are not working and make a commitment to do the things you enjoy.
 
Look for healthy stress relievers. Focus on your goals and the things that make you happy rather than dwelling on the negativity you experience at work. If you know your limits and work to stay healthy, workplace bullying does not have to have a lingering impact on your life.

Not only is incivility in the workplace on the rise, but according to a recent study, it is compromising one of our most critical assets—our mental health.﻿﻿
 
The authors of the study, published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, looked at the correlation between toxicity in the workplace and symptoms of insomnia, a common symptom of clinical depression.﻿﻿ They wanted to know how, or via which mechanism, incivility in the workplace negatively affected employees' sleep quality, as there has been limited research into this factor.
 
Workplace civility, as described by McKinsey and Company, is “the accumulation of thoughtless actions that leave employees feeling disrespected—intentionally ignored, undermined by colleagues, or publicly belittled by an insensitive manager.”﻿﻿
 
It has also been defined as “low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect.""
 
Sleep is a critical factor in our overall well-being, including our work performance. It has long been established that poor quality of sleep has significant implications for both our physical and psychological well-being.
 
For example, insufficient sleep increases a person's risk of developing serious medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.﻿﻿ Additionally, lack of sleep over time has been associated with a shortened lifespan.﻿﻿
 
In examining the indirect effects of workplace incivility on symptoms of insomnia and thus overall health, the determining mechanism was found to be negative rumination, or the mentally replaying of an event or disturbing interaction with a co-worker long after the workday has ended.
 
""Workplace toxicity leads to adverse effects in part by stimulating people to ruminate on their negative work experiences."" according to the authors. ""Negative rumination represents an active cognitive preoccupation with work events, either in an attempt to solve work problems or anticipate future work problems.""﻿﻿
 
Given that most of us spend the better part of our days and our energy at work, increasing hostility in the workplace doesn’t bode well for our emotional or physical well-being. Research over the past 20 years has associated toxic work environments with increased depression, substance use, and health issues among employees.﻿﻿ Further research has shown that organizations are suffering as well. Some of these adverse effects include decreased productivity, lower levels of employee commitment and increased turnover.﻿﻿
 
The good news is that sufficient recovery or coping techniques may be able to mitigate the negative effects of a toxic work environment on employee well-being. In particular, relaxation and psychological detachment. The ability to psychologically detach from work during non-work hours and relaxation were shown to be the two mitigating factors that determined how workers were affected or not by a negative work environment.
 
Employees who were better able to detach psychologically are able to relax after work and sleep better even in the face of workplace incivility.﻿﻿ Below are descriptions of these recovery experiences and how they were shown to reduce the negative effects and enable employees to thrive in the most toxic of work environments.
 
Psychological detachment represents an avoidance of work-related thoughts, actions or emotions. Some of the items used in the study to measure employees' levels of psychological detachment in the evenings including the following: “I didn’t think about work at all” and “I distanced myself from my work.” Those who were able to detach themselves mentally from this cycle do not suffer as much sleep disruption as those who are less capable of detachment.﻿﻿
 
Detachment can be fostered through a variety of specific activities, including exercise. Planning future events such as vacations or weekend outings with family or friends are examples of positive distractions outside of work.
 
It should come as no surprise that prioritizing work-life balance was shown to be another effective buffer against the detrimental effects of workplace incivility. Relaxation has long been associated with fewer health complaints and less exhaustion and need for recovery.
 
As hypothesized by the authors of the study, relaxation during non-work time served as an important moderator of the relationship between negative work rumination and insomnia symptoms. Additionally, it has been identified as a moderator between work characteristics and occupational well-being, between time demands and exhaustion, and between job insecurity and the need for recovery from work.﻿﻿ Relaxation provides an opportunity for individuals to halt work-related demands, which is critical for restoring individuals to their pre-stressor state.
 
Some activities outside of the office that can foster recovery include volunteering, meditation, taking a walk, listening to music, and spending time with friends and other positive social supports.
 
Based on the results of the study, the authors suggest the following interventions that companies can address to reduce workplace incivility.﻿﻿
 
You may not be able to control certain events during work hours or the characteristics of your workplace environment. However, what you do have control over is how you choose to cope. Most importantly, finding time to relax, spending time with friends and family, and engaging in activities that will shift your focus away from work during non-work hours.
 
If you find that you are still experiencing distressful symptoms and that they are interfering with your functioning, it may be a good idea to speak to a therapist who can help you learn additional strategies for coping.
 
If despite having done all you can still nothing has changed, it might be time to consider the possibility of removing yourself from the toxic environment and looking for a new, more fulfilling and less distressful job. Your health may depend on it.

Many of us take our jobs home with us without realizing it. Work may be stressful, but when we're supposed to be relaxing—from the minute we walk out of the office until the next morning when we come back—we often let job stress seep in instead of making the most of our non-work lives.﻿﻿ There are many reasons we do this, but there are more important reasons why we can and should learn to stop. Read on to gain a greater understanding of how smart people unwittingly magnify job stress, and how you can leave work at work as much as you possibly can. This can decrease your stress levels and increase your overall happiness.
 
We Think About It During Our Commute: The drive home from work could be a time to enjoy the freedom of being off the clock, or it can be a time to ruminate about the stresses of the day, replay frustrations in your mind, and think about everything that's weighing on your shoulders as you battle road rage until you reach home.﻿﻿ All too often, people choose the latter option when the former—letting the drive home be a freeing experience—is so much more beneficial.
 
The problem is that this can magnify stress levels so that they are even higher after the commute home than they were at the end of the workday. If this sounds like you, now is the time to take the reigns and make your commute a time to shrug off the stress of the day. In the coming week, try to really notice your thoughts and habits as you drive home if you're not already aware of them.
 
We Vent About Job Stress to Our Loved Ones: Complaining about work to a loved one is a common pastime of people with stressful jobs. It feels good at the moment but may take a toll over time. While keeping feelings bottled up isn't an optimal answer, when we spend what could be quality time with loved ones focused on all the stresses of the day, we lose more of our day to job stress.﻿﻿ Clearly, the less time we can spend complaining about work, the more time we'll have focused on things that make us happy. This week, try to notice how much time you spend complaining about work and see if this is the right amount of time for you.
 
We Ruminate About Difficult Co-Workers: It's very natural to seek emotional support when dealing with difficult co-workers. However, as with job stress venting in general, focusing too much on the stress created by difficult co-workers can rob us of the joy of our non-work lives. If you find yourself spending non-work hours obsessing over, replaying, or even thinking about the stress that your co-workers bring to your work life, it's time to assess if this is the best way to spend your time and decide how to stop if you need to.
 
We Worry About Work Instead of Relaxing: If you face a heavy load of stress on the job or have the kind of job that requires significant troubleshooting, it can be difficult to shut off the brainstorming part of your brain when you leave work. (This is particularly true for those who work from home.) And if finding solutions is fun for you and it doesn't cut into your personal life too much, it may not be a problem; it may be more of a hobby to think of new ideas for your work, especially if your work feels more like a ""calling"" to you, and not just a job. However, if you find yourself stressing or ruminating over problems at work, it's best to leave that burden at work. (Don't worry, it'll be there when you get back.)﻿﻿
 
We Beat Ourselves Up Over ThisIf all of this is sounding a little too familiar, don't let it stress you. It's fairly common to stress about work when you're not at work, so don't blame yourself. Focus instead on how to shrug off stress and enjoy your life when you're not at work.
 
Tie Up Loose Ends Before You Leave: One of the first and best ways you can leave job stress on the job is to prepare yourself before you leave. To cut down on after-hours troubleshooting, prepare a to-do list for yourself when you get back the next day. This can allow you to come in and feel focused, and it can allow you to leave and feel that things are taken care of as much as they can be until tomorrow.
 
If you are prone to stressing about unsolved problems when you get home, you may even take it a step further and create a list of possible solutions to any issues you think may follow you home; then you can remind yourself you've thought about it as much as you can, and now you need to take your mind off of things and sleep on it. Things will be clearer when you get to work again tomorrow. Knowing this can help you to leave things there.﻿﻿
 
Create a Post-Work Ritual: Just as it helps children relax and go to sleep when they have a bedtime ritual, having a post-work ritual is a great way to help yourself unwind after a stressful day of work. Even better, it can be a way to create a mental habit of relaxing your mind and letting go of job stress after a long day of work.
 
Your routine may consist of something simple like taking a deep, cleansing breath as you walk out and intentionally reminding yourself that you have now left work both physically and mentally. (One martial arts master recommends taking a deep cleansing breath, shaking out your limbs, and mentally leaving your burdens at the door.) It can involve mentally going over what you're looking forward to in the rest of your evening, or texting a loved one and refocusing your attention to your life. Experiment and see what suits you best. Whatever works for you, make it a habit and keep doing it.
 
Enjoy Your Commute Home: The ride home from work can be stressful if you keep replaying the stresses of the day, or letting traffic stress you out even more. With some planning, you can make your commute home into an experience you look forward to rather than another obstacle to overcome before you can relax. One way to maximize your commute time is to listen to audiobooks, either fiction (for fun) or nonfiction in an area where you'd like to grow.
 
Listening to music is also a known strategy for stress relief, and a simple one to do while sitting in an enclosed space.﻿﻿ Mentally counting everything you have to be grateful for can not only make the time pass but can get you into a more positive frame of mind, and prime you to appreciate your loved ones more when you get home to them.
 
Create a Soothing Home Environment for Yourself: Because we spend so much of our non-work hours at home, it's important to have a home environment that soothes your stress rather than one that leaves you feeling more stressed and tired than it should. Because clutter has a subtle but very real effect on our stress levels, it pays to declutter as regularly as possible.﻿﻿ If your home is a haven from stress, it's easier to let job stress melt away once you get there.
 
Treat Yourself: Think about those little treats in life that put a smile on your face, and get more of them into your day. These little happiness-boosters, known as ""pleasures"" by psychologists, can lift your mood in a measurable way and reduce stress in the process. It can be a cup of tea, your favorite comedy, a long walk with a loved one, a soothing bath, or anything else that brings you a bit of joy. Try to mix them up so they have a bit of ""newness"" to them and you'll enjoy them even more. You deserve it.
 
Cultivate Mindfulness: Research shows that those who have a mindful perspective are more able to focus on the present moment and turn their focus away from the stress of the past or anxiety over the future.﻿﻿ This translates into a greater ability to let job stress stay at work and enjoy the time you have each evening and weekend to simply enjoy life. Practicing mindfulness exercises can increase your ability to maintain this present moment perspective, so they are highly recommended for relieving post-job stress as well as for building resilience to stress in general.
 
Enlist Support: If you need to talk about the things that stress you at work before you can let go of them, it helps to have a supportive person who will listen and help you to let go of the stress. (Depending on what helps you the most, this could be someone who validates your feelings and helps you to refocus, who helps you to brainstorm and troubleshoot, or who lets you vent and turn your frustrations into laughter.)
 
Enlisting support can also entail having someone to gently remind you to refocus your thoughts and energy if you start getting bogged down by stressful thoughts of work. Ultimately, if you're feeling overwhelmed by job stress, enlisting help can mean talking to your doctor about stress or finding a good therapist who can help you to come up with coping strategies that work or a new plan.
 
Make Your Non-Work Time Count: Finally, one of the most fun and effective ways to leave job stress on the job is to really focus on making the rest of your life something worthy of your attention and engaging enough to take your mind off of stress if you need it to. This means creating enough balance in your life to include leisure time and hobbies. It means cultivating healthy relationships to help you feel fulfilled and take your mind off of stress. It means creating healthy habits to relieve stress, as well as setting goals that excite you and going for them. Or sometimes it can simply mean enjoying the present moment, whatever you happen to be doing at that moment.

While many people regard working from home as a goal for overall work-life balance, those who find themselves actually doing their work from home report higher levels of stress, according to a 2017 study conducted by the United Nations.﻿﻿
 
In fact, in this study of 15 countries, including the US, UK, Japan, India, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, it was discovered that 41 percent of ""highly mobile"" employees (those who more often worked from home) considered themselves highly stressed as well, compared to only 25 percent of those who worked only on-site.
 
This news may come as a shock to many people who may consider a work-from-home lifestyle to be one that's less stressful and marked with more personal freedom.
 
Part of this stress experienced by those highly mobile workers may be due to the fact that those who work from home face a host of challenges that are unique to this particular setup.
 However, a significant part of this stress is due to higher use of mobile devices, which is perhaps unsurprising in light of other research that connects higher levels of stress to the habit of constantly checking one's phone. Interestingly, there are several factors associated with working from home that both increase and decrease stress. 
It is true that most people love the flexibility that comes with working from home: getting up and going to sleep at times that are dictated more by one's personal body clock and tastes can be wonderfully liberating. It can also get out of hand and feel stressful, however, to be free from the structure that once felt confining.
 
Likewise with the freedom from dealing with obnoxious co-workers. While most people may enjoy having the freedom to choose who they interact with each day (and love to avoid listening to office gossip, complaints, and politics), they may be surprised by the isolation they feel when their interactions aren't automatic and they need to put in an effort to see anyone at all.
 
Many of these factors may balance each other out stress-wise, but the recent UN study suggests that the increased reliance on mobile devices may push the work-from-home crowd over the edge into higher-stress territory.
 A higher reliance on smartphones and laptops is associated with higher stress levels in addition to greater social isolation and even insomnia, both of which are conversely linked with greater stress. 
These experiences may come as a surprise to someone who is new to working at home, but they are commonly experienced. They are also common sources of stress. Here's more on these and other widespread sources of stress for those who live where they work, have zero commute time, and may not realize that they are not alone in the surprising sources of stress they face.
 
Most people are surprised by the stress they feel once the novelty of working from home wears off and the stress of its challenges becomes more apparent. While these stressors may not be the same as long commute times, toxic co-worker interactions, or the feeling of never being alone, they still take a toll. Here are some of the common sources of stress that many work-at-homers face.
 
Feeling a lack of boundaries on when you need to start working (and stop!), when you need to get up and go to sleep, when to log off of social media, and more can feel like true liberation. This feeling, however, can gradually morph into a feeling of being out of control for many who don't expect it.
 Flexible work hours can become too-long work hours as you struggle to fight distractions and get all of your work done, or they can be too-short work hours as others feel entitled to our time because they don't recognize that they are interrupting ""work hours"" for us. 
Later bedtimes can slip into less healthy sleep schedules. And social media can drain hours of productivity when we know there's little risk of others coming into our workspace and demanding to know why we're still on Facebook or Twitter.
 
For many people, that structure that once felt stifling can feel like scaffolding on which we can structure our lives; It can be difficult to create this same structure if we don't realize it needs to be self-imposed. It can also be more challenging to function as efficiently without it.
 
As mentioned, many people forget that those who work at home still need to work—including, sometimes, those who are actually supposed to be doing the working! This means that people can call at all hours of the day and may not understand that, ""I'm sorry, I need to work right now,"" is as valid as, ""Sorry, I'll call you when I'm off work,"" when they know that you set your own hours.
 
The problem is that there can be interruptions all day, and work hours need to be hours and not a succession of interrupted clusters of a few minutes at a time as few of us work as efficiently this way.
 
This can also mean that overnight guests may not understand that people who work from home may need to get up and work in the morning rather than taking a leisurely brunch, or they may need a solitary space to focus or they can't work as efficiently when they do start focusing on their work responsibilities.
 
Solicitors, family members (especially children), well-meaning friends and neighbors may all provide distractions throughout the day, but that doesn't end the list of potential distractions.
 
Email, television, and the siren song of social media can all throw us off as it may seem simple to indulge in a few minutes but it's very possible to be distracted for hours by these things. Social media can provide a seemingly endless supply of fodder to focus on. Once we look up, it may be surprising but entirely possible to see that hours have passed with little to no productivity, putting more stress on the rest of the day.
 
Setting boundaries--creating a structure in your relationship and schedule and ensuring that you don't blur the lines between productivity and leisure time, between socializing time and working time--becomes vital when you work from home. This, however, can be more challenging than many people expect.
 Setting boundaries with others, as mentioned, can be difficult when people expect that you should have time to talk when they do. Setting boundaries with yourself can be even more difficult when you are feeling a lack of motivation. 
When you work from home so you can take care of your children during the day or in the afternoons, it can be even more challenging as you may feel pulled between competing loyalties and overwhelmed by the responsibilities of your various roles. Again, it can be challenging to set boundaries in these situations, and those boundaries may be constantly challenged.
 
Those who work at home may find that the solitude can be a double-edged sword. It is, of course, easier to focus when you're in your own home with no co-workers coming by your desk to chat at random times. But while this solitude can feel blissful at times, when we have no mandate for social interaction during the workday—when we don't automatically run across people outside of those we live with—we can become lonely before we realize it.
 
Social media can feel like a lifeline to others, but this type of interaction can sometimes feel isolating as well, as these interactions can feel less personal than face-to-face encounters and conversations. While we may not need to resort to painting a face on a volleyball and talking to it, the feelings of isolation can sneak up and we can feel more alone than we expect. And given the research on loneliness, this doesn't always feel good. Social isolation was a factor mentioned in the UN study that was related to increased stress of home-based workers.
 
While many people who work from home are self-employed, it can be paradoxically difficult to remain true to your personal goals when you have so many distractions and energy drains. Maintaining a focus on the future is vital if you have goals for changes you want to make, but staying motivated when you are juggling many roles can be a challenge in itself.
 
If you find your resolve weakening, you can start to lose hope that you will achieve the goals you've set for yourself.
 
While all of these sources of stress are significant, the UN study found that working from home in and of itself may not be inherently more stressful than working on-site, but the added stress from frequent use of mobile devices appeared to be a significant source of added stress. Part of the reason is that those who use mobile devices late at night, as those who work from home may be more prone to do, can harm their sleep schedule.
 
Indeed, this study found that it was linked with frequent waking at night: 42 percent of those who work from home report frequent night waking while only 29 percent of office workers reported the same. This is notable because poor sleep can create significant stress throughout the day for several reasons. Social media use can also lead to stress because of increased social comparison.
 
One other factor that seemed to be a deciding one was job intensity; Those who worked from home tended to have more intense, demanding jobs. This may be part of why those who work on-site may be less stressed—perhaps their jobs are less intense. Regardless, this constellation of stressors takes its toll.
 
Fortunately, there are many tools at your disposal and you are not alone in experiencing stress from working at home. While people who work together can gather and discuss the challenges of working in their office environment, those who work from home may need to be more proactive in finding a venue to give and receive support, and to discuss the challenges they face. It can be more challenging to realize that you're not alone in what you're dealing with.
 
Now that you know how common some of these stressors are, you may feel less isolated in what you face. You may also feel more energized in tackling these challenges head-on and minimizing some of the stress that comes with them. Here are some proven strategies for minimizing the stress of working from home.
 
While it's wonderfully freeing to set your own schedule, it's vital that you do set a schedule rather than working when you find the time. If you wait until you feel like working, the distractions will come from all sides and swallow up your time, so setting a schedule and sticking to it is a vital component of working from home for most people. There are several useful tricks for doing so, however, from calendars and apps to detailed to-do lists.
 
Here are some things to keep in mind when determining when you'll work:
 
When you feel isolated, it can be difficult to have as much energy to be productive. Plus, it can be very unpleasant and difficult to sustain for the life of your career. If you work from home and feel a bit too alone, it's important that you take responsibility for your own social life.
 
You can create your own supportive network of colleagues, fellow work-at-home buddies, or like-minded individuals relatively simply through social media groups, planned meet-ups, or even text-chat groups. You can also find already-established groups through social media or online.
 The point is to identify people who share your needs or perspectives, gather them into a group, and benefit from that group! This group can feel like a lifeline when you need someone who understands or want to feel like part of a supportive community. The rest is up to you. 
To keep your motivation up, it's vital to create your own personal rewards. Actually, taking a step back, it's a great idea to break tasks down into smaller, workable steps. However, the point is that it's up to you to make your work experience pleasant, for you to keep yourself feeling appreciated (even if you yourself are the only one who appreciates you), and make forward momentum a regular part of your life.
 
You can do this by breaking down your tasks into smaller goals and then rewarding yourself for taking each step. This keeps people motivated and excited to let go of comfort and move toward the life they really want, even if it takes a sustained effort to get there. (Hint: Rewards don't need to be food-based to be rewarding!)
 
You'll be faced with many requests, most of which you need to refuse if you want to have enough time to get everything done. It can be surprisingly difficult to say no to people you don't really owe your time to, simply because most of us can find reasons why a ""yes"" is a perfectly reasonable answer.
 
We may think of their needs and see ourselves as a great answer for them, and not realize that saying yes to them means saying no to ourselves. We may have our egos involved. Whatever the challenge, realize that saying no to the time drains you didn't plan for often means saying yes to the life you truly want, one step at a time.
 
You may already know that this is a no-no but do it anyway, or you may not be aware yet, but using screens late at night can alter your sleep patterns and make it difficult to get to sleep. It can also make you more wakeful during the night.
 
Because healthy sleep is vital for your productivity, do what you need to do to protect your sleep. (This includes setting a bedtime for yourself and sticking to it.) This can be quite challenging, but well worth the effort.
 
While working from home can provide an amazing sense of freedom and flexibility as well as a no-cost commute, there are pitfalls and hidden stressors to be aware of. By focusing on what you can do to mitigate this stress, you can enjoy the added benefits of a work-from-home situation without the added stress. This is a great step toward achieving an ideal work-life balance.
 Work when you work best. Many people find that working in the morning when they feel rested can provide a more productive experience than beginning work halfway through the day after cleaning house and doing other non-work-related activities. This isn't true in all cases, so feel free to experiment if this advice doesn't seem to ring true for you. Prioritize the challenging tasks first.

The stark reality is that even the most sought-after jobs bring some stress and frustration, often on a daily basis. It may feel natural to come home and vent this frustration to whoever is closest or most sympathetic, and it can feel good while we're doing it. However, many people wonder if this approach does more harm than good. Does complaining about work allow us a healthy outlet for frustration, or does it intensify our stress?
 
There are multiple schools of thought on the subject. Many people fear that if they bottle up their negative feelings about job stress, they may be prone to letting those feelings out at the wrong time or place—like in the boss' office or in front of co-workers—and that venting to a sympathetic ear in the privacy of one's own home is a healthier and more practical alternative. Others feel that complaining is a way to spread negativity and that focusing on the positives or distracting oneself is a better path to peace.
 
Fortunately, researchers have analyzed these questions and can shed some light on the effects of complaining, job stress, and coping with stress so you can learn the facts and see what is truly best for you.
 
Here are a few reasons why complaining about work to loved ones at home might be a good idea.
 
A little bit of complaining about co-workers, bosses, clients, and the daily grind can feel cathartic. It can feel liberating to let it all out when you've been holding frustrations in for an entire day or week. Having that release can be very gratifying in itself. If complaining has subsequent negative consequences, they may not be as noticeable as the positive feelings that immediately follow a satisfying complaint session.
 
Having someone who will listen and validate your feelings can help you to feel closer to that person and helps us to feel less stressed in general knowing that we have people in our lives who understand what we're going through and care.
 
Complaining about work can help a group to feel more bonded, especially if they all face similar on-the-job stress. Sometimes we just want someone to give us a big hug and tell us we're doing a good job, particularly if we don't receive a lot of positive feedback on the job itself.
 
Discussing problems with others always has the promise of leading us to solutions we may not have thought of on our own, and this is particularly true with job stress. There are many instances when a coworker may have a solution that we don't immediately see. There are other times when an interested outsider may find an answer that we don't think of because we're too immersed in the problem.
 Sometimes people complain to receive sympathy or support, but when they complain to find a solution, this type of exchange can lead to real-world results, and that can mean less stress in the long run. 
Many people feel that they might lose their patience if they keep their feelings bottled up. This is a somewhat valid concern. Nobody wants to walk around so frustrated that they lose their temper or say the wrong thing at inconvenient times, so complaining and venting frustrations feels like a far more pragmatic path to take.
 
There are drawbacks to complaining that may make it worth the risk of feeling frustrated. For the following reasons, it's just not worth letting complaining become a habit.
 
Negativity, like an emotional virus, is contagious. (Surprisingly, so is altruism and positivity.) This means that if you complain excessively, you can spread your bad mood, which in turn means that those around you may become more negative and feed it back to you.
 The takeaway here is that you need to be careful how much you complain and to whom you do it. 
This may sound serious, and it is. Any habitual thought or behavior can become easier to repeat, and complaining is no different from taking a certain route to work or reciting the alphabet: the more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. If you habitually complain about work, it becomes more automatic to notice the negative (and more challenging to notice the positive) about other things in life as well.
 
As with the stereotypical parental advice not to make an ugly face or ""it will stay that way,"" there is a real risk to your attitude taking the form of your most habitual thought patterns, so making them positive instead of negative can have a real payoff.
 
You may feel bonded to your co-workers if you share support over a venting session, but chronic complaining can come back to haunt you. You can get a reputation as a negative person or as ""not a team player."" In turn, you can make enemies, which can generally worsen your experience at work—the very place that has you feeling frustrated in the first place.
 
Phony positivity can wear thin eventually, particularly if it comes across as forced, but it's never a bad idea to be careful of your negativity output on the job.
 
While complaining may feel like a healthy release at the moment, it can actually make you feel worse in the long run. This is due, in part, to the fact that expressing anger can actually make it stronger, not weaker.
 
The idea that you need to vent anger or it will become stored up and need to be released eventually is a myth. Letting yourself cool off, refocusing your attention, and expressing your anger in non-aggressive ways can all be more effective and less destructive. 
 
Because complaining puts us in a stressed frame of mind, habitual complaining puts us in the same type of risk that chronic stress does. When the mind perceives a threat (as happens when we remind ourselves of how bad things are at work, for example), the body's stress response is triggered and a cascade of changes occur that help us to fight or flee. If this physical response is triggered repeatedly and constantly, it can bring a host of negative effects on physical and emotional health.
 
Fortunately, there are proactive coping strategies beyond complaining that are more effective at relieving stress without the negative consequences.​
 
While venting to a friend may be bad for both of you if done to excess, writing about your feelings in a journal can be quite beneficial. Journals can help you to process your emotions and make sense of what you're feeling, and they can help you to let things go more easily. Research shows multiple benefits for health and well-being that come with journaling.
 
In the vein of journaling, writing in a gratitude journal can bring added benefits of creating a mental habit of noticing the positive in life and being thankful. This is a thought pattern that's virtually the opposite of complaining, so it can help you to rewire your brain in a much better way. (Plus, over time you'll be creating a record of all the things in life that make you happy, which you can read over at any time.)
 
If you are already in the habit of complaining, you can ""catch yourself"" doing it and then redirect yourself from talking about what's frustrating you to what is pleasing you. Or you can begin with a small amount of venting to release tension but then purposely redirect yourself to more positive topics. Sometimes a small dose of what is comfortable can help you to move more easily into new habits that are less established.
 
All complaining isn't all bad. If you complain (nicely) to someone who can actually help you, you may be able to improve your situation. For example, if you have a situation at work that brings constant stress, talking to human resources may help you to fix the problem rather than simply enduring it.
 The next time you find yourself complaining, ask yourself: Is there something that can be done? Am I complaining to the right person? 
If you find yourself complaining about something you can change, perhaps you are the ""right person"" to complain to, meaning you can also turn your venting session into a brainstorming session and explore what is in your power to change. Then let yourself use frustration for motivation and make positive changes when you can.
 
Those who are able to stay in the present moment longer—that means less stressing about past events or worrying about future ones—are also more able to complain less. This makes mindfulness a powerful habit to practice.
 
You can practice mindfulness in many different ways, but a simple way to start is to focus on your breathing—listening to it going in and out and focus on how it feels in your chest—the next time you find yourself stressing about the past or the future. You can try more mindfulness exercises from there.
 
Finding other stress-relieving habits that work can help you to feel less upset by the challenges you face at work. This can bring you added resilience and happiness in your life.
 
Ultimately, it's best not to take your work home with you in the form of complaining about it after hours unless you're working toward a solution. (They have your time and energy all day—why give them any more of it?) There's rarely a one-size-fits-all approach to stress management, but these guidelines can help you to decide what's best for you. Soon, you'll feel less of a pull to complain, and perhaps feel you have less to complain about in the first place.

Many people don’t take vacations often enough. In fact, according to a poll on this site, around half of those responding don't take annual vacations; in fact, many never take them! And now with increasing frequency, when we do take vacations, we often bring work along with us, keeping ourselves essentially still in the work mindset we’re trying to escape. This is unfortunate for several reasons.
 
A good vacation can help us to reconnect with ourselves, operating as a vehicle for self-discovery and helping us get back to feeling our best.
 
Workers who take regular time to relax are less likely to experience burnout, making them more creative and productive than their overworked, under-rested counterparts.
 
Taking regular time off to ‘recharge your batteries’, thereby keeping stress levels lower, can keep you healthier.
 
One study found that three days after vacation, subjects' physical complaints, their quality of sleep and mood had improved as compared to before vacation. These gains were still present five weeks later, especially in those who had the more personal time and overall satisfaction during their vacations.
 
Spending time enjoying life with loved ones can keep relationships strong, helping you enjoy the good times more and helping you through the stress of the hard times. In fact, a study by the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services found that women who took vacations were more satisfied with their marriages.
 
As the authors of the above study suggest, the psychological benefits that come with more frequent vacations lead to increased quality of life, and that can lead to increased quality of work on the job.
 
It should come as no surprise that vacations that include plenty of free time bring stress relief, but research shows that a good vacation can lead to the experience of fewer stressful days at least five weeks later! That means that vacations are the gift to yourself that keeps on giving.
 
The bottom line is that taking a good amount of time away from the stresses of daily life can give us the break we need so that we can return to our lives refreshed and better equipped to handle whatever comes.
 
While not everyone is able to take a vacation, for those who can take several days or a few weeks off for a trip, even a short respite can be restorative.
 One study showed that a four-day ""long weekend"" vacation had positive effects on well-being, recovery, strain, and perceived stress for as long as 45 days. While the reduction in strain was greater for those who spent the vacation away from home, the other effects were similar for those who stayed home. 
For those who don’t have the time or money to take a ‘formal’ vacation, you can look into cheap vacations and creative ideas on how to get a nice break for less. And don't forget the option of taking a stay-cation or play-cation, too.

Most employees try to be as accommodating as possible when it comes to requests from their bosses. For instance, they will take on extra work, perform tasks not in their job description and will even attend events that interfere with family functions. But there are times during your employment when saying ""no"" to a boss is essential, especially if that boss is a bully.
 
Of course, confronting your boss is not an easy task. It also can be scary. But finding the courage to do so could potentially make your work experience less miserable. In fact, research shows that pushing back may help bullied employees feel less victimized.﻿﻿
 According to a study by researchers at The Ohio State University and the University of Georgia, employees that stand up for themselves not only feel less like a victim but also tend to feel more committed to their job and satisfied overall.﻿﻿ 
What's more, the study also found that they did not suffer the same level of psychological distress as someone who just takes the abuse.﻿﻿
 
Before you confront your boss, make sure the issue is worth taking a stand. Some issues you may want to let play out and see how things progress. But there are other times when you should never accept your boss's treatment or give in to his demands. Remember, regardless of how bad you need your job, you have to know where to draw the line. Here are five scenarios where you should always say ""no.""
 
Bullying in the workplace is a serious issue. Never ever accept abuse, sexual harassment or bullying as the status quo. No matter how much you like, or even need, your job, do not sacrifice your mental or physical well-being by allowing yourself to be victimized. It is just not worth it.
 
Keep in mind that workplace bullying carries significant consequences and can even impact your family if it is severe and ongoing.﻿﻿ As a result, be sure you take steps to stand up to bullying. And if your boss continues to harass you, report it to a supervisor. You also can investigate hiring an attorney or filing a complaint with the Department of Labor, especially if the harassment involves your race or disability. The key is that you do not allow yourself to be victimized by your boss. Take a stand for what is right.
 
Some employers create an atmosphere at work where workplace bullying becomes the norm. They reward employees that step on others to get to the top and overlook their methods for getting there. As a result, the entire workforce begins to feel like excluding others, name-calling and even cyberbullying are accepted practices. 
 
As a result, employees start to believe that to succeed at the company they need to be willing to stab others in the back and slander others who get in their way. There also can be a tremendous amount of pressure to participate in these activities just to keep from being the next victim of workplace bullying.
 
Additionally, workplaces like this also tend to have one or two people that always seem to get the brunt of everyone else's bad behavior. They become the butt of office jokes, are excluded from after-work activities and never seem to be treated with respect. 
 
If you see this type of activity in your workplace, not only should you refuse to participate, but you also should stand up for the people being abused. While you may not be able to completely eradicate bullying from your workplace, you can make it less acceptable for others to participate. You also may be able to influence others to take the high road as well. 
 
Every day in workplaces across the country, employees are asked to do things that are against the law. These illegal activities might include things like fudging some numbers along the way, over-billing a client, firing someone illegally or overlooking safety concerns. When you are asked by your employer to break the law, this puts you in a lose-lose situation. And no matter which way you go, the path will not be easy. 
 
On the one hand, telling your boss ""no,"" could get you fired. But on the other hand, agreeing to the demands puts you, and possibly others, at risk. That's why it is imperative that you refuse to break the law. If you don't say no, not only could you end up with a lawsuit against you but you could also spend time in jail. Additionally, participating in illegal activities damages your reputation and makes finding future employment much more difficult.
 As far as attorneys, law enforcement officers and judges are concerned, obeying your manager's orders to break the law is not an adequate defense. Make sure you say no to anything that requires you to break the law. 
When your boss asks you to do something illegal, you at least have the law on your side when you refuse. Not only is he more likely to back down when faced with the legality of the situation, but he also may want to avoid the risk that you will become a whistleblower on the illegal activity. Most of the time, your boss will rescind his demands. 
 
But standing up to a boss who asks you to do something unethical is a little trickier. Most of the time, unethical bosses do not like to look at themselves in the mirror. So they are not going to like it when you draw attention to the fact that what he is doing, or asking you to do, is wrong. It may even get you fired. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't stand up for what you believe in.
 
Have a conversation with your boss about your concerns. But avoid making accusations or overreacting when you do discuss the subject. Remember, your boss may not even realize that his request borders on being unethical. Give him the opportunity to do the right thing before you take your concerns higher.
 
After your conversation, if your boss still insists that you honor his request, make sure you stand your ground and do not comply. Remember, the consequences you will experience from doing something you disagree with will be steep. Aside from the fact that it will negatively impact your business reputation, you also could experience health issues. For instance, you may develop ulcers, suffer from anxiety and even lose sleep.﻿﻿ Overall, it is never healthy to compromise your values at work.
 
Everyone has to work late sometimes. And it is not uncommon for employees to work weekends. But some bosses are extremely demanding and unreasonable and take these expectations to an extreme. For example, they might require employees to spend countless hours on a frivolous task at the expense of family time. Or, they might demand that employees sacrifice weekends and vacation time to show their commitment to the company. They may even guilt employees into attending a happy hour every night or risk being shunned by the company. At some point, these unrealistic demands can start to feel suffocating and cause an employee to feel like ""enough is enough.""
 
If you find yourself in this type of work situation, you are bound to burn out from the ongoing pressure and the uncertainty of what will be expected of you next. You may even feel like you no longer have a life of your own and work is all you have. You no longer see your family and friends and by the time you get home you are so tired, you do not have the energy to make a healthy meal, exercise or even walk the dog. 
 
Remember, you need to have a life outside of work and if your employer does not allow for this to happen, it will begin to take a toll on you. What's more, working for someone who is unpredictable and unreasonable can cause a number of health issues. Never let the demands of an unreasonable boss steal your health and your life. Have the courage to say ""no"" to his demands.

Who would you expect to experience more stress: the high-powered executive or the worker of lower socioeconomic status? Many people would expect those who hold higher-powered jobs to experience more stress to go with those jobs, but according to research, it's those in lower socioeconomic levels who experience greater levels of stress and more stress-related health problems as well.
 
Consider the following research:
 
People of lower socioeconomic status may experience greater levels of stress and poorer health outcomes for several reasons, including:
 
While some things can't be changed, people of all socioeconomic levels can decrease their lifestyle stress and improve their health by doing the following:
 According to a study published in Psychosomatic Medicine, women of lower socioeconomic status (lower income and education levels) and African American women reported higher allostatic load, which is how the effects of chronic stress accumulate and impact your body in a negative way. Job stress has been correlated with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that have been linked to increased risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. Research has found that those in higher-level jobs experience metabolic syndrome to a lesser degree. Higher-paying jobs bring greater personal control. It's not always the case, but more often it's the higher-level workers who have more personal choices in their lifestyles and more resources at their disposal, leading to lower levels of stress. Those in higher socioeconomic levels tend to make healthier choices. Those of lower socioeconomic status often deal with stress by smoking. They're also more likely to skip breakfast and have a less diverse social network. These factors are all correlated with poorer health outcomes. Higher socioeconomic status brings greater resources for health. Those with lower levels of socioeconomic status tend to have poorer health outcomes because they're less able to take care of their health and even afford health care, among other things. This contributes to greater levels of stress. Lower socioeconomic status children may get less training in stress management. It has been found that some children from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds get less training in critical thinking and in anticipating crises. This is significant because stress can be managed in large part by anticipating stressful events and making plans to reduce their stressful impact. Making healthier choices and planning ahead are behaviors that can be taught, but they may not be taught as much in every family. Stop stress before it becomes severe.

If you've just started a new job, whether it's for the first time or the tenth time, you're probably feeling a little (or a lot of!) stress. There are many new tasks to learn and your boss's or co-workers' expectations may be high.
 
New jobs present many changes and challenges, and it's natural to feel stress over this. There are several things you can do to both relieve stress and combat its effects.﻿﻿
 
Here are some effective things you can do to deal with stress at a new job or in any other situation that requires change and adjustment.
 
If you can, get support from co-workers, from friends or family, or even an online support group. Talking about what's stressing you out and finding resources should help a lot.﻿﻿
 
You may feel like it shows weakness to ask your co-worker or boss questions, but asking for help lets them know you're working hard to understand how things flow rather than trying to do something you aren't sure of on your own (and potentially messing it up).
 
A side benefit of asking questions is that you can start building a rapport with your boss and/or co-workers.
 
Every job is tougher at the beginning as you figure out what's expected of you and how to best perform your tasks.
 
Like everything in life that we do repeatedly, it will get easier and before you know it, you'll have found a routine and rhythm and you'll feel confident in your job and your ability to do it. Keep this in mind when you start to feel stressed or overwhelmed.
 
Have some quick stress relievers that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed.﻿﻿ Breathing exercises, for example, can help slow or reverse the fight-or-flight response you experience when stressed, which saves the wear and tear on your health that chronic stress can cause.
 
Taking a walk can also help calm you down, or you can keep a stress ball or a fidget spinner at your desk to channel any extra energy and nervousness you might have.
 
Try to maintain some time in your life to do some stress-relieving activities, so that you feel less stress overall.
 
Ideas include regular exercise, yoga, and engaging in a hobby or another activity that you enjoy, such as drawing, painting, writing, woodcarving, playing an instrument, talking to a friend, listening to music, meditation, gardening, bowling, or fishing. The options are endless!
 
If you're able to eat right, get enough sleep, and take daily vitamins, you'll be less worn down physically so you'll be less reactive to stress, and you'll be in better overall health too.﻿﻿
 
Taking care of yourself also boosts your cognitive abilities so you can concentrate and focus better at work.

The need to find strategies for handling difficult co-workers is one of the most common among those who work in an office environment. Whether it's the office gossip who spreads whatever dirt they hear, the slacker who expects to offload his responsibilities onto others, or any of the myriad other office stereotypes, there seems to be at least one in every office.
 
Because avoiding them is sometimes not an option, many people wonder about the best way to deal with these stress-inducing energy-drainers, and the solutions can't come too soon. Fortunately, there are a few ""best ways"" that can work, in terms of reducing their impact on your stress levels.
 
While all people are different, there are some basic universal options for dealing with difficult co-workers. You can try one or more to improve your situation:
 
Whether you have a formal Human Resources department or just one person who supervises everyone, there should be someone who's 'in charge' of employee peace-keeping. You can document your concerns and take them to this person. If you do, be specific about what is upsetting you. For example, don't say, 'This person is driving me crazy!', say, 'This person habitually asks me to do her work while she visits chat rooms', or whatever the case may be.
 Without making personal attacks, calmly state the behavior that's bothering you, and ask if something can be done. 
The next time Your Nemesis does something that you object to, in an assertive (rather than aggressive) way, speak up. Politely, but firmly, say that you don't appreciate the off-color jokes, don't want to do their extra work, or tell them whatever else is on your mind. You may not get a positive response at first, but you may. And you'll also get the benefit of speaking your mind, and will at least get the message out there for everyone's consideration.
 
If the problems don't affect you too strongly, you may choose to get better at ignoring them. This may seem difficult at first, but there's something to be said for choosing your battles. If you are dealing with someone who tells your secrets around the office, stop sharing them. If you're dealing with someone who has offensive body odor, stay at a comfortable distance.
 Not everything can be ignored, but by focusing on other things, some problems can bother you much less than you would think. 
If you've talked to your co-worker, human resources, and everyone else there is to talk to, you can't live with the problem, and nothing else can be done to change it, and this person causes you significant daily stress, you may consider changing jobs. It's sad if things have to come to this, but there may be a better job out there for you, and you wouldn't have been seeking it out if you didn't have a difficult co-worker prompting you to make a change. There are potential positives in every situation. The trick is to find them.

When young people are considering their future career choices, they are often given advice to follow their passion and look for work that involves passion and meaning. However, in a challenging job market, many people feel the need to take jobs that are less than their ideal but will do for now. This means that many people are in jobs that they like but don't love—or sometimes don't even like.
 
Do you wish you had a better job? Fun jobs aren’t just for the very lucky; believe it or not, most ‘regular jobs’ can be turned into ‘fun jobs’ with some tweaking. This is good news for many people, who find themselves in a difficult job climate and may not want to risk quitting a safe job in search of a job that's more enjoyable. Interestingly, what makes a job fun depends on the individual—and virtually everyone can take steps to make their current job more enjoyable to them personally, so different people in the same organization can take on different responsibilities that may complement each other.
 
The desire to make a job more enjoyable isn't a frivolous one. While fun jobs can contain some stress, people generally find these types of jobs—jobs that fit their needs in terms of utilizing their unique strengths and providing the right type of challenge and meaning—come with less clock-watching, less Monday morning dread, less stress. And because job stress is one of the most commonly-experienced stressors, this is clearly something that many people face and would like to be rid of. The following steps can help people take their current jobs more fulfilling and less stressful. Ready? Let’s have some fun!
 
Think about the times in your life when you experience flow—you lose track of time, you feel inspired, and things feel really easy for you. Is it when you’re doing specific activities such as organizing people, troubleshooting problems or decorating a space? Or in daily life, do you find certain aspects of your day tend to feed you emotionally, like when you’re engaged in conversation with people, cracking jokes, or spending time alone? See if there are ways to work these things into your current job: be the office party planner, for example, if you love to plan events; volunteer to deal with disgruntled customers if conflict resolution is your forte; maintain a sense of humor throughout the day if at all possible. Jobs that lend themselves to flow are generally experienced as fun jobs.
 Sometimes creating flow in your workday means adding new responsibilities that include the right level of challenge and meaning rather than swapping activities that are less enjoyable for these more enjoyable activities, which are known as gratifications. 
This can be worth the effort, even if it means slightly more work. This type of activity can relieve stress and involve more meaning and enjoyment in your job, it can be well worth the extra effort.
 
Think about ways that your current job helps people, or could help people. We have all experienced sales clerks who clearly hate their jobs and don’t want to be there, and sales clerks who take time to talk to us and make our day special. The clerks who go out of their way to spread happiness are providing a real service and are also more likely to think of their jobs as ‘fun jobs’ than the first group.
 
How does your job allow you to touch people’s lives? You may be able to share positivity to people you encounter, you may find opportunities to help others by sharing your expertise, or you may even inspire others. Jobs that make the world a better place lend a sense of satisfaction and are likely to be experienced as fun jobs.
 
Use your creativity and share your special gifts in your current job, and you may find your experience of your job transformed. Look at how your job can contribute to society in a positive way, and find greater meaning in your work. Focusing on the intangible rewards of work can transform most jobs into fun jobs, and can reduce job stress as well. Have fun!

How many times have you started your day looking at a long to-do list, checking numerous emails, forecasting multiple appointments and obligations for the day and wondering how you are going to get it all done? Our world is busy and continues to place demands on our time like never before. We are often juggling responsibilities at work and at home, trying to find time to take care of ourselves and maybe even have fun once in a while. As much as we may complain about being busy, we seem to not be slowing down at all. What is the appeal of being busy and how might it be getting in the way of you living your best life?
 
So often we tend to view being busy as a badge of honor or a way to establish status and a sense of worth. This line of thinking tends to make sense in our society because, for the most part, it is still fairly individualistic and no one wants to feel like they are being left behind. We are wired for connection and want to not only belong but feel important, as if being perceived as important or needed better secures our connections with others.
 
Living in the world means that we are interacting with others. From an early age, as we are learning about the world and how we fit into it, we begin to look at what others are doing as a point of reference.
 
Psychology Today describes social comparison theory as, ""... determining our own social and personal self-worth based on how we stack up against others we perceive as somehow faring better or worse.""
 
As we go through various seasons of life we look around and, not only notice what others are doing, but place value and meaning to what we see. We then use this value and meaning to look at ourselves and what we're doing to determine where we stand.
 
In our observations of the world around us, we might start to notice patterns of what seems to help people gain things like:
 
As we notice these patterns, it is common to naturally incorporate that information into our narrative of who we are, who we want to be, or who we believe we are supposed to be. The values of society start to integrate with our development of values and tend to guide our decision making.
 If our desire is to feel connected, successful, accepted and influential, then we are going to look and see what seems to work to help people achieve those things. 
In our society, one of those behavior patterns we are likely to notice could include someone who is always on-the-go, overscheduled, and moving in a variety of directions at once. Naturally, our observations tell us that is what we should be doing as well if we want success, connection, acceptance, and influence.
 
As a human being interacting with other human beings, it is fair to say that we are apt to consider what others think of us. Admittedly, we are looking around observing others and placing meaning and value to their behavior and assume others would be doing the same with us, observing our behavior and placing value to what they see us doing or not doing.
 
We learn that how we show up in the world seems to matter. If we have learned through our own social experiences that certain patterns of behavior, such as being extraordinarily busy and constantly on-the-go lead to being successful, connected and accepted by others, then we may find it appealing to engage in those behaviors.
 
Harvard researcher and professor Matthew Lieberman, Ph.D., studies the neuroscience of human connection and suggests that our need to connect is as fundamental as our need for food and water. He states in his book, Social, ""We intuitively believe social and physical pain are radically different kind of experiences yet the way our brains treat them suggests that they are more similar than we imagine.""
 
In other words, when we feel social pain, such as feeling judged or rejected, it matters to our mind, heart and our bodies. We want to avoid that kind of pain, so we do what we can to avoid having to experience it.
 Being busy can possibly offer us a sense of assurance that we have secured a social place within our community. We see ourselves as plugged in, connected, and valued and assume other people likely see us the same way as we continue to demonstrate our excessively busy behavior. 
However, the pain of rejection or disconnect that we are trying to avoid may not outweigh the pain we put our minds and bodies through by glorifying busyness and being constantly on-the-go.
 
Many of us have been in situations where we have gone through the day feeling extremely busy and overcommitted in our scheduling and obligations, yet look back on our day not feeling particularly productive.
 
Being busy and being productive can often be confused with one another. However, being productive means more than running around endlessly and feeling over-extended. Merriam-Webster defines the word productive as, ""Yielding results, benefits or profits."" Essentially, it means that we have something to show for our hard work. Being busy has to do with an amount of time, where productivity has more to do with our use of time.
 
When we glorify busyness we are likely to overextend ourselves with varied obligations, appointments, commitments, and responsibilities.
 
There are many ways in which this lifestyle can impact our emotional health, such as leaving us to feel:
 
In our attempts to preserve connection and secure our sense of value by being overly busy, we end up taking on too much and can easily become flooded with negative emotion and even feeling isolated from others.
 
When we are unable to complete tasks or adequately fulfill the many obligations we have dedicated ourselves to, we can feel guilty and ashamed for letting people down or letting ourselves down. The reality is that our expectations were likely unrealistic and the ability to follow through successfully would have been impossible.
 
Over time, the experience of these emotions can leave us feeling as if we will never be enough. People who glorify busyness tend to find self-worth through tasks, performance, and accomplishment.
 
It might be easy to understand how this cycle of taking on too much and not being able to adequately follow through can impact our feelings of self-worth, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. If we fear others might see us as incapable as well, our social self is threatened and the very pain of rejection or judgment that we are trying to avoid can have room to creep in.
 
Shuttling from one appointment to the next and having no time to spare in our schedule causes us to get creative in how we are feeding ourselves, moving our bodies, and resting. In other words, we end up making poor choices in all of these areas because we either don't have time to make careful choices or our emotional reservoir is dry due to exhaustion and our impulsive decision making takes over.
 
Eating drive-through or quick processed foods, skipping exercise, and getting very little sleep are common practices for people who glorify busyness. The risk of not being able to socially keep up or feel valuable is too great and, in turn, our physical health and well-being can become compromised.
 
The ways in which excessive busyness can impact our physical health include things like:
 
When we are stretched thin for time and already unable to effectively follow through on our multitude of commitments, it is understandable that our relationships would suffer as a result of being excessively busy.
 
As with other things, relationships need time and energy to continue growing. If you are often overscheduled and overcommitted, you likely have neither time nor energy to spend nurturing your relationships with others.
 
Overall, relationships can be fairly flexible. We understand when people are busy and that it can be difficult to schedule time to chat or connect, especially as adults. However, when someone is chronically busy they can appear unapproachable, detached, and uninterested to those around them.
 
As described in many types of couples therapy such as Emotionally Focused Therapy, there are three main components to look for in healthy, connected relationships: Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Engagement. When our relationships are lacking in one of these areas, it is likely we don't feel very connected.
 
Demanding, overextended schedules leave no time for meaningful connection. In our efforts to preserve relationships, we may send a quick text or attempt to make plans. Over time, especially when attempts to get together are disrupted by last minute changes, people can feel devalued and be less willing to compromise and forgive. Patterns of broken connection lead to people feeling distant and uninterested in maintaining connections. Relationships with friends, family, spouses, and even children can be impacted by the glorification of busyness.
 
Creating change in the area of busyness can offer us improved physical health, greater peace and joy, and better, more connected, relationships. Having time for others and ourselves can offer us that sense of safety, value, and connection we were once looking for by being so busy.
 
Some of the benefits can include:
 
When we are excessively busy and glorify the idea of busyness, it is common to gain our sense of self-worth through tasks, performance, accolades, and recognition from others.
 
Most can agree these things feel good in the moment but, overall, don't seem to fulfill our sense of self-worth in a meaningful and substantial way. The good feelings do not last long before we tell ourselves it isn't enough and we feel pushed to move on to the next task or performance.
 
As we work to make intentional change in how we spend our time, it is helpful to reexamine where our sense of self-worth has been coming from and how well it has worked. Take a moment to evaluate your core values and allow yourself to be honest with what may have a longer-lasting impact on your positive self-worth. An example of this could be recognizing that over-scheduling yourself leaves you feeling exhausted rather than valued.
 
In exploring your core values you may find that spending time with family offers you a more meaningful sense of connection and value, and choose to set aside more time for that during the week or on the weekends.
 
Our narrative is what we tend to tell ourselves about who we are, our worth, our abilities, and our purpose, among other things. Being excessively busy is usually a result of our desire to feel worthy, valuable, and connected but can end up leaving us feeling isolated, exhausted, and inadequate.
 
As you begin to make changes in scheduling and setting healthier boundaries around your time, you may find the need to challenge an old narrative that says you are not enough if you're doing all things all the time. It can feel unnatural to slow down a bit and cause you to feel vulnerable. Allow yourself the opportunity to challenge your old narrative and update it with a healthier view of self, your worth, and your purpose.
 
People who glorify busyness and are chronically overscheduled tend to have difficulty setting boundaries with others and being assertive. As you learn to say no to excessive projects, tasks, and appointments, you may fear how people respond to you, especially if they are not used to hearing no from you.
 
Remember why you are taking better control over your time and keep the big picture in mind. Managing time and ridding yourself of excessive busyness is likely about connecting with friends and family, taking care of your physical health, and living with more peace and joy. Remind yourself of those things as you determine where to set boundaries. It is not so much about saying no to the person in front of you as it is about saying yes to yourself and the people who mean the most to you.

Research has indicated that the percentage of Americans who are stressed at work is high—and it’s only getting higher. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, 29 to 40% of Americans report being “extremely stressed at work.""﻿﻿
 
Work stress has significant health consequences that range from relatively benign (like getting more colds and flus) to potentially serious (such as heart disease and metabolic syndrome).﻿﻿
 
While stress at work is common, finding a low-stress job is hard (if not impossible). A more realistic approach is to adopt effective coping strategies to reduce stress at your current job. Here are some stress management techniques you can try if you are finding it hard to cope with work stress.
 
After scrambling to get the kids fed and off to school, dodging traffic and combating road rage, and gulping down coffee in lieu of a healthy breakfast, many people arrive to work already stressed. This makes them more reactive to stress in the workplace.
 
You might be surprised by how affected by workplace stress you are when you have a stressful morning. When you start off the day with planning, good nutrition, and a positive attitude, you might find that the stress of your job rolls off your back more easily.
 
A factor known to contribute to job burnout is unclear requirements for employees. If you don’t know exactly what is expected of you, or if the requirements for your role keep changing with little notice, you might become extremely stressed.
 
If you find yourself never knowing if what you are doing is enough, it may help to have a talk with your supervisor. You can take the time to go over expectations and discuss strategies for meeting them. This can relieve stress for both of you!
 
Interpersonal conflict takes a toll on your physical and emotional health. Conflict among co-workers can be difficult to escape, so it’s a good idea to avoid conflict at work as much as you can.
 Don’t gossip, don’t share too many of your personal opinions about religion and politics, and steer clear of ""colorful"" office humor. 
When possible, try to avoid people who don’t work well with others. If conflict finds you anyway, make sure you know how to handle it appropriately.
 
Even if you’re a naturally disorganized person, planning ahead to stay organized can greatly decrease your stress at work. Being organized with your time means less rushing in the morning to avoid being late as well as less hustling to get out at the end of the day.
 
Keeping yourself organized can also mean avoiding the negative effects of clutter, and being more efficient with your work.
 
Another surprising stressor at work is physical discomfort, often related to where you perform most of your daily tasks (such as your desk).
 
You might not notice you're stressed if you're sitting in an uncomfortable chair for just a few minutes, but if you practically live in that chair when you’re at work, you might have a sore back and be more reactive to stress because of it.
 
Even small things like office noise can be distracting and cause feelings of low-grade frustration. Do what you can to create a quiet, comfortable, and soothing workspace.
 
Multitasking was once heralded as a fantastic way to maximize one’s time and get more done in a day. However, people eventually began to realize that if they had a phone to their ear and were making calculations at the same time, their speed and accuracy (not to mention sanity) often suffered.
 
There is a certain ""frazzled"" feeling that comes from splitting your focus and it doesn’t work well for most people. Instead of multitasking to stay on top of your tasks, try another cognitive strategy like chunking.
 
Many people feel the ill effects of leading a sedentary lifestyle. You can combat the physical and mental effects of work stress by getting some exercise on your lunch break.
 
If your schedule allows for it, you might try taking short exercise breaks throughout the day. This can help you blow off steam, lift your mood, and get into better shape.
 
Being a high achiever might make you feel good about yourself and help you excel at work, but being a perfectionist can create problems for you (and those around you).
 
You might not be able to do everything perfectly, every time—especially in a busy, fast-paced job. A good strategy to avoid the perfectionism trap is always striving to just do your best and making time to congratulate yourself on your efforts. You may find that your results are better and you’ll be much less stressed at work.
 
Listening to music offers many benefits and can be an effective way to relieve stress before, during, and after work. Playing an uplifting song while you make breakfast can help you start the day off feeling better prepared to interact with the people in your life. Likewise, combating the stress of a long day with your favorite music on the drive home can help you wind down and feel less stressed when you get there.

Job stress is widely experienced, and so pervasive that it’s been found to affect people from all industries, levels and income levels. And because so much of our lives are spent at work, job stress can spill over and create issues in other areas of life as well. Anxiety at work can eventually cause you to experience burnout or depression, especially if you don't know how to protect yourself against the potential effects of stress. Without significant changes, prolonged stress can even cause serious physical problems like heart disease. 
 
There are several types of stress that people experience, and they each affect people differently. There’s eustress, the kind of feeling you get on a rollercoaster or going down a ski slope; it's exciting and invigorating. There is also acute stress, which comes and goes quickly. These types of stress aren’t especially harmful in manageable doses, though too much of either can lead to a greater risk of experiencing chronic stress. This type of stress often comes from conflicted relationships, over-packed schedules, and demanding jobs. 
 Chronic stress comes from situations where your stress response is triggered again and again without giving you a chance to relax and recuperate. 
When job stress turns chronic, it can really threaten our physical and emotional health in many ways. Here is just some of the research that shows how:
 
Certain sources of job stress can greatly contribute to chronic job stress and burnout:
 
Because job stress is a leading cause of chronic stress, managing factors we experience on the job can cut out significant levels of anxiety and lead to greater wellness and happiness. It’s important to take steps to take care of oneself and one’s body. The following strategies can help you stay healthy and potentially reverse many of the negative effects of stress in a surprisingly short amount of time:
 One study that assessed over 11,000 people found that employees reporting high psychological and physical job demands and low job control had elevated risks of emotional exhaustion,  psychosomatic and physical health complaints of all kinds and job dissatisfaction. According to a study by the British Medical Journal, chronic stress has been linked to the development of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as other conditions. This is because they found a link between chronic job stress and metabolic syndrome, which is a group of factors that increase the risk of diseases like high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and obesity. They found that greater levels of job stress increased people’s chances of developing metabolic syndrome. Workers who have higher levels of job stress experience a greater incidence of the common cold, and call in sick more often. There has also been a documented link between high job stress and increased risk of mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety disorders.  Job strain, less independence, low social support, high psychological demands, effort-reward imbalance, and high job insecurity predicted common mental disorders in a review of several different job stress studies. These job stress factors seemed to affect men and women of every age equally.  Reduce Daily Stressors: You can reduce stress in your life by making lifestyle changes like becoming more organized, better managing time and making other changes at work. Getting enough sleep, eating nutritious foods and maintaining a positive outlook are also important in overall health.  Learn Stress-Reducing Practices: Learning and practicing a stress management technique or two can also help your health by activating your body’s relaxation response. You can read about ten stress-relieving practices; one or two of these could become an important part of your life and a valuable tool to stay healthy. Find Ways to Reduce Stress at Work and Enjoy Your Job More: Part of job stress relief involves making changes at work that can increase satisfaction and cut down on factors that cause stress and burnout. You can learn more about how to do this by reading about finding greater satisfaction at your current job, creating a fun job experience, and assessing and eliminating burnout-related stressors.",job stress widely experience pervasive find affect people industries level income level much live spend work job stress spill create issue areas life well anxiety work eventually cause experience burnout depression especially know protect potential effect stress without significant change prolong stress even cause serious physical problems like heart disease several type stress people experience affect people differently eustress kind feel get rollercoaster ski slope excite invigorate also acute stress come quickly type stress especially harmful manageable dose though much either lead greater risk experience chronic stress type stress often come conflict relationships pack schedule demand job chronic stress come situations stress response trigger without give chance relax recuperate job stress turn chronic really threaten physical emotional health many ways research show certain source job stress greatly contribute chronic job stress burnout job stress lead cause chronic stress manage factor experience job cut significant level anxiety lead greater wellness happiness important take step take care oneself one body follow strategies help stay healthy potentially reverse many negative effect stress surprisingly short amount time one study assess people find employees report high psychological physical job demand low job control elevate risk emotional exhaustion psychosomatic physical health complaints kinds job dissatisfaction accord study british medical journal chronic stress link development heart disease type diabetes well condition find link chronic job stress metabolic syndrome group factor increase risk diseases like high blood pressure insulin resistance obesity find greater level job stress increase people chance develop metabolic syndrome workers higher level job stress experience greater incidence common cold call sick often also document link high job stress increase risk mental health issue depression anxiety disorder job strain less independence low social support high psychological demand effort reward imbalance high job insecurity predict common mental disorder review several different job stress study job stress factor seem affect men women every age equally reduce daily stressors reduce stress life make lifestyle change like become organize better manage time make change work get enough sleep eat nutritious foods maintain positive outlook also important overall health learn stress reduce practice learn practice stress management technique two also help health activate body relaxation response read ten stress relieve practice one two could become important part life valuable tool stay healthy find ways reduce stress work enjoy job part job stress relief involve make change work increase satisfaction cut factor cause stress burnout learn read find greater satisfaction current job create fun job experience assess eliminate burnout relate stressors

Everyone has to deal with varying levels of stress. This can be particularly difficult to manage if you also have symptoms of depression or anxiety. When you feel like your stress levels have reached their peak, it might be time to take a quick break to reset.
 
Sometimes taking a mental health day—a day off that's specifically geared toward stress relief and burnout prevention—is the best thing you can do for yourself. While one day might not solve heavy underlying problems that lead to burnout, a mental health day can provide a much-needed break to pause, regroup, and come back with greater levels of energy and a fresh, less-stressed perspective.
 According to research conducted by the World Health Organization, anxiety and depressive disorders cost more than a trillion dollars globally in lost productivity each year.﻿﻿ 
Whatever stressors you face, these tips can help you take a mental health day and make the most of it.
 
Once you have decided to take a mental health day, the question then becomes ""when and how?""
 
The best way to avoid feeling stressed about taking a day off is to schedule a day off ahead of time, ensuring that you've taken steps to rearrange your workload or find a replacement for the day. However, if you wake up in the morning and just feel that you can't face the stress of the day, this may be a good time to take a mental health day and make the most of it.
 
The decision of when to take a mental health day really depends on your personal situation. If your employer is supportive and you are comfortable sharing your reasons, feel free to plan a mental health day out in advance. If you don't want to divulge your reasons for taking a day or if your employer is less understanding, don't feel obligated to share.
 While there has been a growing movement to destigmatize mental health issues in the workplace, many employers still do not support mental health concerns as a legitimate reason to miss a day of work. 
You can:
 
Weekends work well, too. While a ""traditional"" mental health day generally includes taking a day off from work, it's not necessary to call in sick to take a day to focus on stress relief.
 
Knowing what you can expect to get out of a mental health day is important. It's important to remember that it isn't a day to hide from your problems. 
 An effective mental health day can help you: 
Problems can seem harder to deal with when they seem close, overwhelming, and inescapable. Taking a mental break from work and spending some time on self-care can sometimes give you the mini-break you need to head back into things with a clear head.
 
Sometimes this one is a no-brainer—if you're exhausted, your body will be screaming that it needs to rest. Of, if you feel you can't face another day of hard work, you may just need to have some fun. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you may not be as aware of your needs.
 
Take a minute and really reflect: Would you benefit the most from some tension relief? Or from making a few changes that will relieve stress in the future? Some time with a loved one? Or just a change of scenery? As different stressors require different responses, different types of mental health days fill unique needs.
 
Taking a mental health day often means taking time out to relax. That can mean watching TV in pajamas for hours, or puttering around the house and doing nothing. As long as this isn't an everyday thing, that's fine. Some activities can take a little front-end effort and feel immensely relaxing once they're completed.
 
Some things you can try include:
 
The key is to spend time doing an activity that you find relaxing, whether it's taking a hike, exploring a museum, or just spending some time immersed in a good book.
 
There are plenty of ways to spend your day, whether you decide to catch up on some much-needed sleep, indulge in a hobby you love, or hang out with a friend. Spend your day on activities that boost your physical and mental wellness.
 
If you really need a change of scenery and a ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" kind of mental health day, be sure you make the most of it. Plan at least one fun event—either something you normally love to do and don't do often enough, or something you've always wanted to try. Take a good friend along, if possible, to really make the day memorable.
 
If nothing grabs your attention, try to engage in activities that provide just the right type of challenge: Hobbies, games, and the like.
 
If the stressors seem to pile up and you're looking for a way to slow down and stop the ""noise,"" you may want to take a day to restructure things. You may not be able to eliminate all of your ongoing stressors in a day, but you might be able to make a significant reduction in a few areas, which may, in turn, create a lasting impact on your stress levels.
 
You can start to eliminate stress by:
 
Don't expect to be able to take on all of this in a single day. If you want to use your mental health day to make real changes in your life, use it as a chance to evaluate, plan, and get ready to work on those changes.
 
If you're concerned that your overall stress levels need more than just a mental health day, consider taking a staycation or vacation. You may also consider whether you're headed toward burnout.
 
Online resources can also help, and you may want to also bring up your concerns with your doctor, or talk to a mental health professional. There are many steps that can be taken to help.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with mental health issues, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Look for ways to keep stress levels low and so that you don't wake up one morning in dire need of an ""emergency mental health day."" A mental health day can be useful on occasion, but you should also strive to make your mental health a priority every day.

If you’re overstressed and at risk for job burnout, you may feel that a major life overhaul is necessary for you to be able to enjoy your job and avoid burnout.
 
Before making major changes, try some minor adjustments. They may help you enjoy your work and give you food for thought on whether major changes are truly necessary.
 
It’s nearly impossible to do a good enough job at your work if you don’t know what the requirements are. Unfortunately, sometimes it’s difficult to know all of the requirements at a job when those in charge are poor communicators.
 
Some bosses and supervisors are vague with expectations, assign new tasks with little advance notice, request new tasks without providing training, and inadvertently set workers up to fail in other ways.
 
While you can’t prevent things like this from happening altogether, you can gain a clearer view of what you need to do and help your situation quite a bit with assertive communication skills.
 Learning to speak up for yourself in a respectful way can help improve your work life and decrease your risk for burnout. 
We all need to feel recognized and rewarded for what we do. If your job doesn’t have built-in opportunities for recognition, or if rewards are infrequent, you may need to add rewards and recognition to your own life.
 
You may decide to take yourself to a movie, have a home spa experience, buy yourself something nice, or give yourself other small but nurturing rewards when you complete a project or complete another month of hard work.
 
You can also team up with a supportive friend and agree to listen to each other’s successes and provide support to one another if you don’t get that support and recognition from your job.
 
These things can nurture you emotionally and remind you of the importance of the work you do, especially if you work in a job or field where these rewards are sparse.
 
Keeping balance in your lifestyle is important; if it’s all work and no play, you may find your ability to work beginning to wane. In order to maintain balance in your lifestyle, the first step is to take an overview of your current lifestyle and see which areas are out of balance.
 
Do you have enough time for relationships, hobbies, sleep, self care, exercise, healthy eating, and other important features of a healthy lifestyle, in addition to your work responsibilities? If not, the next step is to look at your priorities and make some changes so that your lifestyle reflects them better.
 
You can usually change your experience of your current circumstances by changing your attitude about them. Developing an optimistic point of view and changing negative self talk patterns can go a long way toward helping you see the glass half-full, as well as actually making you more productive and less stressed.
 
Assess your current state of mind, and make some changes in yourself so that you see things in a more positive light, and you may just find you’re much happier where you are in life.
 
Certain features of your personality make some jobs a better fit for you than others. If you’re in a job that’s not well-suited for your personality, you may be putting yourself under unnecessary stress every day you go to work.
 
The following are some good questions to ask yourself:
 
These questions and others can give you a better picture of what kind of work would be best for you. If you find you’re not in the type of position that’s ideal for you, you can see if you can make additional changes in your job’s structure to make it fit better with your needs, or you might think of what jobs might be better suited for you and see if working toward a change in jobs is a good idea for you.
 Do you like to work toward deadlines, or do you like your tasks to come in a relatively steady stream? Do you like to work as part of a team, or independently? Do you like things to be structured and routine, or loose and variable? Do you enjoy being a ‘big fish in a small pond’, or would you like to be a ‘small fish in a big pond’? (Meaning, would you like to be a small part of a large company or a large part of a small company, or something else?) Do you believe in what you do, and is it important to you that you do?",overstress risk job burnout may feel major life overhaul necessary able enjoy job avoid burnout make major change try minor adjustments may help enjoy work give food think whether major change truly necessary nearly impossible good enough job work know requirements unfortunately sometimes difficult know requirements job charge poor communicators boss supervisors vague expectations assign new task little advance notice request new task without provide train inadvertently set workers fail ways prevent things like happen altogether gain clearer view need help situation quite bite assertive communication skills learn speak respectful way help improve work life decrease risk burnout need feel recognize reward job build opportunities recognition reward infrequent may need add reward recognition life may decide take movie home spa experience buy something nice give small nurture reward complete project complete another month hard work also team supportive friend agree listen successes provide support one another get support recognition job things nurture emotionally remind importance work especially work job field reward sparse keep balance lifestyle important work play may find ability work begin wane order maintain balance lifestyle first step take overview current lifestyle see areas balance enough time relationships hobbies sleep self care exercise healthy eat important feature healthy lifestyle addition work responsibilities next step look priorities make change lifestyle reflect better usually change experience current circumstances change attitude develop optimistic point view change negative self talk pattern long way toward help see glass half full well actually make productive less stress assess current state mind make change see things positive light may find much happier life certain feature personality make job better fit others job well suit personality may put unnecessary stress every day work follow good question ask question others give better picture kind work would best find type position ideal see make additional change job structure make fit better need might think job might better suit see work toward change job good idea like work toward deadlines like task come relatively steady stream like work part team independently like things structure routine loose variable enjoy big fish small pond would like small fish big pond mean would like small part large company large part small company something else believe important

While everyone experiences the feeling of being in a rut or cringes at the thought of Mondays, sometimes that feeling can escalate and become much more pervasive. If you're having a few too many of those ""I hate my job"" days, you're not alone. But that doesn't mean that you should accept those feelings of dread that accompany even the thought of going to work. You don't have to stay at a job you hate, and you may not even have to switch jobs to stop working at a job you really can't stand. These steps may help you find greater satisfaction at your current job.
 
First, try gaining a better understanding of what's behind that ""I hate my job"" feeling. Different people find different things they hate about their jobs, but often what people dislike most about their work overlaps with the issues that contribute to job burnout.
 
If you're overqualified, you may feel bored. If the expectations of you are too high, you may feel overwhelmed. Either way, these feelings can create significant stress.
 
People need to feel that they have some control over their lives in general, and this certainly applies to jobs. If you feel you can't control what happens to you at your job, you may find that things feel more stressful. Having even a small sense of control can change how you feel about normal, everyday stressors.
 
Are there heavy consequences if you make a mistake? People often think that working long hours is the big contributor to burnout, but working in a high-pressure environment can really add to the stress.
 
Are you recognized for your achievements? Are you adequately rewarded for your hard work? If not, it generally becomes difficult to stay motivated. We all need to feel that our work matters.
 
Sometimes the best solution is simply to find a new job. But quitting may not be your best option—at least not right away. Whether your goal is to stay at your job long-term or just long enough to find other employment, making an effort to reduce stress and increase your overall satisfaction can go a long way.
 
To enjoy your job, you should be challenged just the right amount—not too much, and not too little. Furthermore, it's best to be challenged in the areas in which you are strong and at which you naturally excel. Talk to your employer about adjusting your responsibilities to match your strengths. Offer to take on new challenges that can help the company—things you naturally enjoy and do well—and see if the areas that are overly stressful might be better managed by someone else who excels in that area.
 
Give some thought to what might make your job better, and see if you can get permission from your manager to tweak your work situation and responsibilities. Keep in mind that while you might not get everything you ask for, the worst they can say is no.
 
If you just can't seem to find anything at work that makes you feel content and fulfilled, look outside the office for some fun and diversion. Sign up to be a volunteer for a cause you believe in, enroll in a course with a friend, or plan some weekend excursions to visit friends you don't normally get to see. Remember: There's more to life than what goes on at your workplace.
 
A mindful morning routine can do wonders for starting your day off on the right foot. Do your best to get a good night's sleep before starting your day with a practice or activity you look forward to. Dedicate some time in your morning just for you. Do you enjoy reading the news after getting out of bed? Would a 10-minute meditation give you peace of mind to start your day? Or maybe listening to a good podcast during your commute would help you walk into the office with less dread.
 
When things get difficult, remind yourself of why you're doing this in the first place. Keep your eyes on the prize and try to remember the rewards you find or used to find in your work. If you're having a difficult time, see if you can add a few extra rewards for yourself—give yourself a treat at the end of the day as a reward for hard work. Rewards can be as simple as treating yourself to a favorite meal to allowing yourself time to do something you enjoy to spending an evening with friends. 
 
Finding the humor in your situation can turn stressors into stress relievers—or at least it can rob them of their stress-inducing power. While quick stress relievers can be an excellent first line of defense against the effects of chronic stress. They can help you turn off your body's stress response and allow you to face your work from a calm and more relaxed place. Maintaining a sense of humor and laughing can help you relieve stress and stay healthier.
 
Laughter reduces the level of stress hormones like cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline), dopamine, and growth hormone and increases the level of health-enhancing hormones, like endorphins. Laughter also increases the number of antibody-producing cells we have working for us and enhances the effectiveness of T cells—all of which makes for a stronger immune system. Laughter also connects people, and social support is good for stress relief. So go to a hilarious movie or a comedy club with friends, check out a humorous TV show, or plan a game night with friends who are practically guaranteed to make you chuckle.
 
If you can relieve general stress, you'll likely feel less overwhelmed by specific stressors at your job. Resolve to find a form of exercise you love, whether it's biking around town with friends or horsing around at the ice skating rink. (No, you don't have to resort to a boring exercise bike at the gym to reap the stress-relieving benefit of exercise!) Learn how to meditate and do so on a regular basis. There are a variety of apps that you can get on your phone that make squeezing in meditation even easier. Learn to practice deep breathing, which you can do right at your desk when you feel like one big stress ball.
 
Be sure you have support in your life. See if you can organize a supportive network of co-workers to commiserate and congratulate each other on the trials and triumphs of the job. Or create a group among your friends outside of work. These groups can work wonders for your mood!
 
Decide in advance if you want these groups to be informational, in which case you will want to host a speaker at each meeting, or simply a forum for sharing experiences.
 
Finally, if you feel overwhelmed and unable to cope, talk to a professional—you don't have to handle an overwhelming situation alone.

Sexual harassment is not just embarrassing and uncomfortable for victims, it can be devastating for them too. In fact, sexual harassment can cause a victim to experience everything from depression﻿﻿ and anxiety to shame, guilt, and self-blame. If you have experienced sexual harassment at work, there are a number of things you can do to heal from the experience. But it is going to take some work.
 
One of the first steps in overcoming sexual harassment is to acknowledge what happened to you and recognize that it was wrong. In fact, sexual harassment is such a serious issue that it is regulated by the law. For instance, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) says that it is against the law to harass a person because of that person’s sex.
 It also is against the law to make unwelcome sexual advances, request sexual favors, touch someone inappropriately, make sexual remarks, engage in sexual bullying, and share sexually-offensive jokes. Basically, anything sexual in nature that creates a hostile work environment is considered sexual harassment. 
What’s more, sexual harassment is not limited to male-to-female abuse even though it is by far the most common form of harassment. Female-to-female sexual harassment, male-to-male sexual harassment, and female-to-male sexual harassment also take place and are against the law.
 
While the law does not usually apply to isolated incidents of teasing or offhand remarks, it becomes harassment when it creates a toxic work environment or when it results in adverse employment conditions such as being fired or reprimanded due to sexual harassment.
 
While every person deals with the trauma of sexual harassment differently, if you have been victimized by sexual harassment, you may start off feeling shocked and then move to denial.﻿﻿ These responses are normal and are usually followed by feelings of victimization, which can lead to low self-esteem.
 
Additionally, your response can be so significant that you may even have trouble functioning from day to day. The key is to address the issue or leave the work environment.
 
It also is not uncommon for victims of sexual harassment to have difficulty sleeping,﻿﻿ getting up in the morning, eating, exercising, or doing anything that they used to consider fun. Other symptoms that sexual harassment can lead to might include headaches, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, stomach issues, and elevated blood pressure.
 
You might also feel betrayed, angry, powerless, hopeless, and out of control. And in extreme cases, victims may experience depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Moving on after being sexually harassed at work can seem like a daunting task. You may feel stuck or hopeless about your situation. But with a little work and some outside counseling, you should be able to make sense of your experience, heal from it, and move on. Here are some steps every victim must take in order to heal from sexual harassment.
 
If you have a friend or family member who is dealing with the aftermath of sexual harassment, you may want to help, but just don't know where to start. Simply being there to listen and be supportive is often all that is required.
 
You do not need to fix things for your friend, nor do you need to offer sage advice. Your most important role is to be patient with what she is going through and support her where you can.﻿﻿ She needs to know that she is safe with you and that you believe her. You also could remind her that the harassment was not her fault. Here is a list of additional tips for when you are interacting with your friend:
 
Remember not to judge her. Try to understand her feelings and offer support. Be there for her when you can and encourage her to talk to others as well.
 
Encourage her to stay connected. The worst thing your friend can do is become isolated or spend a lot of time alone. While it is common for any victim of harassment to withdraw from others, this is not helpful to her healing. Nudge her to stay connected to you and other people.
 
Respect her boundaries, and give her space if she needs it. Remember, her boundaries were violated when she was sexually harassed so she will likely fight pretty hard to develop new ones. Allow her the freedom to do that. Do not smother her with attention or help.
 
Allow her to heal at her own pace. Do not rush her or try to fix things for her. Everyone heals at different rates. Try to be patient if she is taking longer to get over her experience than you think she should.
 
Support her decisions even if you do not agree with them. It is very important that your friend makes her own decisions. She needs the space and the control takes back her life on her terms. While it is fine to make suggestions, do not try to control her or tell her what to do.
 
Dealing with the trauma of sexual harassment is something that should not be put off or ignored. It is important that you explore your underlying feelings and find healthy ways of dealing with these emotions. Too many times people try to numb their feelings with other things like busy work or food.
 
Some will even resort to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain and forget for a period of time. But these are not healthy ways of coping. If you find that you cannot develop good coping skills on your own, be sure to ask your doctor for recommendations for a reputable counselor. Remember, it is not a sign of weakness to get counseling. In fact, it is a sign of wisdom and courage.
 Accept what happened. What this means is to validate your experience. Do not minimize what happened or make excuses for the perpetrator. It is also important to allow yourself to experience your emotions. Do not bottle up the hurt and anger you are feeling. Find healthy ways to express these feelings. Some options include prayer, meditation, yoga,﻿﻿ and other stress-reducing activities. Talk to someone about the harassment. It always helps to talk with a safe person. Try to find someone who will respect your feelings and your perspective. Don't share your thoughts and feelings with someone who is going to tell you that you are overreacting or being emotional. If you do not have anyone to talk with about your experience, consider joining a support group or starting one of your own. Journal about your experience. Describe how sexual harassment affected you. Explore the different emotions you are feeling. Sometimes it is helpful to include in your journal a letter to the person who harassed you. Say all the things you wish you would have said, but didn't. It can be very healing to get all of that out of your system. Journaling also may help you make sense of what happened to you.﻿﻿ And it is a safe place to say whatever is on your mind without trying to filter anything out. Stop blaming yourself. What happened to you was not your fault. You did not cause it and you could not control the other person. Remind yourself too that you have nothing to be ashamed of and you should not feel guilty. Blaming yourself will slow your healing. The only guilty person is the perpetrator. He made a choice to sexually harass you. The only choice you have in the matter is how you are going to deal with what happened to you. Remember, you have complete control over your response and where you go from here. Focus on that fact and let it empower you. Bring closure to your experience. An important part of the healing process is putting the past behind you and detaching from the trauma you experienced. Sometimes this means changing jobs or careers. It also could mean discovering who you really are. Too many times, a person's identity is tied to her work. Instead, rediscover what makes you you. Start a new hobby and develop new interests. And most importantly, do not dwell on what happened to you. Find a healthy way to put the past behind you and try to remain positive about things in your life. Use the experience to help others. Sometimes, you can bring meaning to what happened to you by integrating your experience into your life in some way. For instance, you could write a blog about what you have experienced and offer suggestions to readers. Or, you could lead a support group, build a website for harassment victims, or speak to others. Another option is to volunteer with non-profit groups that address sexual harassment. The key is taking a negative experience and turning it into something positive. Doing so helps build your resiliency. Find a counselor. If you find it difficult to move on after your experience, you may benefit from seeing a counselor who specializes in dealing with workplace sexual harassment. Counselors that specialize in sexual assault or abuse may also be helpful. Additionally, if you have been harassed at work or school, advocates advise not using your school or employer's mental health staff. Sometimes the lines of confidentiality get blurred and the counselor will share your information about you to others in the organization. In extreme cases, they may even try to protect the organization from liability. It is always best to find a counselor outside of where the sexual harassment occurred. Not only is it an added protection for your privacy, but you may find it easier to open up to someone that is not associated with the organization where the harassment occurred.",sexual harassment

Whether you’ve been dumped by your date or you’ve had a rough day at the office, having healthy coping skills can be key to getting through tough times. Coping skills help you tolerate, minimize, and deal with stressful situations in life. Managing your stress well can help you feel better physically and psychologically and it can impact your ability to perform your best.
 
But not all coping skills are created equal. Sometimes, it’s tempting to engage in strategies that will give quick relief but might create bigger problems for you down the road. It’s important to establish healthy coping skills that will help you reduce your emotional distress or rid yourself of the stressful situations you face.
 
When you’re feeling distressed, ask yourself, “Do I need to change my situation or do I need to find a way to better cope with the situation?” Then, you can decide which type of coping strategy will help you best proceed.
 There are two main types of coping skills: problem-based coping and emotion-based coping. 
Problem-based coping is helpful when you need to change your situation, perhaps by removing a stressful thing from your life. For example, if you’re in an unhealthy relationship, your anxiety and sadness might be best resolved by ending the relationship (as opposed to soothing your emotions).
 
Emotion-based coping is helpful when you need to take care of your feelings when you either don’t want to change your situation or when circumstances are out of your control. For example, if you are grieving the loss of a loved one, it’d be important to take care of your feelings in a healthy way (since you can’t change the circumstance).
 
There isn’t always one best way to proceed. Instead, it’s up to you to decide which type of coping skill is likely to work best for you in your particular circumstance.
 
The following are examples of stressful situations and how each approach could be used.
 
You open your email to find your annual performance review. The review states that you are below average in several areas and you’re surprised by this because you thought you were performing well. You feel anxious and frustrated.
 
You have told your teenager he needs to clean his bedroom. But it’s been a week and clothes and trash seem to be piling up. Before heading out the door in the morning, you told him he has to clean his room after school “or else.” You arrive home from work to find him playing videos in his messy room.
 
You’ve been invited to give a presentation in front of a large group. You were so flattered and surprised by the invitation that you agreed to do it. But as the event approaches, your anxiety skyrockets because you hate public speaking.
 
Whether you’re feeling lonely, nervous, sad, or angry, emotion-focused coping skills can help you deal with your feelings in a healthy way. Healthy coping strategies may soothe you, temporarily distract you, or help you tolerate your distress.
 
Sometimes it’s helpful to face your emotions head-on. For example, feeling sad after the death of a loved one can help you honor your loss.
 So while it would be important to use coping skills to help relieve some of your distress, coping strategies shouldn’t be about constantly distracting you from reality. 
Other times, coping skills may help you change your mood. If you’ve had a bad day at work, playing with your kids or watching a funny movie might cheer you up. Or, if you’re angry about something someone said, a healthy coping strategy might help you calm down before you say something you might regret. Here are some examples of healthy emotion-focused coping skills:
 
There are many ways you might decide to tackle a problem head-on and eliminate the source of your stress. In some cases, that may mean changing your behavior or creating a plan that helps you know what action you’re going to take.
 
In other situations, problem-focused coping may involve more drastic measures, like changing jobs or cutting someone out of your life. Here are some examples of healthy problem-focused coping skills:
 
Just because a strategy helps you endure emotional pain, it doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Some coping skills could create bigger problems in your life. Here are some examples of unhealthy coping skills:
 
Coping skills are usually discussed as a reactive strategy—when you feel bad, you do something to cope. But, research shows﻿﻿ that proactive coping strategies can be an effective way to manage the future obstacles you’re likely to face.
 
For example, if you have worked hard to lose weight, proactive coping strategies could help you maintain your weight after your weight loss program has ended. You might plan ahead for circumstances that might derail you—like the holiday season or dinner invitations from friends—to help you cope.
 
You also might plan ahead for how you’re going to cope with emotions that previously caused you to snack—like boredom or loneliness. And you might prepare a mantra that you’ll repeat to yourself when you’re tempted to give in to temptation.
 Proactive coping has been found to be an effective way to help people deal with predictable changes, like a decline in income during retirement. 
However, coping can also be used to help people deal with unexpected life changes, such as a major change in health. A 2014 study﻿﻿ found that individuals who engaged with proactive coping were better able to deal with the changes they encountered after having a stroke.
 
Another study﻿﻿ found that people who engaged in proactive coping were better equipped to manage their type 2 diabetes. Participants who planned ahead and set realistic goals enjoyed better psychological well-being.
 
So, if you are facing a stressful life event or you’ve undergone a major change, try planning ahead. Consider the skills you can use to cope with the challenges you’re likely to face.
 
When you have a toolbox ready to go, you’ll know what to do. And that could help you to feel better equipped to face the challenges ahead.
 
The coping strategies that work for someone else might not work for you. Going for a walk might help your partner calm down. But you might find going for a walk when you’re angry causes you think more about why you’re mad—and it fuels your angry feelings. So you might decide watching a funny video for a few minutes helps you relax.
 It's important to develop your own toolkit of coping skills that you’ll find useful. You may need to experiment with a variety of coping strategies to help you discover which ones work best for you. 
You might find that certain coping strategies work best for specific issues or emotions. For example, engaging in a hobby may be an effective way to unwind after a long day at work. But, going for a walk in nature might be the best approach when you’re feeling sad.
 
When it comes to coping skills, there’s always room for improvement. So, assess what other tools and resources you can use and consider how you might continue to sharpen your skills in the future.
 Problem-focused coping: You go to the boss and talk about what you can do to improve your performance. You develop a clear plan that will help you do better and you start to feel more confident about your ability to succeed. Emotion-focused coping: You spend your lunch break reading a book to distract yourself from catastrophic predictions that you’re going to be fired and become homeless. After work, you exercise and clean the house as a way to help you feel better so you can think about the situation more clearly. Problem-focused coping: You sit your teenager down and tell him that he’s going to be grounded until his room is clean. You take away his electronics and put him on restriction. In the meantime, you shut the door to his room so you don’t have to look at the mess. Emotion-focused coping: You decide to run some bathwater because a hot bath always helps you feel better. You know a bath will help you calm down so you don’t yell at him or overreact. Problem-focused coping: You decide to hire a public speaking coach to help you learn how to write a good speech and how to deliver it confidently. You practice giving your speech in front of a few friends and family members so you will feel better prepared to step on stage. Emotion-focused coping: You tell yourself that you can do this. You practice relaxation exercises whenever you start to panic. And you remind yourself that even if you’re nervous, no one else is even likely to notice. Clean the house (or a closet, drawer, or area) Color Cook a meal Do yoga Draw Drink tea Garden Give yourself a pep talk Go for a walk Engage in a hobby Exercise Listen to music List the things you feel grateful for Look at landscape photos that help you feel relaxed Look at pictures to remind you of the people, places, and things that bring joy Meditate Picture your “happy place” Play a game with your kids Play with a pet Practice breathing exercises Pray Put on lotion that smells good Read a book Reframe the way you are thinking about the problem Squeeze a stress ball Smile Spend time in nature Take a bath Take care of your body in a way that makes you feel good (paint your nails, do your hair, put on a face mask) Think of something funny Use a relaxation app Use aromatherapy Use progressive muscle relaxation Write in a journal Ask for support from a friend or a professional. Create a to-do list. Engage in problem-solving. Establish healthy boundaries (tell your friend you aren’t going to spend time with her if she makes fun of you). Walk away (leave a situation that is causing you stress). Work on managing your time better (for example, turn off the alerts on your phone). Drinking alcohol or using drugs: Substances may temporarily numb your pain, but they won’t resolve your issues. Substances are likely to introduce new problems into your life. Alcohol, for example, is a depressant that can make you feel worse. Using substances also puts you at risk for developing a substance abuse problem and it may create legal issues, financial problems, and a variety of social issues. Overeating: Food is a common coping strategy. But, trying to “stuff your feelings” with food can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food—and weight issues. Sometimes people go to the other extreme and restrict their eating (because it makes them feel more in control) and clearly, that can be just as unhealthy. Sleeping too much: Whether you take a nap when you’re stressed out or you sleep late to avoid facing the day, sleeping offers a temporary escape from your problems. However, when you wake up, the problem will still be there. Venting to others: Talking about your problems so that you can gain support, develop a solution, or see a problem in a different way can be healthy. But studies show﻿﻿ repeatedly venting to people about how bad your situation is or how terrible you feel is more likely to keep you stuck in a place of pain. Overspending: While many people say they enjoy retail therapy as a way to feel better, shopping can become unhealthy. Owning too many possessions can add stress to your life. Also, spending more than you can afford will only backfire in the end and cause more stress. Avoiding things: Even “healthy” coping strategies can become unhealthy if you’re using them to avoid the problem. For example, if you are stressed about your financial situation, you might be tempted to spend time with friends or watch TV because that’s less anxiety-provoking than creating a budget. But if you never resolve your financial issues, your coping strategies are only masking the problem. ",whether dump date rough day office healthy cop skills key get tough time cop skills help tolerate

There’s stress eating and then there’s eating to reduce stress. Here are eight healthy foods that could help fight stress. And since stress and weight gain are intertwined, these foods may also help you lose weight!
 
These veggies do a body good! Leafy greens contain folate, a vitamin that helps produce the feel-good brain chemicals serotonin and dopamine. When stress levels are high, you want these chemicals flowin’! Try some Swiss chard sautéed with olive oil and garlic. It’s one of my 5 superfoods to shake up your diet! Other foods high in folate: asparagus, broccoli, citrus fruit, Brussels sprouts, and garbanzo beans (a.k.a. chickpeas). Yum!
 
You’re getting very sleepy… and relaxed, thanks to the amino acid tryptophan found in turkey. It eventually converts to serotonin. And serotonin means good feels. Pair it with some complex carbs to get the full benefit.
 
This fish is a total superstar when it comes to nutrition! When we get frazzled, our bodies produce cortisol, a hormone that has been linked to extra belly fat, among other unfavorable responses. The omega-3s in salmon reduce anxiety and depression by combating that cortisol. Salmon also contains vitamin D, which has been shown to help with depression. Oh, and it helps you burn fat. Can't beat that!
 
Full of antioxidants, blueberries should definitely be part of your diet. They help produce dopamine, that stress-fighting chemical! And they’re delicious. Eat them plain, on top of your yogurt, or stirred into oatmeal. And for a go-anywhere snack, try freeze-dried blueberries!
 
Speaking of oatmeal, it's another serotonin supplier. This complex carb will soothe your mood. If you're not a fan of hot oatmeal, try overnight oats. Aside from the serotonin boost, making breakfast the night before could reduce your stress in the morning!
 
To B, or not to B? That is the question. It’s also the answer to why avocados are great for stress relief. Studies have found that feelings of anxiety may be rooted in a vitamin B deficiency. Avocados contain vitamin B, so avo' it up! This tasty treat (fun fact: it's a fruit!) is a fantastic substitute for mayo on your sandwiches. And obviously, it's essential for guacamole!
 Avocado is a great source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which can benefit weight loss. 
These versatile 'lil guys are helpful at busting stress. Flax and chia are seeds with the highest amount of healthy omega-3s, so stock up on ‘em. They make great salad toppers, soup toppers, yogurt toppers… they're TOP notch! Here are some other tasty ways to enjoy chia seeds.
 
Just the thought of sipping a mug of hot tea sounds calming, doesn’t it? Schedule in some tea time: chamomile, green tea, and black tea all work, so pick your favorite. Studies have shown chamomile tea aids in lessening anxiety symptoms. Similarly, a Japanese study found that drinking five cups of green tea each day could reduce stress by 20 percent. If you’re someone who gets frazzled after having caffeine, keep that in mind, and go for decaf!

A little stress can keep us on our toes, motivate us to do our best and challenge us in ways that make us stronger. More than a little stress can actually lead to more negative consequences if we’re not careful: chronic stress, which can adversely affect physical and emotional health, and even self-perpetuating cycles that lead to more and more stress. These negative stress cycles can ultimately put us at risk of experiencing feelings of anxiety, depression, and burnout. This process is a downward spiral of stress, and recognizing when you are moving in that direction can be an important part of moving away from the pattern.
 
It is important to realize when stress is beginning to take on a life of its own and know how to stop the process from accelerating. It is even more valuable to know how to turn these negative patterns into positive ones—patterns that can actually make us stronger, more resilient, and less stressed. Here are some ways to take yourself from a place of feeling stressed and overwhelmed to being in a place of empowerment and peace. Here are some strategies to consider.
 
One of the most significant ways that we keep ourselves stressed or even turn relatively small stressors into larger challenges is the human tendency toward rumination. We can all be prone to rumination from time to time—this is the tendency to play and replay frustrating conversations in our heads, go over and over the details of a stressful event in our near or even distant past, and otherwise revisit stressful situations without actually changing anything for the better. 
 The problem with rumination is that it keeps us in a negative headspace and robs us of our mental peace in the present, without bringing any real payoff in return. 
When you find yourself in the throes of rumination, distracting yourself by shifting your attention to the present moment, even practicing mindfulness, can offer an effective antidote. Listening to music can get you into a more positive place as well. Distracting yourself by getting involved in anything more positive can also do the trick.
 
However, if you find your mind still fighting you and moving toward thoughts of the past, you can instead turn your mind to positive memories. This uses the same process—your memory—and instead focuses it on something that will bring you happiness and positivity rather than stress and frustration. And positivity doesn’t simply move you away from a bad mood or get you into a better one, it can literally build resilience toward stress as well.
 
If you are generally feeling stressed or are stressed because of tedious aspects of your day such as traffic or waiting in long lines, you may find yourself becoming increasingly drained or tense as a result. This may not be an obvious downward spiral, but it is a common way that stress can gain momentum, moving you from a relatively neutral experience into a negative mood. If you are feeling particularly stressed already, these experiences—especially if they are threatening to make you late for your next commitment—can be quite stressful and can put you into a full-blown bad day.
 
As you move through your day, you can find these mildly stressful “waiting times” and use them as opportunities for stress relief by utilizing them for the practice of mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercise. Research shows that focusing on the present moment for even a few minutes—the practice of mindfulness—can help you to relieve stress in the present moment as well as in the future. In this way, you are really using the mildly frustrating times in your day to your advantage. With practice, you can find yourself even looking forward to slow traffic, long lines, daily chores, and other seeming time wasters.
 
Another way that you can reverse the negative momentum of common daily stressors is by changing the way you think about them. If you find yourself becoming stressed by setbacks, a series of minor setbacks can conspire to put you in a stressed frame of mind, and that can lead into a negative pattern of seeing more of the negative than the positive in everything that follows.
 
One way that you can reverse this trend is by simply becoming more aware of it, and realizing that you have a choice. You may not have a choice in the specific circumstances of your day—you can’t always choose what crises drop into your lap or what fires need to be put out—but you can choose how you interpret them, to a great extent. By taking your next frustrating situation and actively looking for the benefits that you’ll gain from it, you can reframe it into something more positive. In this way, at least in your mind, you can turn a “bad day” into a “good day,” or a “crisis” into an “opportunity.” Here are some specific ways that you can reframe a stressful situation and reverse what would have been a downward cycle of stress in the process.
 
Similarly, if you find yourself facing a series of unexpected challenges in your day, you may begin to see most of what happens unexpectedly as a negative rather than as a potential positive. If you automatically see the worst in most of what presents itself to you, you will likely begin to react from a place of negativity and literally create stress and frustration where it doesn’t need to be. You can spread this negative bias to others, and it can take on a life of its own.
 
If this sounds familiar, you can purposely change the way you talk to yourself and the way you interpret what happens to you as it’s happening. Rather than expecting bad things to happen and seeing things as mostly negative, you can stop and actively try to expect the best. As you find yourself thinking negative thoughts about what could go wrong, start to think about what can go right. See everything as an opportunity, and then find out what the opportunity is; become determined to find the silver lining in each dark cloud. This is somewhat distinct from mere reframing because you are actively looking for ways to use what is happening in your life to your advantage rather than simply thinking about it in more positive terms. This is easier said than done, but the results are more powerful than they may seem at first, too.
 
It’s not always possible to cut out every stressor that comes into your life, but there are usually several things that create daily frustration that you could get rid of if you really thought about it. These little stressors, known as “tolerations,” are minor energy drains (or sometimes major energy drains) that can take the form of a toxic friend, a cluttered home where things are frequently lost, or an inefficient routine. They are things we tolerate out of habit, but wouldn’t choose if we thought about it. Cutting these things out of your life can have a distinctly positive effect on your stress levels.
 
Beyond simply eliminating tolerations, however, you can take things a step further to relieve stress in your day. You can replace tolerations with “pleasures,” or things in life that get you into a better mood and give you a little boost of resilience against stress. For example, rather than avoiding a friend that drains you, you can make a concerted effort to spend that same time with a different friend who nurtures and uplifts you. Instead of simply cleaning your cluttered space, you can add little decorative touches that bring you joy or stress relief, such as aromatherapy or a sound system that plays music you love. You get the idea—replace your tolerations with things that actually make your day better, and you’ll reverse your downward stress spiral into an upward spiral of positivity.

If you are wondering if you are a highly sensitive person, it is quite possible that you actually are. This fact might be affecting your relationship with stress in your life. People who are considered ""highly sensitive people"" tend to feel things more deeply than others, detect life's subtleties more easily, and be more reactive to stimuli both internal and external.﻿﻿ They are people who may be more bothered by an itchy shirt or an abrasive friend. They are also people who will notice when someone needs a hug or detect when something bad is about to happen and change course.
 
Unfortunately, this heightened sensitivity and awareness can translate into vigilance, rumination, and extra stress at times. Here is how to cope with the additional and unique stress of being a highly sensitive person, whether the sensitive person is you or someone you care about.
 
When we speak of ""boundaries,"" we mean boundaries in your relationships, but we also mean it in other ways as well. This means becoming more comfortable letting people know where you stand and what you need—classic boundary-setting techniques. But we also mean things like creating some extra wiggle room in your schedule so you don't feel stressed when things inevitably go wrong, pile on, or require an extra response from you.
 
These practices are closely related to the idea of setting boundaries. That's because this involves creating a perimeter around your experiences in life and your thoughts and feelings about them through the practices of meditation and mindfulness.
 
When you practice meditation, you learn to step back and observe your thoughts and feelings, and even your physical reactions as separate from your life and your ""self.""﻿﻿ With practice, a few important things happen. You learn to calm your body more quickly, reversing your stress response and returning to a place of calmness. You also learn to detach from things emotionally more easily so if things feel overwhelming, you don't get swept away in the flood of emotion as easily. It helps you to stay grounded, It can also help you to build resilience to stress. All of this should make it worth the effort for anyone, but this is particularly true for the highly sensitive person.
 
This can mean having your home be soothing and relatively free of conflict. This can be done by adding a few elements known to relieve stress, such as soothing music and aromatherapy,﻿﻿ and having ""down time"" there on a regular basis.
 
This can also mean that you keep your close relationships as conflict-free as possible. This can be accomplished by learning conflict-resolution techniques and assertiveness, both of which can provide you with the tools you need to work through difficulties that may arise between you and your loved ones.
 
Ultimately, it also means that you can choose people in your life to be part of your inner circle after they have proved themselves worthy of it, and you can put distance between yourself and those who drain you, frustrate you, or devalue you. When you have a supportive circle of people who will listen and care when you have a problem to deal with in your life, it can be even more soothing to you if you are sensitive; sensitive people need to feel understood and supported a little more than others, and they are wonderful in their capacity to offer this back as well. But it is important to save your supportiveness for those who will return it, at least in part, rather than those who will drain you and desert you, or inspire self-doubt.
 
As a highly sensitive person, you are probably more susceptible to the ravages of sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, and burnout. This means you need to be sure to get enough sleep at night﻿﻿ (or supplement with naps when necessary), eat healthy meals, and take care of your body, mind, and spirit in whatever ways you can. This will leave you more able to handle whatever comes your way.
 
Highly sensitive people all have their unique challenges. It helps to know what stresses you the most so you can avoid these things in your life. Pay attention to how you feel throughout the day, and even maintain a stress journal if necessary.﻿﻿ Be proactive in adding resilience-building practices as well as eliminating stressors whenever possible. 
 
You may not be able to change the fact that you are sensitive, but you can absolutely change your lifestyle and habits so that you're less affected by those stressors you can't control. After a while, this will become second nature and you will feel more resilient toward stress in general. Then you can simply enjoy the benefits that come with being sensitive.

Failing to manage your anger can lead to a variety of problems like saying things you regret, yelling at your kids, threatening your co-workers, sending rash emails, developing health problems, or even resorting to physical violence. But not all anger issues are that serious. Instead, your anger might involve wasting time thinking about upsetting events, getting frustrated in traffic, or venting about work.
 
Managing your anger doesn't mean never getting angry. Instead, it involves learning how to recognize, cope with, and express your anger in healthy and productive ways. Anger management is a skill that everyone can learn. Even if you think you have your anger under control, there’s always room for improvement.
 Since unchecked anger can often lead to aggressive behavior, anger management uses various techniques to help a person cope with thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a healthy and more productive way. 
Anger is an emotion that can range from mild irritation to intense rage. While many people categorize anger as a solely “negative emotion,” it can be positive. Angry feelings may spur you to stand up for someone or they may lead you to create social change.
 
But when left unchecked, angry feelings can lead to aggressive behavior, like yelling at someone or damaging property. Angry feelings also may cause you to withdraw from the world and turn your anger inward, which can impact your health and well-being.
 
Anger becomes problematic when it's felt too often or too intensely or when it's expressed in unhealthy ways, which can take a toll physically, mentally, and socially. For this reason, anger management strategies can be beneficial and can help you discover healthy ways to express your feelings.
 
Research consistently shows that cognitive behavioral interventions are effective for improving anger management.﻿﻿ These interventions involve changing the way you think and behave. They are based on the notion that your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected.
 
Your thoughts and behaviors can either fuel your emotions or they can reduce them. So, if you want to shift your emotional state away from anger, you can change what you’re thinking and what you’re doing.﻿﻿ Without fuel, the fire inside you will begin to dwindle and you'll feel calmer.
 The best way to manage your anger is to create an anger management control plan. Then, you'll know what to do when you start feeling upset. 
The following are 11 strategies that you may want to include in your anger management plan. These tools are designed to help you manage and control your anger.
 
If you’ve gotten into the habit of losing your temper, take stock of the things that trigger your anger. Long lines, traffic jams, snarky comments, or excessive tiredness are just a few things that might shorten your fuse.
 
While you shouldn't blame people or external circumstances for your inability to keep your cool, understanding the things that trigger your anger can help you plan accordingly.
 
You might decide to structure your day differently to help you manage your stress better. Or, you might practice some anger management techniques before you encounter circumstances that you usually find distressing. Doing these things can help you lengthen your fuse—meaning that a single frustrating episode won’t set you off.
 
Before you spring into action to calm yourself down, ask yourself if your anger is a friend or an enemy. If you’re witnessing someone’s rights being violated or you are in an unhealthy situation, your anger might be helpful.
 
In these cases, you might proceed by changing the situation rather than changing your emotional state. Sometimes, your anger is a warning sign that something else needs to change—like an emotionally abusive relationship or a toxic friendship.
 Being angry might give you the courage you need to take a stand or make a change. 
If, however, your anger is causing distress or hurting your relationships, your anger may be an enemy. Other signs of this type of anger include feeling out of control and regretting your words or actions later. In these situations, it makes sense to work on tackling your emotions and calming yourself down.
 
If you're like some people, you may feel like your anger hits you in an instant. Perhaps you go from calm to furious in a heartbeat. But there are still likely warning signs when your anger is on the rise. Recognizing them early can help you take action to prevent your anger from reaching a boiling point.
 
Think about the physical warning signs of anger that you experience. Perhaps your heart beats faster or your face feels hot. Or, maybe you begin to clench your fists. You also might notice some cognitive changes. Perhaps your mind races or you begin “seeing red.”
 
By recognizing your warning signs, you have the opportunity to take immediate action and prevent yourself from doing or saying things that create bigger problems. Learn to pay attention to how you're feeling and you'll get better at recognizing the warning signs.
 
Trying to win an argument or sticking it out in an unhealthy situation will only fuel your anger. One of the best things you can do when your anger is rising is to remove yourself from the situation if you can.
 
When a conversation gets heated, take a break. Leave a meeting if you think you’re going to explode. Go for a walk if your kids upset you. A time-out can be key to helping you calm your brain and your body.
 If there’s someone that you routinely get into heated disputes with, like a friend or family member, talk with them about the importance of taking a time-out and resuming when you're both feeling calm. 
When you need to step away, explain that you aren’t trying to dodge difficult subjects, but that you’re working on managing your anger. You aren't able to have a productive conversation or resolve conflict when you’re feeling really upset. You can rejoin the discussion or address the issue again when you're feeling calmer.
 
Sometimes it helps to set a specific time and place when you can discuss the issue again. Doing so gives your friend, colleague, or family member a sense of peace that the issue will indeed be discussed—just at a later time.
 
If there’s someone who has a calming effect on you, talking through an issue or expressing your feelings to that person may be helpful. It’s important to note, however, that venting can backfire.
 
Complaining about your boss, describing all the reasons you don’t like someone, or grumbling about all of your perceived injustices may add fuel to the fire. A common misconception is that you have to vent your anger to feel better.
 
But studies show you don’t need to “get your anger out.”﻿﻿ Smashing things when you’re upset, for example, may actually make you angrier. So it’s important to use this coping skill with caution.
 
Likewise, if you’re going to talk to a friend, make sure you’re working on developing a solution or reducing your anger, not just venting. It's unfair to use them as your go-to sounding board. Instead, you might find that the best way to use this strategy is to talk about something other than the situation causing you to feel angry.
 
Anger gives you a rush of energy. One of the best ways to put that surge to good use is to engage in physical activity.﻿﻿ Whether you go for a brisk walk or hit the gym, working out can burn off extra tension.
 
Regular exercise also helps you decompress. Aerobic activity reduces stress, which might help improve your frustration tolerance.﻿﻿ Additionally, exercise allows you to clear your mind. You may find that after a long run or a hard workout you have a clearer perspective on what was troubling you.
 
Angry thoughts add fuel to your anger. Thinking things like, “I can’t stand it. This traffic jam is going to ruin everything,” will increase your frustration. When you find yourself thinking about things that fuel your anger, reframe your thoughts.
 
Instead, think about the facts by saying something like, “There are millions of cars on the road every day. Sometimes, there will be traffic jams.” Focusing on the facts—without adding in catastrophic predictions or distorted exaggerations—can help you stay calmer.﻿﻿
 
You also might develop a mantra that you can repeat to drown out the thoughts that fuel your anger. Saying, ""I'm OK. Stay calm,"" or ""Not helpful,"" over and over again can help you minimize or reduce angry thoughts.
 
Ruminating about an upsetting situation fuels angry feelings. If, for example, you’ve had a bad day at work, rehashing everything that went wrong all evening will keep you stuck in a state of frustration.
 The best way to calm down might be to change the channel in your brain and focus on something else altogether. 
Telling yourself “Don’t think about that,” isn’t always successful. The best way to mentally shift gears is to distract yourself with an activity. Do something that requires your focus and makes it more challenging for angry or negative thoughts to creep in.
 
Some examples might include deep-cleaning the kitchen, weeding the garden, paying some bills, or playing with the kids. Find something to do that will keep your mind occupied enough that you won’t ruminate on the things upsetting you. Then, your body and your brain can calm down.
 
There are many different relaxation exercises you can utilize to reduce anger. The key is to find the one that works best for you. Breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation are two common strategies for reducing tension.﻿﻿
 
The best part is, both exercises can be performed quickly and discreetly. So whether you’re frustrated at work or you’re angry at a dinner engagement, you can let go of stress quickly and immediately.
 
It’s important to note, however, that relaxation exercises take practice. At first, you might not feel as though they’re effective, or you might question whether they’re going to work for you. But with practice, they can become your go-to strategies for anger management.
 
Sometimes it helps to take a moment and think about what emotions might be lurking beneath your anger. Anger often serves as a protective mask to help you avoid feeling more painful emotions, like embarrassment, sadness, and disappointment.
 
When someone gives you feedback that’s hard to hear, for example, you might lash out in anger because you’re embarrassed. Convincing yourself the other person is bad for criticizing you might make you feel better in the moment because it keeps your embarrassment at bay. But acknowledging underlying emotions can help you get to the root of the problem. Then, you can decide to take appropriate action.
 
For instance, if someone cancels plans on you and your underlying emotion is disappointment, you could try explaining how the cancellation makes you feel rather than lashing out in anger. When you're honest about your feelings, you're more likely to resolve the issue. Responding in anger usually doesn't accomplish anything except pushing people away.
 
If you tend to come home from work stressed and take out your anger on your family, or you know that workplace meetings cause you a lot of frustration, create a calm down kit that you can use to relax.
 
Think about objects that help engage all your senses. When you can look, hear, see, smell, and touch calming things, you can change your emotional state. So a calm down kit might include scented hand lotion, a picture of a serene landscape, a spiritual passage you can read aloud, and a few pieces of your favorite candy. Include things that you know will help you remain calm.
 
You also might create a virtual calm down kit that you can take everywhere. These are things that you can call upon when needed and are more portable. For instance, calming music and images, guided meditation, or instructions for breathing exercises could be stored in a special folder on your smartphone.
 
If anger has been causing problems in your life and you’re struggling to tame your temper on your own, you might want to seek professional help. Some mental health problems can be linked to anger management issues.
 
For example, PTSD has been linked to aggressive outbursts. Depressive disorders also can cause irritability and may make it more difficult to manage anger. It's important to uncover any mental health issues that could hinder your ability to manage anger.
 
Start by talking to your physician about your mood and your behavior. Your physician will make sure you don’t have any physical health issues that are contributing to the problem.
 
Your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation. Depending on your goals and treatment needs, therapy may involve individual sessions as well as anger management classes.
 You also can contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
For many people, angry outbursts serve a purpose. Yelling at someone may get them to comply with your demands. But while aggressive behavior may get your needs met in the short term, there are long-term consequences. Your words might cause lasting damage to the relationship or even lead to its demise.
 
If you’ve been using your anger as a tool, you may benefit from learning healthier strategies, such as asking for help or speaking up in an assertive, but not aggressive, manner. Talk to your doctor about your anger management issues if you need more assistance.

"
For decades, we’ve known that ""positive thinking” can combat stress and negativity by helping us focus on what is working, by helping us to maintain a less dire view of what we are facing, and by enabling us to put things in perspective, among other things. Researchers and psychologists have broadened our understanding of how positive thinking can backfire if we are trying to force ourselves to deny feelings that we have, ignore potential dangers in a situation we face, or act in a way that feels false. This has led to a focus on positive thinking with a focus on authenticity, which works well for stress relief.
 
Another way that positive thinking works are less obvious, but perhaps even more powerful. Researcher Barbara Fredrickson has studied the general effects of positivity and found that there is a point at which our positive moods and mental states can lead us to a place where we are more creative, motivated, and resilient to stress. When we reach this tipping point, our perspective is more broad in general: we see opportunities we may have missed, and we believe we can make them work for us. We also see more beauty in the world and have more appreciation for it. Our ability to manage stress in general increases, so we are less likely to fall into a downward spiral of reactivity.
 
Generally speaking, once we reach a point where we are experiencing positive feelings significantly more often than we are entrenched in negative ones, this self-perpetuating cycle of positivity is set in motion, and positivity and resilience become much more easy to attain and maintain.
 
More specifically, when our moods are positive three times more than they are negative, or if our positive-to-negative ratio is three-to-one, we reach a tipping point where we experience an “upward spiral” of positivity and everything appears to fall into place for our moods and performance.
 
By focusing on creating a 3:1 ratio for yourself, you can build positive experiences into your life. These are rewarding in themselves, but they can provide so much more for you as well.
 By cultivating positive moments that make you feel optimistic, grateful, appreciated, inspired, awe-struck, and just plain happy, you can build your ability to enjoy life in general and seek out even more of these positive experiences. 
If you are knowledgeable in math, you probably already realize that there are two main ways that you can raise your positivity ratio: you can minimize your negative experiences (decrease your denominator) and you can increase your positive ones (increase your numerator). When we talk about negative and positive experiences, this means those that create these feelings within you. Many experiences can be felt as either negative or positive depending on a multitude of personal factors. This means that sometimes it is possible to shift a “negative” experience to being felt as a “positive” one if you know how.
 
Shifting your perspective to more positive thinking can be a powerful approach to increasing your positivity, and it can work in several ways. Finding the positive in a situation, attaching personal meaning, and reframing a threat as a challenge are all strategies that have been proven effective. However, as mentioned earlier, it is important to know that denying your legitimate negative feelings or trying to convince yourself that something is positive when you truly aren't feeling it can backfire and can paradoxically make you feel more stressed than less.
 
One reason this occurs is that you may feel that you ""should"" experience things in a more positive way and the fact that you aren't is a failure on your part. Another reason that attempting to force yourself to feel positivity when you strongly feel negativity is that it can feel inauthentic; our emotions are often there for important reasons, so ignoring your intuition or emotions when it is important and your feelings are trying to tell you something can create psychological dissonance. Sometimes addressing the issue that is causing stress is a more effective approach.
 
When working on feeling positivity, it is important to focus on positive aspects of a situation that you truly feel are positive, rather than attempting to convince yourself that you really feel differently about something that has you feeling rightly upset. This is a fine line to walk.
 
Many people have found that the “positivity ratio” approach to stress management feels very empowering. This is because it provides us with a sense of control, and when we feel in control of our situation, we feel less stressed. We can’t always control our circumstances, but we can control how we respond to them. When we feel that we have options and resources, we can respond from a place of strength and inner peace. We have much more control over adding pleasant experiences in our lives than we often have over preventing stressful ones. With that in mind, here are some simple ways to raise your positivity ratios.
 
Make a plan. When you’re feeling stressed or slightly depressed, you may not be starting off the day feeling excited about what’s ahead like you might if you were feeling better about things. In fact, you may be seeing things in a more negative light and making decisions that create more of the same—something that is known as a downward spiral of negativity. It is often possible to turn things around with a simple plan.
 
The act of creating a plan can empower you to feel more control over your circumstances and relax into your day with more positive expectations. The plan itself can involve minimizing stressors (lowering your numerator) or increasing the amount of time you spend feeling positive feelings. By planning ahead, you can consider canceling plans that can create more stress, or add positive experiences to your day.
 
Maintain a gratitude journal. One way to raise your ratios is to maximize the positive experiences you already have in your life. You can expand the positive feelings you experience by savoring them. You can also increase your focus on what makes you happy by journaling about the things for which you are grateful.
 
When you regularly start or end the day by writing about three things you appreciate that day, you develop a habit of focusing on things that bring joy and lift your mood. You also make gratitude more of an automatic experience. An added bonus of having a gratitude journal is that you are left with a written record of the many things you have to appreciate in life. Studies show that gratitude journaling can bring lasting benefits to your mood and personal resilience.
 
Monitor your mood. When you become stressed repeatedly and your ratios start to shift, you may not notice a downturn in the mood until you are feeling significant effects of a lower-than-three-to-one ratio. This may seem to go without saying, but paying attention to your mood is important for your long-term happiness and resilience. If you notice that you’ve felt stressed for a few days and you are starting to experience the tell-tale signs of a lower ratio, you can begin turning things around for yourself right away. This can keep things from moving in the wrong direction before raising your ratio becomes difficult.
 
Treat yourself. Researchers in positive psychology have identified certain activities or experiences that are physically or emotionally pleasing as “pleasures.” They provide an immediate lift to your mood, and require little effort, like eating a cookie, enjoying a bath, or savoring a good song. Pleasures can be effective in lifting your positivity ratio, and they’re easy to add to your life. It’s important to know that pleasures usually provide a slightly decreasing level of positive experience if you use them a lot, so varying them is optimal—don’t use the same pleasures every day unless they do truly still bring you the same bit of joy. Changing up your pleasures—keeping them in rotation—is the best way to go, and still a simple and effective way to make the most of your day.
 
Have some habits: While positive thinking is difficult to maintain day in and day out, habits that bring an emotional lift are simpler to stick with. This is because it’s often easier to change our behaviors than our thoughts. By adding some habits into your day that will create an emotional lift, such as a morning workout, a daily nature walk, or a call to a good friend during your commute home, you can add positive experiences to your day and greater levels of positivity to your habitual way of thinking. The habit of positive thinking can follow from there.
 
Find some surprises. We can grow used to even the most positive experiences and take them for granted without realizing it. For this reason, it helps to have some variety in your day. In the morning while you're planning your day, try to add something new that you'll enjoy, something that isn't part of your routine. Having a fresh experience will maximize the joy you find in it.
 
Use proven standbys. It also helps to be aware of what truly brings you comfort and contentment, and work these things into your regular routine. If you enjoy walking the same route when you exercise, watching the same comedies at night, or eating the same favorite meals, be sure to work what you love into your daily life as much as possible. You can make the 3-to-1 ratio a regular aspect of your life.

"
A bullet journal is something of a mix of a daily planner, to-do list, and diary. The bullet journal is an analog journaling system created by New York-based designer Ryder Carroll. He describes this planner/journaling approach as a method to ""help you track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future.""
 
So what makes bullet journals so appealing? This type of personal journal allows people to record achievements, goals, thoughts, inspiration, and reflections in an organized and creative way. Users can make entries of daily, weekly, and monthly progress toward their goals. This can be an effective system when trying to change a habit, reach a goal, or make some sort of life change.
 
The bullet journal system is fairly complex. Each component of the journal is broken down into a series of modules:
 
Plus, the beginning of the journal contains a detailed index that allows you to quickly keep track of what’s in your journal and where to find it. This index is usually fairly complicated and utilizes symbols and notes to help keep everything organized.
 
The system also relies on different bullet symbols that help you quickly see what you have on your plate each day. A note (any type of fact or observation), would get a dash. A task (i.e. “get milk from the grocery store”) would be noted with a dot. An event (i.e., “Birthday party tonight”) is marked by an open circle.
 
Such a system can be appealing to those who enjoy such structure and organization. However, such complexity can be daunting and make it less likely that people actually stuck with the system.
 The great thing about the bullet journal approach is that it is highly adaptable—you can personalize your bullet journal to meet you specific needs, keeping it as simple or as complex as you desire. 
You might opt to focus on specific health and fitness goals such as losing weight or working out. Or you might track your daily moods in order to look for patterns that influence your behaviors. You might even focus on academic, athletic, career, or personal development goals.
 
So why would you want to use a bullet journal approach when there are so many other planning and journaling tools out there, many of which tend to be a bit more high-tech?
 
The reality is that no single approach is going to work for everyone, but the bullet journal does present a few key psychological advantages that are worth considering.
 
This approach takes time to master, but it may end up saving you time in the long-run.
 
The first thing to consider is that any type of reminder tool is going to be helpful in some way. Attention is a limited resource. If you are using up valuable mental real-estate keeping track of mundane daily tasks, you're less likely to be able to apply those resources to other tasks.
 Getting things out of your head and tracking them somewhere in a systematic way can help you stay on track while freeing you up to focus on more important things. 
Bullet journaling can often be faster and easier than other organizational tools.
 
While the system can appear quite complex to the novice, experienced bullet journal users suggest it becomes much simpler once you get the hang of it. And if you are currently relying on many different tools, calendars, and planners to stay organized, a bullet journal may actually be much simpler.
 
The bullet journal system also helps combine multiple different organizational tools into one easy-to-use resource. Rather than covering your desk with colorful sticky notes, keeping track of appointments in your online calendar, and setting daily reminders on your mobile device, all of these things are combined into one organized tour.
 
Every time you look in your bullet journal to see something like your daily reminders or grocery shopping list, it is also likely that you will look at other things in your journal such as reminders about your long-term goals.
 
Visual Advantages
 
The bullet journal format allows you to easily track things in a highly visual and organized format. These journals also allow you to explore your creative side. Doodling, sketching, color-coded notes, mind maps, and other brainstorming activities can all be incorporated into your personalized journal.
 
Doodling can be more than just a way to illustrate your journal—it may also improve your memory. In one study, researchers found that drawing items on a list enhanced memory of those items better than just writing them down.
 
Writing Things Down Has Many Benefits
 
The simple act of writing things down can often make it seem more manageable. One major benefit they offer is getting your plans out of your head and committing them to paper. This process of externalizing and expressing your thoughts on paper can make your goals more concrete and doable. It can also make tackling your to-do list less intimidating.
 Keeping a list of projects running through your mind can be stressful, but listing it all out on paper can give you a step-by-step process that immediately seems much easier to tackle. 
Tracking things visually can make it easier to make connections between emotions and behaviors. This is particularly helpful if you are trying to achieve a health-related goal such as losing weight or quitting smoking. When you can see the certain emotions, situations, or settings are more likely to lead to problematic actions, you can make more of an effort to avoid these triggers in the future.
 
The act of writing things down has been shown to have a number of psychological benefits too, including improving memory, boosting learning, and decreasing distractibility.
 
Keeping track of your progress and achievements can provide a sense of accomplishment
 
Some people find standard to-do lists highly motivating. Having a clearly defined set of goals that you can check off as you complete each one can be a source of inspiration for some. Yet others may find such lists daunting. Rather than focusing on what they did get done, some people fixate on what remains unfinished. Or they might feel so overwhelmed by the number of items on their list that just getting started seems impossible.
 
Because of the highly personalized nature of a bullet journal, you can rely on a tracking method that works for you. If you find to-do lists effective motivators, then you should, by all means, incorporate them into your journal. If such lists are demotivating, consider using a ""done"" list to note what you have accomplished. Such lists can be less daunting and provide a sense of achievement.
 
Writing down things that are troubling you can be a great way to get things out of your system. However, it is important to draw a line between venting and excessive rumination. Setting aside a section of your bullet journal for ""rants and raves"" can be a good way to get things off your chest without delving into obsessing about the things that irritate you.
 
All you really need to get started is a blank notebook or journal and a pen.
 
You can make any customization you choose beyond that. Any blank journal, sketchbook, or notepad will work. You might choose to use just a simple notebook filled with lined paper or invest in a higher-quality journal with heavyweight pages that are perfect for writing, sketching, doodling, or whatever else you choose to include in your journal.
 
You might also choose to invest in high-quality pens, decorative stamps, washi tape, markers, and stickers that you can use to decorate, organize, categorize, and individualize your journal pages. Don't spend too much money before you're sure this journaling method works for you, though!
 
The contents of your journal are really up to you. Some of the modules you might want to incorporate include:
 
If you need more ideas about what to include in your bullet journal, try a quick search online to find lots of inspirational examples. You might want to make a quick list of the type of things you would like to keep track of so you can have an idea of what pages you will create as you get started.
 
Bullet journals have become popular for good reason—they can be a fun, useful, and effective way to organize, plan, and track your goals, projects, and to-dos. Perhaps the greatest advantage of a bullet journal is that there is no need to invest in expensive resources. With a cheap notebook, a pen, and some creativity, you can develop a rewarding planner that can help you track your progress and work toward your goals.
 A future log where you record your plans and aspirations for the future A monthly calendar that helps you track shorter-term goals, to-dos, and deadlines A daily log for keeping track of daily tasks, appointments, and immediate deadlines An index: This page acts as a table of contents and should include a listing of page titles with associated page numbers for any specific page you might want to find later. A future log: To list your long-term goals, from smaller goals to even the loftiest of dreams. A monthly log: A monthly calendar where you can list important deadlines, events, and other reminders. A daily log: A day to day list of to-dos and reminders. Lists and Collections: Individual pages devoted to lists of things that are important to you. For example, you might want to track items that you are collecting, bills that you owe, gifts you need to purchase for holidays, books that you want to read, or any other type of list that you might

Social comparison is a common human dynamic that first rears its head when children are very small, in the days of toddlers wanting whatever toy is in the hands of the kid next to them. It gains momentum in elementary school when kids follow fads, and it’s noticed when someone isn’t watching the same shows or playing the same games as everyone else.
 
High school, the world of brand names, popular music, cliques and “fear of missing out” is when social comparison really takes hold, and it never quite goes away as people focus on getting into the better colleges, landing the better jobs, marrying someone their friends might envy, and building a picture-perfect life with them. Once we have kids, we rejoin the cycle through them.
 
As adults, we face many of the same social comparison pressures as teens to one degree or another: comparing our looks, our social status, our material items, even our relationships.
 Comparing ourselves to each other is a natural human behavior that has evolved to help us live together as a cohesive group, to help us learn from one another, and to keep us from falling too far behind our potential. 
It also helps us to define ourselves, to gauge how we’re doing in various areas of life based on what appears to be possible, and can even seem to help us feel better about ourselves in many cases. It can also be stressful, however, and it can make us more competitive than we need to be.
 
Researchers have identified two types of social comparison: upward social comparison, where we look at people we feel are better off than we are in an attempt to become inspired and more hopeful, and downward social comparisons, where we look at people who we feel are worse off than we are, in an effort to feel better about ourselves and our situation.
 
These comparisons aren’t always bad for us, but they can sometimes be less helpful than we think they will be, and at times they are truly bad for our happiness and stress levels. Some of the factors that affect whether social comparisons are helpful or harmful are our self-esteem, the stressors we already have in our lives, and whether we’re making upward or downward social comparisons.
 
People who have higher self-esteem and fewer stressors in their lives tend to fare better with social comparisons. For example, generally speaking, when we make downward social comparisons and compare ourselves to those who are less well-off, it generally makes us feel better.
 
However, those who are already high in self-esteem experience a greater bump. Those who are lower in self-esteem or are experiencing greater threats or stress in their lives tend to use downward comparisons more often and this can lift their mood, but not as much as it does in those who are already doing better in these areas.
 
Upward social comparisons—comparing ourselves to those who are better off as a way to get inspired—can make us feel just that: inspired. Those who are going on diets can use pictures of people who embody their physical goals and feel more motivated.
 
Those who are working hard in business can have a role model they strive to emulate, and feel clearer on their path. However, those who have lower self-esteem or have recently experienced a setback can feel worse when they make upward social comparisons, both experiencing a drop in mood and often an increase in stress.
 
Social comparison comes in many forms. Basically, whenever people gather, we have a tendency to compare ourselves and usually form some sort of hierarchy, formal or unspoken. Clubs have officers who are elected and awards that are given to those who excel, and most people are aware of the more influential members.
 
Moms’ groups compare their babies’ milestones and their relationships both in an effort to be sure their kids are progressing and to measure their own success as moms. From the high achievers to those looking for friends and fun, we tend to compare.
 These comparisons can stress us, however, as we may find ourselves lacking when we make upward social comparisons, and may come off as conceited or competitive when we make downward social comparisons, which can create stress in our relationships. 
Social media has taken the social comparison to a whole new level in the last several years. We see who is doing what we’re not, and we may become stressed wondering if we’re doing enough, earning enough, enjoying life enough. We compare our regular lives with other people’s curated best memories, not knowing whether they’re just posting their highlights and the best photos out of dozens, or if they’re really sharing casual and spontaneous events as they happen.
 
Either way, many people find that social media exacerbates social comparison in all the worst ways, making many of us feel worse about ourselves, and research seems to back this up. This happens in casual, real-life scenarios as well, however.
 
Have you noticed yourself feeling happy for a friend when you hear their good news, but a twinge of regret for yourself that you’re not experiencing the same good fortune? Conversely, have you found yourself feeling a tiny jolt of satisfaction when you hear someone else has fallen down a bit, experiencing some misfortune that makes you feel luckier in comparison?
 
These feelings can sometimes be automatic, and we’re wired this way in some ways, but we don’t need to let our instincts toward social comparison be an important part of who we are; we can minimize these tendencies and counteract them with a little effort, and feel less stressed by them as a result. The first step, however, is being aware of social comparison in ourselves and in others.
 
Competitive friends can work in our favor if they're competing against themselves and supporting us to compete against ourselves, or if they playfully push us to reach our potential but fall short of making us feel bad about ourselves in the myriad ways that competitive friends can sap our self-esteem.
 If you feel judged if you feel your friend is upset when you succeed and happy when you fail, or if you feel pushed too hard, this is not a friendship that is competitive in a healthy way. 
Clearly, it’s best to have friends (and to be friends) who are only happy for one another’s success and to offer support rather than claim subtle superiority when friends experience setbacks. This can take a little effort, but it’s worth it in terms of the stress we save ourselves by eliminating competitiveness and replacing it with camaraderie.
 
There is a positive aspect to competitiveness and social comparison, of course. When our friends are all doing well, they inspire us to be our best as well, which is the upside of upward social comparison. (This is particularly true if they share the secrets of their success.)
 
And when we compare ourselves to others who have it worse than us, we tend to appreciate what we have. We realize that we could be in a worse position. We feel more grateful and we often experience more empathy as well.
 We often do better if we’re striving to keep up with a role model or successful friend, and we can make ourselves better by supporting others. 
Even the desire to avoid the embarrassment of failure can be a good motivator. The main difference in friendly competition and the competition of “frenemies” is the supportiveness factor: true friends may help motivate one another to succeed, but know that there’s no shame in falling short of the mark.
 
Frenemies seem to delight in one-upmanship and the failure of others, while true friends aren’t fully happy in their own success if their friends aren’t right there next to them, doing well too; this motivates us to help our friends succeed, to delight in their successes, and to help them keep going in tough times, which is good for everyone.
 
If you find yourself in the trap of social comparison, feeling somewhat hooked on feelings of superiority from downward social comparison or beating yourself up when you make upward social comparisons, it's important to get out of this mental trap. Here are some simple ways you can train your brain to care less about what others are doing or thinking:
 
If you’re working to keep up with role models, you can gain the benefits of their success (personal motivation, seeing what works for them, etc.) without adding the element of competitiveness to your own relationships. It’s easier to learn from a role model like Oprah Winfrey or Elon Musk than to learn from a friend In your own life without eventually feeling “less than” when they constantly achieve more.
 
It’s easier to avoid competitive friends or frenemies if you create a circle of supportive people and focus on them. This can be a group of friends who share a common goal. You can start a diet club, an exercise group, or another group built around a goal that’s either formal or informal or join a structured group you join, like Weight Watchers or a training group at the gym.
 
You can also find a “buddy” to share motivation with. Rather than a group, you and your “goal buddy” can check in with each other on your goals, celebrate together, and help motivate one another to stick with the plan.
 
This is particularly helpful because it provides both of you with individualized moral support, a bit of added responsibility to stick with the plan (or you’ll be letting your partner and yourself down), and it makes celebrating small victories a little more fun.
 
When you find yourself making comparisons, try to “even the score” in your head. If you’re feeling envious of someone else’s victory, remind yourself of your own triumphs and strengths. If you’re feeling judgmental, remind yourself of the strengths of the other person and the special things they bring to the table.
 It also helps to maintain an ongoing gratitude journal so you stay in the frame of mind of counting your blessings rather than what you lack. This also helps you to stay focused on your own life and not the lives of others. 
There are many benefits of altruism, so cultivating it as a habitual thought pattern can be even better for you than for those who benefit from your kindness. See what small things you can do for your friends and strangers. Practice loving-kindness meditation. Be your best self and you won’t feel as prone to compare.
 
If you have people in your environment who seem to constantly judge and compare, it’s okay (and even preferable) to avoid them. You may not be able to cut them out of your life entirely, but you can minimize contact and steer the conversation to neutral topics when you do see them. You can also minimize competitively comparing tendencies in yourself, and they may follow in kind.

Assertive communication can strengthen your relationships by reducing stress from conflict and providing you with social support when facing difficult times.﻿﻿ A polite but assertive ​""no"" to excessive requests from others will enable you to avoid overloading your schedule and promote balance in your life.
 
An understanding of assertive communication can also help you handle difficult family, friends, and co-workers more easily, reducing drama and stress. Ultimately, assertive communication empowers you to draw necessary boundaries﻿﻿ that allow you to get your needs met in relationships without alienating others and without letting resentment and anger creep in. This helps you to have what you need in relationships while allowing your loved ones to have their needs met too. Although many people equate assertive communication with conflict and confrontation, assertiveness actually allows people to be closer.
 
Assertive communication does take practice. Many people mistake assertiveness for aggressiveness, but assertiveness is actually the balanced middle ground between aggressiveness and passivity. Aggressiveness leads to hurt feelings and fractured relationships.﻿﻿ Passivity leads to stress and resentment,﻿﻿ and sometimes even lashing out in the end.
 
Learning to speak assertively enables you to respect everyone's needs and rights—including your own—and to maintain boundaries in relationships while helping others feel respected at the same time. These steps can help you to develop this healthy communication style (and relieve stress in your life in the process).
 
When approaching someone about a behavior you’d like to see changed, stick to factual descriptions of what they’ve done, rather than using negative labels or words that convey judgments. For example:
 
Situation: Your friend, who habitually runs late, has shown up 20 minutes late for a lunch date.Inappropriate (aggressive) response: ""You’re so rude! You’re always late.""Assertive communication: ""We were supposed to meet at 11:30, but now it’s 11:50.""
 Don’t assume you know what the other person’s motives are, especially if you think they’re negative. In this situation, don't assume that your friend deliberately arrived late because they didn't want to come or because they value their own time more than yours. 
Being factual about what you don't like in someone's behavior, without overdramatizing or judging, is an important start. The same is true for describing the effects of their behavior. Don’t exaggerate, label or judge; just describe:
 
Inappropriate response: “Now lunch is ruined.”Assertive communication: “Now I have less time to spend at lunch because I still need to be back to work by 1:00.”
 Body language and tone of voice matter in assertive communication. Let yours reflect your confidence: Stand up straight, maintain eye contact, and relax. Use a firm but pleasant tone. 
When you start a sentence with “You...”, it comes off as a judgment or an attack and puts people on the defensive. If you start with “I,” the focus is more on how you are feeling and how you are affected by their behavior. Also, it shows more ownership of your reactions and less blame. This helps minimize defensiveness in the other person, model the act of taking responsibility, and move you both toward positive change.﻿﻿ For example:
 
You Message: “You need to stop that!”I Message: “I’d like it if you’d stop that.”
 
When in a discussion, don’t forget to listen and ask questions! It’s important to understand the other person’s point of view.
 
Here’s a great formula that puts it all together: “When you [their behavior], I feel [your feelings].”
 
When used with factual statements, rather than judgments or labels, this formula provides a direct, non-attacking, more responsible way of letting people know how their behavior affects you. For example: “When you yell, I feel attacked.”
 
A more advanced variation of this formula includes the results of their behavior (again, put into factual terms), and looks like this: “When you [their behavior], then [results of their behavior], and I feel [how you feel].”
 
For example: “When you arrive late, I have to wait, and I feel frustrated.”
 
Or, “When you tell the kids they can do something that I’ve already forbidden, some of my authority as a parent is taken away, and I feel undermined.”
 
Try to think win-win: See if you can find a compromise or a way for you both to get your needs met. In the case of the always-late friend, maybe a different meeting place would help them be on time. Or you can choose to make plans only at times when your schedule is more open and their lateness won't cause you as much stress.

Stress management has been associated with increased senior health and well-being. While retirement seems to be a time of little stress. After all, with job stress that’s been endured for decades out of the picture, one may wonder if there even is stress after retirement — senior stress can still originate from relationships, finances, and retirement itself, as well as from many other areas of life.
 
The following are effective methods of stress management that may be especially conducive to senior health.
 
Studies on meditation show that it can not only provide relief from stress when it is practiced but can help build a kind of immunity to future stress — your stress response may be triggered less often if you meditate regularly. Meditation is also an ideal stress reliever for seniors in that it requires no special equipment or physical ability, can be practiced in a variety of settings, and provides excellent relief from stress.
 
Solving Sudoku or crossword puzzles, or working on other thinking games can provide mental stimulation akin to ‘brain exercise.’ Because these games require focused concentration, they can provide a helpful distraction for those who tend to ruminate over stressors, plus the benefits of mental stimulation. You can get a lot of mental stimulation by doing the daily crossword puzzle from your local newspaper, or you can go the more high-tech route of playing a portable game like Brain Age for the Nintendo DS. You can also play fun online games.
 
Research shows that yoga can help promote well-being and improve quality of life in seniors, as well as enhance senior health. It’s also an excellent stress relief tool and can carry other physical benefits.
 While some forms of yoga have a spiritual component, yoga can be practiced as a purely physical exercise, making it compatible with all faiths. 
The practice of yoga allows a lot of flexibility, so it’s a good choice for people of all ability levels and fitness goals.
 
Breathing exercises are an extremely convenient, fast-acting and effective stress reliever that can be easily adopted by people of any age, including seniors. Wherever you are, it’s possible to diffuse stress with a few deep, controlled breaths.
 
Sometimes just looking at something a different way can make it seem less stressful. Practice finding the positive in a situation, looking at it from a different angle, or even working with a therapist on a specific situation, and you may find that your stress response is triggered less and less. ‘Cognitive restructuring’ is a clinical term for changing the way you look at things, an important part of cognitive therapy, which has been found to be extremely helpful for a variety of issues, including stress.

Yoga has long been known to be a great antidote to stress. Yoga combines many popular stress-reducing techniques, including exercise and learning to control the breath, clear the mind, and relax the body. As yoga becomes increasingly popular, more and more people are discovering the benefits this ancient practice brings to their stressful lives. Establishing a consistent yoga routine is the best way to experience the difference yoga can make. This five-pose stress management yoga routine is intended for beginners who think they don't have time for yoga.
 
Hatha Yoga is the physical practice of yoga postures. There are many different types of hatha yoga: some are slow and more focused on stretching, others are fast and more of a workout. If you are looking to relieve stress, no one yoga style is superior, so pick one that meets your level of physical fitness and personality. Any exercise will help relieve stress by keeping the body healthy and releasing endorphins, natural hormones that make you feel better. Yoga also relieves stress through stretching.﻿﻿
 When you are stressed, tension is stored in the body making you feel tight and often causing pain. 
The stretching of yoga releases tension from problem areas, including the hips and shoulders. Relief of low back pain is another common benefit.
 
Pranayama, or breath work, is an important part of any yoga practice and one that translates well to life off the mat. At the very least, yoga increases your awareness of the breath as a tool for relaxing the body. Although breathing is an involuntary act (you have to keep doing it to stay alive), you can choose to regulate the breath. Just learning to take deep breaths and realizing that this can be a quick way to combat stressful situations is amazingly effective.﻿﻿
 
Our minds are constantly active, racing from one thought to another, spinning possible scenarios for the future, dwelling on incidents from the past. All this mind work is tiring and stressful.
 
Yoga offers several techniques for taming the monkey mind. One is breath work, as outlined above. Each breath is tied inextricably to the present moment; you are not breathing in the past or the future, but only right now. Focusing on each inhale and exhale to the exclusion of other thoughts is one way to clear the mind, It is also a basic meditation technique. In addition, the performance of yoga poses, or asanas, also acts as a form of meditation. The poses are so physical and have to be done with such concentration, that all other thoughts and worries are put to the side, giving your brain a much-needed break.
 
Each yoga sessions ends with five to ten minutes spent relaxing in corpse pose - savasana. While this enforced relaxation can be difficult at first, eventually it serves the purpose of a total release for both body and mind. Savasana transitions you back into the world feeling refreshed and equipped with the tools to combat stress in your daily life. Yoga Nidra is a practice that offers an opportunity for a longer, deeper period of relaxation and an introduction to meditation, which can also be a great stress reducer.

If you’re like most of us, you may wish you had more time in the day. While I can’t offer you a 25-hour day, I can offer a strategy for increasing your energy so that you can make the most of the time you do have—get regular exercise.
 
Sound easier said than done? The following tips are designed for stressed and busy people who want to sneak in activity to rev up their energy and get more out of their waking hours.
 
If you don't have time to go to a gym once a day, you can save time by bringing workout shoes to the office and walking during your lunch break. You likely won't get as sweaty as you would if you were doing more strenuous exercise, and you'll get a good workout without taking much time out of your schedule. 
 
In that vein, there's a simple and convenient tool for working exercise into your day: a Fitbit pedometer. Carrying a monitor that measures how many steps you take in a day doesn't automatically get you extra exercise, but it helps you track your 'daily step count', and keep your mind on how much you're physically moving, and that alone can be a motivational tool to help you move more.
 
First, see how much you walk in a day without trying to increase your step count—then see if you can raise the number of steps you take by 500 or 1000.
 Aim to get creative and find new ways to work additional steps into your day, including joining challenge groups and expect your cardio output to naturally rise. 
Fitness trackers can be used in other ways to promote stress relief—to track sleep and ensure you get a healthy amount, to use social support to help you stay on-target with your goals, and to track your weight, for example—so they are highly recommended! 
 
Find a sport you like, and take a class. If you put it into your schedule, you'll be less likely to skip the workouts. Plus, officially carving out the time helps you prevent pushing exercise off by the wayside. (Think of it like an office meeting you can't skip out on.) Finally, if it's an activity you enjoy, this in itself will feel like a stress reliever--you'll feel that you're doing something for yourself, for your own peace of mind, and that can make a busy day of doing necessary tasks for others more bearable and less stressful, too.
 
It's a great idea to do yoga in the morning. You can sneak in a good workout and score the serenity and other benefits yoga provides at the same time. Doing yoga before your morning shower can become a part of your routine that doesn’t take up too much additional time—you can even do it in your pajamas.
 
Studies show that several mini-workouts can be as effective as one big one in terms of cardiovascular and overall health benefits. If you have a full, busy schedule, you may find it much easier to split your workout into smaller chunks.
 If your work day is long, breaking up the day with several 10-minute workouts can even wake you up and make you more productive. 
If you’re busy, you may feel you can’t afford to spend time exercising. But the truth is, you really can’t afford not to.
 
Not only will exercise give you more energy to accomplish things and help you relieve stress, it can improve your overall health in important ways. The important thing to remember about exercise when you’re stressed and busy is to be as efficient with your workouts as possible. You can also create energy by:

Planting a beautiful garden can be a great way to relieve stress. Whether you have a small patio to decorate or a vast amount of space to tend, the act of making your particular stretch of nature into a haven can be a stress reliever in itself, and the garden that you create can bring you even more peace. In one study, subjects were asked to perform a stressful task and then asked to either perform 30 minutes of gardening in their allotment gardens or 30 minutes of reading.
 
While both groups experienced a decrease in stress, the gardeners experienced a significantly greater decline in stress (as measured by salivary cortisol, a stress hormone), as well as a full restoration of positive mood; the readers actually experienced a further decline in mood.
 
We're certainly not knocking reading as a stress reliever. However, gardening clearly has a positive impact on stress as well as mood and isn't always thought of as the go-to stress relief activity that reading is, and perhaps it deserves a little more attention as a stress relief option. There are several benefits to gardening that can minimize stress. Here are a few reasons that gardening is a fantastic stress reliever.
 
Just getting out in the sunlight can actually improve your mood! (This is part of why Seasonal Affective Disorder affects some people during winter months when there is less sunlight.) Sunlight also provides an influx of vitamin D, and the fresh air that that goes with it is good for your health. Getting outdoors to work with your garden is a great excuse to get more of this good stuff.
 
Being in touch with nature and the great outdoors can help you feel more removed from the stressors of daily life. With the amount of time we spend indoors (at work, watching t.v., etc), many people feel an urge to connect with nature that goes unfulfilled. While you may not have the time to go camping or take a nature hike each day, having your piece of nature right outside your back door can help you feel some of this connection.
 
The beauty of nature is a great stress reliever in itself. (Just think of how many times relaxation has been connected with pictures of stunning landscapes or recordings of nature’s sounds.) Having your own bit of beauty available as a place for meditation, contemplation, and relaxation can provide quite a bit of relief from stress. It’s all part of making your home a haven from stress.
 
Given the size of space you have to work with, your personal tastes and the amount of time and money you can devote to the worthwhile and fun project of fixing up your piece of the outdoors, you have many, many options to choose from. Getting started might seem a little intimidating, but finding a few good books or magazines on gardening can give you lots of information and ideas to work with.
 
Once you’ve started, you should find that the act of creating a garden can bring you peace, and the garden itself can bring you joy. Have fun.

The technology age has given us access to abundant information, has simplified many aspects of our lives, and has even improved our ability to connect with others throughout the world. It does, however, come with a few downsides. For instance, a 2019 study found that spending too much time on the internet, to the point of addiction, can profoundly impact our mental health.﻿﻿ Even non-addicted internet usage can negatively affect us.
 
“Our technology-heavy world absolutely leads to increased stress in people of all ages. Over the last 10 years, I have seen a huge jump in my private practice of individuals who have stress and anxiety disorders as a direct result of technology use,” says Dr. Lisa Strohman, a psychologist and the founder of Digital Citizens Academy. “Stress in general affects our overall health and wellness by disrupting our body’s natural rhythm and patterns like digestion, sleep and immune health.”
 
Many of these downsides have been widely discussed, but it’s also important to call out some of more “hidden” stressors of technology, too. By knowing and understanding what unassuming things can often trigger stress, we can better curb that anxiety.
 
Having a veritable computer in our pockets is incredible, but we’ve become so reliant on our devices that it’s hard to put them away. The urge to read a new text message after that familiar ding is hard to shake even in the middle of something important (like driving, crossing a street, or spending time with a loved one), and reaching for our phone is a default whenever we’re even minutely bored or lonely.
 “We have built a dependency on always being connected to our phones because now we can access the internet, our banking, our music and so, so much more. They have become our whole lives and so there is a fear to ever be without them. This fear then leads to stress as we always have a need to feel attached,” says Dr. Strohman. 
There’s even a term for the fear of being disconnected from your phone: nomophobia.
 
Dr. Strohman says that we can prevent anxious feelings over smartphone use by creating boundaries that are non-negotiable for ourselves. Healthy phone boundaries might include not using it during a meal, when you’re in a social situation, before bedtime, or in the bathroom. It might also mean creating set time limits for how long you spend on your phone or a particular app.
 
It may take time to become comfortable with reduced phone usage but finding the right balance will ultimately make you feel more in control.
 
It’s human nature to read into the smallest details, and texting is especially good at bringing this trait out in us. For instance, a short response to your long message might be interpreted as a cold and indifferent shrug, seeing a message was delivered without getting an immediate response might feel like you’re being purposefully ignored (Did you do something wrong? Do they still like you? Are they hurt or injured?), and even the bubbling ellipses icon that appears when someone’s writing a message can induce a flurry of stress.
 
The truth is that you're able to garner so much more through an in-person exchange than you’ll ever be able to garner via a text situation, and over-obsessing about these small details does us more harm than good.
 Take note of when you’re feeling anxiety during a text exchange and ask yourself if there’s a valid reason why you might feel the way you do. Then ask yourself what you might be able to do to reduce that anxiety. 
In many cases, the answer is to distance yourself from your phone and occupy your time with things that bring you joy—such as a hobby, going for a walk, spending time with loved ones, focusing on work, or hitting the gym. Also, just seeing that person in real life, or calling them, can squash a lot of anxiety.
 
Online gaming can be fun and exciting, but many games are designed in a way that can cause us to become addicted very easily. Maybe we feel an alliance to others on our team and don’t step away when it’d be healthier for us to do so, or maybe we spend much of our free time gaming while other important activities—such as exercise or healthy eating or real-life engagements—are left behind.
 “For some people, playing video games and dedicating the time it takes to be successful is like having a second life. There can be countless hours dedicated to fighting, competing, and practice to be your best self within the game. This will cause stress for players who feel as though every minute they spend away from the game is a minute tragically lost,” says Dr. Strohman. 
This probably won't come as a surprise, but the key to avoiding anxious feelings with gaming is to limit the amount of time you actually spend gaming. Again, it's about creating healthy boundaries and acknowledging and stopping unhealthy behaviors. Balancing a healthy activity with gaming will break up your screen time and also give you an added distraction and interest outside of the video game.
 
While social media connects us to others, it’s important to understand how detrimental constant exposure might be to our mental health. For example, scrolling through Instagram or Facebook viewing others’ happy faces, beautiful travel photos, and amazing dinners can sometimes make us feel bad about where we’re at in our lives.
 “Social media is a huge stressor these days for multiple reasons, but, mainly it is the constant expectation of being ‘Insta-worthy’ and the unceasing comparisons that are inflicted upon us,” says Dr. Strohman. 
She continues, “The stress of feeling like you need to post everything you’re doing, seeing, eating, watching is very real and is becoming more dominating every day. There’s not only the stress of always having to post to stay relevant, but also the stress of comparing your body, life, and experiences with your peers and also strangers. This sets us up for unrealistic expectations of life.”
 
All that said, it’s important to remember that we’re only seeing the best 5% of other people's lives—the most flattering pictures, the best moments, the accolades, the vacations, the anniversary celebrations. Even thumbing through your very own photo reel can cause a little jealousy!
 
Interestingly, we’re starting to see a pendulum swing here. Everyday people, influencers, and celebrities are craving and posting less filtered, “real content.” This can be helpful to see, but it doesn’t mean you have to feel the pressure to “be real,” yourself, and it doesn’t even mean that what you’re seeing is actually entirely real.
 
It’s not easy, but one of the best things you can do, says Dr. Strohman, is to thoughtfully disengage more often from social media.
 
She says, “Be more present, be in the moment, stop feeling every move you make has to be documented or talked about. Also just remembering that pictures do not say everything about a person’s life and that these carefully curated posts are only the happiest, best, most exciting photos that are trying to sell the idea of perfection.”

Everyone has one—that Facebook friend that posts obnoxious, and sometimes offensive, political statements, articles, memes and more every day, multiple times a day. You know—that friend that has a strong opinion about anything and everything political. Even if you agree with her political views, you cringe at the inflammatory way she states her opinions.
 
If you find yourself in this situation, you are not alone. In fact, unfriending someone for their political views is fairly common.
 According to a study by Pew Research Center, nearly 20% of social media users have blocked, unfriended or hidden someone because of their political posts online.﻿﻿ 
This fact should not be surprising. Civility in politics has been decreasing for a long time and people are losing patience with the rhetoric. Much of this increase in online bullying, shaming, and political bullying has to do with the changing culture and the ability to insult others on the Internet. These insults are often made through the use of blogs, social media and more. Consequently, it is not surprising that people have become much freer with their use of words. This has become painfully apparent in recent years as religious and political disagreements become more and more volatile. And while many people have embraced the freedom that social media provides, just as many are simply fed up.
 
In the 2016 election, both candidates engaged in name-calling and other bullying tactics. For instance, Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, called people who supported Republican presidential nominee, ""deplorables,"" and said they were irredeemable. Meanwhile, Trump labeled Clinton a ""nasty woman"" and referred to her as ""Crooked Hillary.""
 
Even the supporters of each candidate engaged in bullying tactics. On social media, Clinton supporters shamed Trump supporters by calling them racists, homophobes, xenophobes and a variety of other labels. On the Republican side of things, supporters yelled ""build that wall,"" and chanted ""lock her up"" at rallies and posted similar sentiments online.
 
There is no doubt that the campaigning and debates in 2016 ignited tempers, unlike any other presidential race, has done. And while there has always been some mudslinging during elections, the 2016 election was much more volatile, much more personal. Many believe that the passionate disagreements were far more prevalent because of the ease and influence of social media. What's more, social media empowers people to say things that they would never say to someone's face. Much of this has to do with the fact that they can hide behind a computer screen.
 
As a result, during the election season, people on social media were not just ranting about how much they disliked the candidates, but they often took it a step further. They also ranted about how much they disliked anyone who might support an opposing candidate often engaging in name-calling, shaming, labeling and sometimes even threats of violence. It was cyberbullying at its worst.
 
And while most would argue that people have a right to speak their mind, is bullying through social media really free speech? Most would argue that in some ways the mean-spirited posts, the labeling, and the name-calling actually silence free speech. As a result, people are afraid to be honest about what they really think for fear of being judged or labeled.​
 
Additionally, when people do not talk about their views or why they believe a certain way, they start to make assumptions about what other people believe. This often causes them to believe that they are being judged. They also assume that people are displeased with them or disagree with them. Yet, they have never talked about what they truly believe nor have they asked why their friends believe the way that they do. As a result, there is a lot of hostility and frustration based solely on assumptions.
 
If you are someone that would rather see posts about a person's dinner than her monologue about a political candidate, here are some sure-fire ways to navigate the lack of digital etiquette on Facebook without losing your sanity.
 
Take a minute. When it comes to social media, it is easy to fire off a response before you really think about it. Resist the urge to react instead of respond. Slow down and take a minute. Scroll past the post and read something else. The goal is to avoid posting something equally inflammatory and then later regretting it. Remember, even if you delete your comment later, you can never truly make it go away. So put on the brakes. A thoughtful response, or even no response at all, is a much better approach in the long run.
 
Ask why. Not only does it allow for greater understanding, but it also broadens your own perspective. Just be sure to ask in a way that doesn't put your friend on the defensive. You don't want her to feel like she has to justify her feelings to you. Instead, keep the focus on the issues. Additionally, it might be best to have this type of conversation offline and in person. This way, you can actually see the emotions she is expressing rather than trying to assume you know by interpreting her words. A lot of interpretation is lost online. It is risky to assume you know what someone is feeling when all you have to go on are a few typed words.
 If you do not understand why a friend feels so strongly, ask her. Find out how this impacts her life. Sometimes it helps to view the world through a different lens. 
Ignore, scan or move on. Sometimes the best way to deal with cringe-worthy political posts is to simply scan through them and move on, especially if the post is simply a rant laced with name-calling and labeling. An even better option is to ignore them altogether. Remember, you cannot control what your Facebook friend posts online. And you probably won't be able to change her mind or even get her to see your side of things. But you can control how you respond. And if reading her posts irritates you, ruins your day or causes you anxiety, then it is healthier for you to ignore them. Do not allow another person's blanket bullying statements impact you and your day.
 
Utilize the hide or block options. Fortunately, Facebook offers some options for dealing with the deluge of political bullying that takes place online. One option is to ""hide"" your friend. With this option, you remain friends but you no longer see her posts in your newsfeed. A lot of people appreciate this option because they do not want the drama of unfriending someone online, but they also do not want to see their blatantly inappropriate posts any longer either. Of course, the other option is to unfriend the person and even block her from friending you again. This option should only be used in extreme cases where you no longer hope to have contact or a relationship with the person. It is very hard to salvage a friendship once you have unfriended or blocked them on Facebook.
 
Remember who you are dealing with. If you are friends with this person online, chances are you have some sort of relationship with the person. So when you see something that is unsettling, take a step back and look at the big picture. Is your friend going through a tough time right now? Could these political posts have something to do with a bigger issue in her life? Try to be empathetic and remember why you are friends with this person in the first place. However, if your friend's political views define who she is as a person and it gets under your skin, you have some evaluating to do. Is this person a toxic friend that you should avoid, or is her friendship worth an effort?
 
Set some limits. If you find yourself getting too worked up about other people's political posts and subtle bullying online, it might be a good idea to take a break. You need to protect yourself from the negative feelings these posts create in you. As a result, you may want to limit the time you spend on Facebook or take a break from it altogether. Or maybe the answer is to avoid engaging in any political discussions online. If you find that you absolutely have to say something in response to all the negativity online, consider journaling your responses but then never posting them. In this way, you have released your frustration by formulating a response, but you have not offended anyone, or ticked off your employer, by actually posting it.
 
Check your answers. Remember, there are a lot of unsubstantiated articles and information online. Make sure that if you do post a response to a political post, that your post is factual and can be verified. You don't want to contribute to the plethora of misinformation that is floating around on Facebook. Make sure that what you post is factual, accurate and not offensive. Keep in mind, that your goal should become a conscientious poster and not just someone who shares sensationalized stories because of their shock value. The last thing you want to do is to become just like your obnoxiously-political friend. After all, you need to protect your online reputation.

"
We all have an inner critic. At times this little voice can actually be helpful and keep us motivated toward goals—like when it reminds us that what we're about to eat isn't healthy or what we're about to do may not be wise. However, this voice can often be more harmful than helpful, particularly when it gets into the realm of excessive negativity. This is known as negative self-talk, and it can really bring us down.
 
Negative self-talk is something that most of us experience from time to time, and it comes in many forms. It also creates significant stress, not only to us but to those around us if we're not careful. Here's what you need to know about negative self-talk and its effects on your body, your mind, your life, and your loved ones.
 
Negative self-talk can take many forms. It can sound grounded (""I'm not good at this, so I should avoid attempting it for my own personal safety,"" for example) or it's downright mean (""I can never do anything right!""). It may seem like a realistic appraisal of a situation (""I got a C on this test. I guess I'm not good at math.""), only to devolve into a fear-based fantasy (""I'll never be able to go to a good college"").
 
The musings of your inner critic may sound a lot like a critical parent or friend from your past. It can follow the path of typical cognitive distortions: catastrophizing, blaming, and the like.
 
Basically, negative self-talk is any inner dialogue you have with yourself that may be limiting your ability to believe in yourself and your own abilities, and to reach your potential. It is any thought that diminishes your ability to make positive changes in your life or your confidence in yourself to do so. So negative self-talk can not only be stressful, but it can really stunt your success.
 
Negative self-talk can affect us in some pretty damaging ways. One large-scale study found that rumination and self-blame over negative events were linked to an increased risk of mental health problems.﻿﻿ 
 
Focusing on negative thoughts may lead to decreased motivation as well as greater feelings of helplessness. This type of critical inner dialogue has even been linked to depression, so it's definitely something to fix. 
 Those who find themselves frequently engaging in negative self-talk tend to be more stressed. This is in large part due to the fact that their reality is altered to create an experience where they don't have the ability to reach the goals they've set for themselves. 
Negative self-talk can lead to a lowered ability to see opportunities, as well as a decreased tendency to capitalize on these opportunities. This means that the heightened sense of stress comes from both the perception and the changes in behavior that come from it. Other consequences of negative self-talk can include:
 
One of the most obvious drawbacks of negative self-talk is that it's not positive. This sounds simplistic, but research has shown that positive self-talk is a great predictor of success.﻿﻿
 
For example, one study on athletes compared four different types of self-talk (instructional, motivational, positive, and negative) and found that positive self-talk was the greatest predictor of success.﻿﻿ People didn't need to remind themselves how to do something as much as they needed to tell themselves that they are doing something great and that others notice it as well. 
 
There are many ways to reduce the self-talk in your daily life. Different strategies work better for different people, so try a few on and see which ones are most effective for you.
 
Learn to notice when you're being self-critical so you can begin to stop. For example, notice when you say things to yourself that you wouldn't say to a good friend or a child. 
 
Thinking negative things about yourself may feel like astute observations, but your thoughts and feelings about yourself can definitely not be considered accurate information. Your thoughts can be skewed like everyone else's, subject to biases and the influence of your moods.
 
There was once a ""Saturday Night Live"" character known as Debbie Downer. She would find the negative in any situation. If your inner critic has this dubious skill as well, you can tell yourself, ""Debbie Downer is doing her thing again.""
 
When you think of your inner critic as a force outside of yourself and even give it a goofy nickname, it's not only more easy to realize that you don't have to agree, but it becomes less threatening and more easy to see how ridiculous some of your critical thoughts can be.
 
If you find yourself engaging in negative self-talk, it helps to contain the damage that a critical inner voice can cause by only allowing it to criticize certain things in your life, or be negative for only an hour in your day. This puts a limit on how much negativity can come from the situation.
 
When engaging in negative self-talk, you may be able to catch yourself, but it can sometimes be difficult to force yourself to stop a train of thought in its tracks. It's often far easier to change the intensity of your language. ""I can't stand this"" becomes, ""This is challenging."" ""I hate..."" becomes, ""I don't like..."" and even, ""I don't prefer..."" When your self-talk uses more gentle language, much of its negative power is muted as well.
 
One of the damaging aspects of negative self-talk is that it often goes unchallenged. After all, if it's going on in your head, others may not be aware of what you're saying and thus can't tell you how wrong you are.
 
It's far better to catch your negative self-talk and ask yourself how true it is. The vast majority of negative self-talk is an exaggeration, and calling yourself on this can help to take away its damaging influence.
 
When our inner critic is at its worst, it can sound like our worst enemy. Often we'll say things to ourselves in our heads that we'd never say to a friend. Why not reverse this and—when you catch yourself speaking negatively in your head—make it a point to imagine yourself saying this to a treasured friend.
 
If you know you wouldn't say it this way, think of how you'd share your thoughts with a good friend or what you'd like a good friend to say to you. This is a great way to shift your self-talk in general. 
 
Sometimes looking at things in the long term can help you to realize that you may be placing too great an emphasis on something. For example, you may ask yourself if something you're upset by will really matter in five years or even one.
 
Another way to shift perspective is to imagine that you are panning out and looking at your problems from a great distance. Even thinking of the world as a globe and of yourself as a tiny, tiny person on this globe can remind you that most of your worries aren't as big as they seem. This can often minimize the negativity, fear, and urgency in negative self-talk.
 
Sometimes when you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts in your mind, simply saying them aloud can help. Telling a trusted friend what you're thinking about can often lead to a good laugh and shine a light on how ridiculous some of our negative self-talk can be. Other times, it can at least bring support.
 
Even saying some negative self-talk phrases around under your breath can remind you how unreasonable and unrealistic they sound. This will remind you to give yourself a break.
 
For some, simply stopping negative thoughts in their tracks can be helpful. This is known as ""thought-stopping"" and can take the form of snapping a rubber band on your wrist, visualizing a stop sign, or simply changing to another thought when a negative one enters your mind. This can be helpful with repetitive or extremely critical thoughts like, ""I'm no good,"" or, ""I'll never be able to do this,"" for example.
 
This is one of the best routes to combating negative self-talk: Replace it with something better. Take a negative thought and change it to something encouraging that's also accurate.
 
Repeat until you find yourself needing to do it less and less often. This works well with most bad habits: replacing unhealthy food with healthy food, for example. It's a great way to develop a more positive way of thinking about yourself and about life.
 Limited thinking: The more you tell yourself you can't do something, the more you believe it. Perfectionism: You begin to really believe that ""great"" isn't as good as ""perfect,"" and that perfection is actually attainable. In contrast, mere high achievers tend to do better than their perfectionistic counterparts because they are generally less stressed and are happy with a job well done. They don't pick it apart and try to zero in on what could have been better. Feelings of depression: Some research has shown that negative self-talk can lead to an exacerbation of feelings of depression.﻿﻿ If left unchecked, this could be quite damaging. Relationship challenges: Whether the constant self-criticism makes you seem needy and insecure or you turn your negative self-talk into more general negative habits that bother others, a lack of communication and even a ""playful"" amount of criticism can take a toll.​",inner critic time little voice actually helpful keep motivate toward goals like remind eat healthy may wise however voice

If you're worried about money, you're not alone. Money is a common source of stress for American adults. In fact, according to the American Psychological Association (APA), 72% of adults report feeling stressed about money, whether it's worrying about paying rent or feeling bogged down by debt. This is pretty significant given financial stress is linked to so many health issues.﻿﻿
 
Although any stress can take a toll on your health, stress related to financial issues can be especially toxic. Financial stress can lead to:
 
Learning to cope with financial stress and effectively manage your financial situation can help you feel more in control of your life, reduce your stress, and build a more secure future. Try some of the following tips to get started:
 
If you feel that the stress of your financial situation is too much for you to handle, it's important to share your concerns and not just keep them to yourself. Talk about your money concerns with trusted friends and family. You don’t have to go into details if you aren’t comfortable with them, but the more you talk about your concerns with your support system, the less isolated and stressed you will feel. Your loved ones may even be able to offer a new perspective on what you could do differently to get your financial issue under control.
 Poor physical health: Ongoing stress about money has been linked to migraines, heart disease, diabetes, sleep problems, and more.﻿﻿ Left untreated, these conditions can lead to life-threatening illnesses, which can plunge you even further into debt. Delayed healthcare: With less money in the budget, people who are already under financial stress tend to cut corners in areas they shouldn't, like healthcare. According to Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare poll, 29% of American adults held off seeking medical care in 2018 because of cost. Though this tactic may seem like a good way to keep costs down, delaying medical care can actually lead to worse health outcomes and higher costs,﻿﻿ both of which can lead to more stress. Poor mental health: In many instances, the link between mental and financial health is cyclical—poor financial health can lead to poor mental health, which leads to increasingly poor financial health, and so on. For years, studies have shown that people in debt have higher rates of mental health issues like depression and anxiety than those who are debt-free. Unhealthy coping behaviors: Financial stress can cause you to engage in a variety of unhealthy behaviors, from overeating to alcohol and drug misuse. According to an APA survey published in 2014, 33% of Americans reported eating unhealthy foods or eating too much to deal with stress. Understand the debt cycle. Understanding debt is the first step to getting yourself out of it. Once you know how to break out, you can start building toward your future in a more positive way with simple habits that are easy to maintain. Create extra sources of income. If you're feeling stressed about finances, you likely already feel you need more money in your budget. But knowing how to increase your financial holdings without creating significant stress for yourself can be tricky, too. Thankfully, there are several ways to boost your income and relieve your stress. Declutter your budget. Since life is rarely constant, regular budget checkups are essential to improving your financial health. Take control of your finances by setting aside some time to schedule, organize, and declutter all of the money coming in and out of your bank account. The more control you have, the less stress you will feel. Don't forget general stress management. As you work on improving your financial situation, you can reduce stress by practicing stress-reducing techniques and making other changes to create a low-stress lifestyle.",worry money alone money common source stress american adults fact accord american psychological association apa adults report feel stress money whether worry pay rent feel bogged debt pretty significant give financial stress link many health issue although stress take toll health stress relate financial issue especially toxic financial stress lead learn cope financial stress effectively manage financial situation help feel control life reduce stress build secure future try follow tip get start feel stress financial situation much handle important share concern keep talk money concern trust friends family detail comfortable talk concern support system less isolate stress feel love ones may even able offer new perspective could differently get financial issue control poor physical health ongoing stress money link migraines heart disease diabetes sleep problems leave untreated condition lead life threaten illnesses plunge even debt delay healthcare less money budget people already financial stress tend cut corner areas like healthcare accord gallup annual health healthcare poll american adults hold seek medical care cost though tactic may seem like good way keep cost delay medical care actually lead worse health outcomes higher cost lead stress poor mental health many instance link mental financial health cyclical poor financial health lead poor mental health lead increasingly poor financial health years study show people debt higher rat mental health issue like depression anxiety debt free unhealthy cop behaviors financial stress cause engage variety unhealthy behaviors overeat alcohol drug misuse accord apa survey publish americans report eat unhealthy foods eat much deal stress understand debt cycle understand debt first step get know break start build toward future positive way simple habit easy maintain create extra source income feel stress finance likely already feel need money budget know increase financial hold without create significant stress tricky thankfully several ways boost income relieve stress declutter budget since life rarely constant regular budget checkups essential improve financial health take control finance set aside time schedule organize declutter money come bank account control less stress feel forget general stress management work improve financial situation reduce stress practice stress reduce techniques make change create low stress lifestyle

People who are struggling to cope with workplace stress may place themselves at high risk of burnout. Burnout can leave people feeling exhausted, empty, and unable to cope with the demands of life.
 
Burnout may be accompanied by a variety of mental and physical health symptoms as well. If left unaddressed, burnout can make it difficult for an individual to function well in their daily life.
 
The term “burnout” is a relatively new term, first coined in 1974 by Herbert Freudenberger, in his book, Burnout: The High Cost of High Achievement. He originally defined burnout as, “the extinction of motivation or incentive, especially where one's devotion to a cause or relationship fails to produce the desired results.”
 Burnout is a reaction to prolonged or chronic job stress and is characterized by three main dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism (less identification with the job), and feelings of reduced professional ability. 
More simply put, if you feel exhausted, start to hate your job, and begin to feel less capable at work, you are showing signs of burnout.﻿﻿
 
The stress that contributes to burnout can come mainly from your job, but stress from your overall lifestyle can add to this stress. Personality traits and thought patterns, such as perfectionism and pessimism, can contribute as well.﻿﻿
 
Most people spend the majority of their waking hours working. And if you hate your job, dread going to work, and don't gain any satisfaction out of what you're doing, it can take a serious toll on your life.﻿﻿
 
While burnout isn’t a diagnosable psychological disorder, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken seriously.
 
Here are some of the most common signs of burnout:﻿﻿
 
It shares some similar symptoms of mental health conditions, such as depression. Individuals with depression experience negative feelings and thoughts about all aspects of life, not just at work. Depression symptoms may also include a loss of interest in things, feelings of hopelessness, cognitive and physical symptoms as well as thoughts of suicide.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Individuals experiencing burnout also may be at a higher risk of developing depression.﻿﻿
 
A high-stress job doesn't always lead to burnout. If stress is managed well, there may not be any ill-effects.
 
But some individuals (and those in certain occupations) are at a higher risk than others.
 The 2019 National Physician Burnout, Depression, and Suicide Report found that 44 percent of physicians experience burnout. 
Their heavy workloads place individuals with certain personality characteristics and lifestyle features at a higher risk of burnout.
 
Of course, it's not just physicians who are burning out. Workers in every industry at every level are at potential risk. According to a 2018 report by Gallup, employee burnout has five main causes:﻿﻿
 
Although the term ""burnout"" suggests it may be a permanent condition, it's reversible. An individual who is feeling burned out may need to make some changes to their work environment.﻿﻿
 
Approaching the human resource department about problems in the workplace or talking to a supervisor about the issues could be helpful if they are invested in creating a healthier work environment.
 
In some cases, a change in position or a new job altogether may be necessary to put an end to burnout.
 
It can also be helpful to develop clear strategies that help you manage your stress. Self-care strategies, like eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercises, and engaging in healthy sleep habits may help reduce some of the effects of a high-stress job.
 
A vacation may offer you some temporary relief too, but a week away from the office won't be enough to help you beat burnout. Regularly scheduled breaks from work, along with daily renewal exercises, can be key to helping you combat burnout.
 If you are experiencing burnout and you're having difficulty finding your way out, or you suspect that you may also have a mental health condition such as depression, seek professional treatment. 
Talking to a mental health professional may help you discover the strategies you need to feel your best.
 Alienation from work-related activities: Individuals experiencing burnout view their jobs as increasingly stressful and frustrating. They may grow cynical about their working conditions and the people they work with. They may also emotionally distance themselves and begin to feel numb about their work. Physical symptoms: Chronic stress may lead to physical symptoms, like headaches and stomachaches or intestinal issues. Emotional exhaustion: Burnout causes people to feel drained, unable to cope, and tired. They often lack the energy to get their work done. Reduced performance: Burnout mainly affects everyday tasks at work—or in the home when someone's main job involves caring for family members. Individuals with burnout feel negative about tasks. They have difficulty concentrating and often lack creativity. Unreasonable time pressure. Employees who say they have enough time to do their work are 70 percent less likely to experience high burnout. Individuals who are not able to gain more time, such as paramedics and firefighters, are at a higher risk of burnout. Lack of communication and support from a manager. Manager support offers a psychological buffer against stress. Employees who feel strongly supported by their manager are 70 percent less likely to experience burnout on a regular basis. Lack of role clarity. Only 60 percent of workers know what is expected of them. When expectations are like moving targets, employees may become exhausted simply by trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing. Unmanageable workload. When a workload feels unmanageable, even the most optimistic employees will feel hopeless. Feeling overwhelmed can quickly lead to burnout. Unfair treatment. Employees who feel they are treated unfairly at work are 2.3 times more likely to experience a high level of burnout.

Are you over-scheduled and over-stressed? With today’s busy schedules, you’re not alone. One important way to pare down your schedule is to get good at saying no to new commitments. So why can the simple act of not taking on more than you can handle be so hard?
 
Maybe you've had people be upset with you when you've said no. Maybe you feel guilty because you really want to help others. Maybe you feel guilty because you really want to help others, but you say yes so much to them that you're on the verge of burnout—and this will make you less healthy and less helpful.
 
Whether you say ""yes"" instead of no out of guilt, inner conflict, or a misguided notion that you can ""do it all,"" learning to say no to more requests can be one of the biggest favors you can do yourself and those you love. There's absolutely nothing wrong with saying no when you need to (and simply not having the energy to do everything you're asked, or wanting to prioritize self-care counts as an instance when you need to say no), it helps reduce stress levels and gives you time for what’s really important. Here's how to say no with less stress and guilt—it really can be this simple.
 
That's right, sometimes it helps to stall until you have a chance to fully look at how saying ""yes"" to this new commitment may affect your life and the lives of those who already depend on you. Use a sympathetic, but firm tone. If pressured as to why, reply that it doesn’t fit into your schedule, and change the subject. Most reasonable people will accept this as an answer, so if someone keeps pressuring you, they’re being rude.
 It’s OK to just repeat, “I’m sorry, but this just doesn’t fit with my schedule,"" and change the subject, or even walk away if you have to. 
If you’re uncomfortable being so firm or are dealing with pushy people, it’s OK to say, “Let me think about it and get back to you.” This gives you a chance to review your schedule, as well as your feelings about saying ""yes"" to another commitment, do a cost-benefit analysis, and then get back to them with a yes or no. Most importantly, this tactic helps you avoid letting yourself be pressured into overscheduling your life and taking on too much stress.
 
If you would really like to do what they’re requesting, but don’t have the time (or are having trouble accepting that you don’t), it’s fine to say, “I can’t do this, but I can…” and mention a lesser commitment that you can make. This way you’ll still be partially involved, but it will be on your own terms.
 Be firm—not defensive or overly apologetic—and polite. This gives the signal that you are sympathetic, but will not easily change your mind if pressured. Be clear. If you decide to tell the person you’ll get back to them, be matter-of-fact and not too promising. If you lead people to believe you’ll likely say ""yes"" later, they’ll be more disappointed with a later ""no."" No excuses necessary. If asked for an explanation, remember that you really don’t owe anyone one. “It doesn’t fit with my schedule,” is perfectly acceptable. 
Remember that there are only so many hours in the day. This means that whatever you choose to take on limits your ability to do other things. So even if you somehow can fit a new commitment into your schedule, if it’s not more important than what you would have to give up to do it (including time for relaxation and self-care), you really don’t have the time in your schedule.
 
Discover and research strategies for finding time if you're too busy. It's also important to learn to set boundaries in general.

Working moms are notoriously busy and often find that the unpredictability of parenting, especially parenting small children, leads to additional stress. For example, a potty-training accident or emotional meltdown on the way to daycare has the potential to throw off an entire day (for both mother and child!) in terms of timing and stress.
 
If a working mom is preoccupied and stressed, she may be less efficient at her job and possibly prone to mistakes that need correcting or more likely to have a slower rate of productivity. If her child is feeling stressed and out-of-sorts, there’s more potential for further conflicts, hurt feelings and difficulty during the day. Ultimately, stress management is for the moms as well as kids who feel their stress, too.
 
The following tips can help working moms maintain some sanity and stress relief in their busy lives.
 
Being organized is a vital skill for working moms. If you're able to anticipate that potty-training accident on the way to daycare, for example, and keep an extra change of clothes in your car at all times, a near-catastrophe becomes an easy fix. If you plan ahead and streamline your routines, there's less fussing, forgetting things, and stressing as you move through your busy day.
 
Working moms play many roles, and want to be their best in all of them; indeed, the roles of mother, worker, and partner require nothing less than their best. This sometimes leads to a feeling of not being able to say no—ever.
 
For a working mom to be her best, however, she doesn't have to say yes to everyone's requests. In fact, saying ""no"" to responsibilities that aren't vital to her success and that of her family enables a working mom to say yes to the things in her life that are. Start practicing how to set boundaries in relationships right away.﻿﻿
 
While setting boundaries is vital, it's equally important for working moms to stay connected with their children.﻿﻿ Kids who feel neglected tend to act out more, and working moms who feel they aren't giving enough to their kids tend to feel stressed and guilty, so maintaining a strong connection is both emotionally beneficial and just plain pragmatic.
 
Fortunately, reducing stress doesn't need to mean giving less to kids. Spending focused time together doing an enjoyable activity can be a ""multi-tasking"" way to connect and relieve stress at the same time. Saying no on other areas can free up this time.
 
As you already know, if you aren't at your best physically and emotionally, you won't be performing at your best at work or with your kids.
 
To maintain the kind of stamina and focus required to give their best to your children and to work, it's important for working moms to care for themselves the way they care for their children: by getting plenty of sleep,﻿﻿ healthy food, and at least some ""downtime."" It's also important to enjoy positive feedback (hugs from kids and kudos from work) to avoid burnout.
 
It may be difficult to fit all of this into an already-packed schedule, but proper self-care will enable working moms to be more efficient in their lives, so it really pays off in several ways.
 
Many working moms don't realize that there are people around to help them if they ask. Families would often love to step in more often to lend a hand if only asked. Friends and neighbors can also be rallied, and supportive networks can be formed.
 
There are often ways to hire affordable help for extra things like cleaning or cooking to make a working mom's lifestyle less hectic. And the option of delegating tasks at work is often overlooked. For busy working moms, enlisting help is a smart way to make life less stressed and hectic.
 
When harried and stressed, working moms often find themselves less able to connect with their children or focus at work, which may lead to acting-out by the kids, time-consuming mistakes at work, and other things that increase stress for working moms and their families. Therefore, taking a proactive stance on stress management is quite important.
 Having several quick stress relievers on hand, such as breathing exercises and reframing techniques (different ways of looking at a stressful situation), as well as long-term stress management strategies in place, like a regular exercise or meditation regimen,﻿﻿ hobby, or supportive social circle,﻿﻿ can relieve significant stress for working moms and their families. 
In addition to these stress management practices for working moms, it's important (and often overlooked) to keep children's stress in mind. Even young children can benefit from stress relief practices like deep breathing, quiet time with mom, and massage. Because mothers and young children are so attuned to each other, reducing stress in one helps both mother and child.​

All change brings stress as a by-product. Sometimes, however, events in our lives are traumatic enough to constitute a crisis, and stress levels are nearly unmanageable. Such crises include being diagnosed with a serious health condition, dealing with the aftermath of a natural disaster, or being personally affected by a human tragedy, although events of lesser severity can also constitute a crisis.
 
What are some healthy ways to cope with a crisis and get through to the other side? Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when coping with a crisis.
 
When dealing with the aftermath of a crisis, it’s important to focus your resources. Just getting through the day is an accomplishment, so paring down your responsibilities in order to just do that should be key.
 
Order take-out so you can cut down on shopping and cooking, put unnecessary commitments on hold, and just focus on what really needs to be done, so you can conserve your physical and emotional energy.
 
If others know about your trauma, chances are they will be offering to help; now is the time to take them up on it. Let your loved ones lighten your load by helping with tasks or providing a supportive ear. You can repay the favor later when you’re up to it and they need something.
 
You can feel better from receiving support, and others will probably feel better by being able to do something to help. That’s what friends do best.
 
When you experience a crisis (or even when someone close to you experiences a crisis), your body's stress response may become triggered and stay triggered, keeping you in a state of constant stress.
 
It may be difficult to feel ""relaxed"" in the midst or aftermath of a crisis, but you can practice stress relief techniques that can reduce the intensity of your stress levels, help you reverse your stress response, and feel more resilient in the face of what comes next.
 
Whether you write in your journal, talk to a good friend, or consult a therapist, it’s important to put words to your experience in order to better integrate it.
 
As you move through the crisis, you may be tempted to ignore your feelings for fear that you’ll ‘wallow’ too much and get ‘stuck’, but processing your feelings allows you to move through them and let them go.
 
In order to avoid adding to your problems, be sure to eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and do other things to keep your body functioning at its best.
 
Also, try to do some things you normally enjoy, like seeing a movie, reading a good book, or gardening in order to relieve some of the stress that you’re going through.
 
Sometimes people who are dealing with a crisis or trauma wonder if their negative reactions are a sign of weakness, or if they’re handling things the ‘right’ way. While there are more and less healthy ways to handle troubling situations, be patient with your feelings and reactions to things.
 
It’s natural to feel ‘not yourself’ after a major—or even minor—trauma, and accepting yourself and your reactions will help you feel better and process things more easily.
 
If you experience intrusive thoughts and feelings, have recurrent nightmares, or are unable to move through your life the way you need to because of your reaction to the trauma, even after several weeks, you may want to talk to a professional about your situation to be sure you’re getting the support you need.
 
Even if you have no major problems but just feel that it might be a good idea to talk to someone, it’s better to err on the side of having extra help. It’s a smart and responsible way to take care of yourself.

While travel has always been a somewhat stressful experience, increased airport security and other factors have made travel even more stressful in recent years. Whether you’re traveling for business, vacation, or to see loved ones, there are simple steps you can take to reduce the stress of your next trip. The following tips can help make travel a bit easier on you.
 
Stay abreast of delays by checking your airline's website before you leave home, so you can avoid spending hours sitting in a waiting room. Airports' websites are useful too, as they can inform you of security measures that are in place ahead of time, so you can plan for them. Waiting for a taxi or trying to find a hotel once you arrive at your destination can sometimes be frustrating, so make any necessary reservations ahead of time (local hotels can likely refer you to the local car or taxi services, too.)
 
You can save yourself significant stress by packing wisely for your trip. Make a list of all the things you may need to bring with you, and check them off as you pack them to better ensure that you don’t leave behind things you’ll need. Pack the night before you leave, or earlier, to avoid the stress of being rushed and give yourself the opportunity to remember and pack things you may otherwise forget. Keep things you may need at the ready while in transit in your carry-on bag, but stow the rest of your items in your checked luggage to reduce your chances of getting held up at security points.
 
While passengers used to dress up for flights in days past, we now know how important it is to dress for comfort when traveling. Be sure you wear comfortable shoes (for rushing through the airport and walking to and from your car, which may need to be parked far away). Also, be sure to wear clothes that you can comfortably move in and don’t mind wearing all day.
 Wear layers if you’re traveling somewhere that has a cold climate; you’ll be warm on the airplane, but cold once you arrive. 
Take your vitamins, get quality sleep the night before your trip, and have some stress relievers on hand to decrease your chances of getting sick from the stress of travel and the germs in the re-circulated air in the airplane. (Nothing can stress you more than seeing your carefully planned trip get sidelined by a case of the sniffles—or worse.)
 
Allowing yourself ample time before your flight can reduce some of the stress of finding parking, checking bags, moving through security, and other aspects of travel that are much more stressful when you’re rushed. If you end up being early, you can read a book, listen to music, or take a walk through the airport and get some exercise before you leave. If you get held up in the process of getting to your plane, at least you won’t have to spend energy worrying about missing your flight.
 
Eating a healthy meal before you get to the airport can help reduce stress in several ways: You’ll avoid buying expensive airport food, won’t have to rely on an in-flight meal (of sometimes dubious nutritional value and taste), and won’t have to worry as much about your blood sugar levels becoming imbalanced as you travel (which can affect your mood).
 
If you get overwhelmed, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and other quick stress relievers can help you feel calm more quickly.
 
Rather than thinking of all this as a stressful hassle, think of it as an adventure—or at the very least, a challenge. With the right attitude (and other preparations), traveling can be much less stressful.
 Put metal items (like keys) in your carry-on bag rather than your pockets, so you won’t have to empty your pockets of them as you pass through the airport metal detector. Travel early in the day; earlier flights are less likely to be delayed. Bring a distraction, such as an interesting new book, so delays and long flights will be an opportunity to relax.",travel always somewhat stressful experience increase airport security factor make travel even stressful recent years whether travel business vacation see love ones simple step take reduce stress next trip follow tip help make travel bite easier stay abreast delay check airline website leave home avoid spend hours sit wait room airports websites useful inform security measure place ahead time plan wait taxi try find hotel arrive destination sometimes frustrate make necessary reservations ahead time local hotels likely refer local car taxi service save significant stress pack wisely trip make list things may need bring check pack better ensure leave behind things need pack night leave earlier avoid stress rush give opportunity remember pack things may otherwise forget keep things may need ready transit carry bag stow rest items check luggage reduce chance get hold security point passengers use dress flight days past know important dress comfort travel sure wear comfortable shoe rush airport walk car may need park far away also sure wear clothe comfortably move mind wear day wear layer travel somewhere cold climate warm airplane cold arrive take vitamins get quality sleep night trip stress relievers hand decrease chance get sick stress travel germs circulate air airplane nothing stress see carefully plan trip get sideline case sniffle worse allow ample time flight reduce stress find park check bag move security aspects travel much stressful rush end early read book listen music take walk airport get exercise leave get hold process get plane least spend energy worry miss flight eat healthy meal get airport help reduce stress several ways avoid buy expensive airport food rely flight meal sometimes dubious nutritional value taste worry much blood sugar level become imbalanced travel affect mood get overwhelm breathe exercise progressive muscle relaxation quick stress relievers help feel calm quickly rather think stressful hassle think adventure least challenge right attitude preparations travel much less stressful put metal items like key carry bag rather pocket empty pocket pass airport metal detector travel early day earlier flight less likely delay bring distraction interest new book delay long flight opportunity relax

If you’ve been taking care of a chronically ill spouse or elderly parent, you may be feeling the effects of caregiver stress. If you’re feeling frustrated or overwhelmed or are experiencing increased stress symptoms, you’re not alone. Providing this type of care can place a great deal of pressure on a person, and caregivers are often surprised by the amount of stress they feel. Here are just some of the pressures that many caregivers face.
 
If you’re in the position of caring for someone with cancer or another serious disease, you’re probably also dealing with concerns for your loved one’s future. If you’re caring for a child with special needs, there may be uncertainty as to how to proceed. Being in the position of being a caregiver usually carries some heavy responsibility and sometimes scary situations.
 
If you’re caring for an elderly parent, it can be difficult to see someone who’s traditionally been in the role of caring for you to be now in need of help, often for basic activities like getting dressed or driving. When caring for an ill spouse, roles are often affected as well. This can take a toll on all parties involved.
 As a caregiver, it might be difficult to see your loved one in such a vulnerable position, and it’s often hard for those needing the care to be feeling so helpless. 
As doctor bills and other treatment, fees accrue, and as less energy is left for work, caregivers often find themselves facing financial pressures as well.
 
When dealing with the needs of someone who requires constant care, a caregiver can feel isolated from the rest of the world. Whether you’re in a position where it’s unsafe to leave your loved one alone, or even if they just get lonely when you leave, you may find yourself much more tied to the house than before, which can make it more difficult for you to get exercise, connect with others, and do the things that help you take stress off.
 
While caregivers may feel isolated from others, it’s also common to have very little time alone. The need for solitude is very real for most people, and the stress of getting little time alone can feel confusing for someone who also feels isolated, but both feelings can coexist with caregivers, causing their stress to multiply.
 
Many caregivers find themselves giving round-the-clock care, or spending virtually every free moment attending to the needs of their loved one. Others find that their responsibilities are less constant, but never know if they’ll be needed at one particular moment or the next, so they feel like they need to be constantly available. The feeling of being ""always on duty"" can take a heavy toll on a caregiver.
 
Sometimes the responsibility and feelings of isolation can be overwhelming, and caregivers feel burned-out. Sometimes feelings of guilt accompany such feelings, as though they’re a sign of disloyalty. There may also be guilt if a caregiver feels they're not making their loved one as comfortable as they could be, even if there's really nothing else that can possibly be done. Feelings of frustration are understandable, but guilt is still common.
 
These are just a few of the stressors that caregivers commonly feel, and many people may feel that their stress levels are excessive and that they must not be handling things as well as they should. You are facing significant pressures, and stress is a natural reaction. Especially if you’ve been in a caregiver role for quite a while or face a great deal of responsibility as a caregiver, and it’s important to find an outlet for your stress.
 
While it may be difficult to find the time, energy and resources to take care of yourself, it’s important to make self-care a priority. You will need to learn about stress relief and caregivers and tips on how to manage stress to avoid caregiver burnout.

Here are our best tips for managing conflict, tension and anger. After all, to be a safe and predictable person for those around you at work and at home, it is essential that you are able to maintain your composure when you feel like your buttons are being pushed. This strength will help you to achieve your goals in business as well as your goals for your personal relationships. 
 
E-mails, answering machine messages, and notes are too impersonal for the delicate nature of negative words. What feels like a bomb on paper may feel like a feather when delivered in person. 
 
This phrase will support your goals when the tension is high and you need to find common ground to form compromises or agreements with the other party. 
 
Resist the temptation to defend yourself or to ""shut down"" the other person's communication. It will take this kind of discipline to become an open, trusting communicator. 
 
 It is often much more useful to make a request than to share your anger. For example, if the babysitter is driving you crazy by leaving dirty dishes in the sink, it is better to make a request of them than to let your anger leak out in other ways such as by becoming more distant. 
 
This mirroring technique can keep both the speaker and the listener 'centered' in a difficult conversation, especially when the attitude of the person doing the mirroring is to gain an understanding of a different point of view. 
 
Notice when 'blameshifting' begins to leak into your speech. ""I feel angry when you are twenty minutes late and you don't call me"" is much better than, ""You make me so mad by being late."" 
 
If you can listen and respond in this way you will bring peace and solutions to the conflict more quickly. For example, in response to an employee's raise request, you might say, ""On the one hand, I understand that you really need the raise, and on the other hand, I represent the company, whose funds are very scarce at this time. Is there a way that I can work on your compensation package that does not involve cash?""
 Taking a mediator's point of view can help you look for the creative compromise that takes into account the limits and the needs of both parties.  
You could view maintaining self-control in a tense, angry conversation as an athletic feat. You could also view developing this skill as similar to working out at the gym with weights—the more that you use your self-control muscle the bigger it will grow and the easier it will be to remain calm when tension is great. 
 
As time passes, you will be able to be more objective about the issues and to sort out the truth about the situation more clearly. 
 
If you give yourself permission to blow up, people will not feel safe around you. They will feel that you are not predictable and will carry 'shields' when they are near you. The fear and walls of others will not support your goals for success in relationships or at work.

Aromatherapy, for example, is a known stress reliever, and peppermint essential oil is said to wake up your brain.﻿﻿ Playing classical music as you study can also soothe you and help you learn (unless you find it distracting).﻿﻿ 
 
Consider what would make a good study environment for you. Each individual is different, so what works for someone else might be less than ideal for you. 
 
Learning style theories suggest that people learn information in different ways. You may find it helpful to determine whether you are more of a visual, kinesthetic or auditory learner, as you can tailor your study practices around your particular learning style and make success easier to attain. 
 
Visualizations and imagery are proven stress management techniques.﻿﻿ You can also reduce student stress and improve test performance by imagining yourself achieving your goals.
 
Take a few minutes each day and visualize, in detail, what you'd like to happen, whether it’s giving a presentation without getting nervous, acing an exam, or something else that will support your success. Visualization and guided imagery are the most effective when you can use all of your senses to create a vivid image. Then work hard and make it happen.
 
It has been proven that optimists—those who more easily shrug off failures and multiple successes—are healthier, less stressed, and more successful.﻿﻿ While some level of optimism is inborn, optimism is a state that can be practiced, and your overall levels of optimism can increase as a result. Positive self-talk is a great way to start developing a stronger sense of optimism. 
 
Develop the traits of optimism and you'll do better in your studies and your future career.
 
If you want your performance to be optimum, you need to be well-rested. Research shows that those who are sleep-deprived have more trouble learning and remembering, and perform more poorly in many areas.﻿﻿ You can also be more reactive to stress when you are sleep-deprived, so there are many reasons to focus on getting quality sleep each night. 
 
Students are notoriously busy and sleep-deprived, so you may need to go against the grain at times in order to protect your sleep schedule, but it will be worth it both now and in the future. Work your schedule so you get enough sleep, or take power naps.
 
When you know and practice specific study skills, your entire school experience becomes easier. Learning to stay focused on tasks and organized with your study schedule, for example, can enable you to get more done when you study.
 
Many of these skills transfer to productivity skills in your career, so they are important to know. Here are some more specific study skills and techniques that can help you improve your performance. 
 
Chronic stress can impair your ability to learn and remember facts as well;﻿﻿ stress management is one of the most important—and most overlooked—school necessities. Some effective stress management techniques include breathing exercises, taking a walk, exercising, and journaling.
 
Making relaxation techniques, or stress management techniques, a part of your daily routine can help your overall health and wellness and will help decrease the likelihood of going into a state of chronic stress.
 
A regular stress management practice can reduce your overall stress level and help you to be prepared for whatever comes. The more you identify and practice techniques that work for you now, the more prepared you will be to cope with the challenges you face throughout your life.

Many students deal with stress in college — which can be a significant factor in the dreaded 'Freshman 15'. In fact, due partially to stress, a surprisingly high percentage of college freshmen don’t go on to graduate. What accounts for this stress? The following are common college stressors:
 
Not surprisingly, the workload of college is significantly more involved than the high school workload, and it comes with less hand-holding from parents and teachers. With challenging classes, scheduling issues to coordinate, difficult tests and other academic obstacles, coupled with the most independent nature of the college learning structure, many new and returning students find themselves studying long, hard hours.
 
While college freshmen face the most obvious social challenges that usually involve leaving one’s entire support structure behind, creating a new social network, dealing with being away from home for the first time and finding less parental support, most students face social stress. Finding and living with a roommate, balancing friends with school work (and often part-time jobs), and dealing with the dynamics of young adult relationships can all be difficult, and these challenges can lead to significant stress.
 
There are also many miscellaneous stresses that often come from college life. Many students keep crazy hours from staying up late to study, getting up early for classes, and trying to cram in all the work and fun that can possibly fit. Often the logistics of living more independently—from laundry to car insurance—can cause stress. New students deal with missing home and more seasoned students may wonder if they’re in the right major.
 Most students struggle with who they are and where they’d like to be, at least at some point in their college career. 
What effect do these issues have on students? Just as everyone deals with stress in a unique way, college students experience a range of consequences from stress, from mild to severe. Here are some of the common effects of stress:
 
One of the most commonly felt consequences of college stress is a feeling of being overwhelmed. While trying to find a balance of how hard to work (and play), many college students struggle with perfectionism or unhealthy habits like heavy drinking.
 
Partially because of stress and partially because of other social and practical issues faced by college students, many struggles with their weight. Many gain 10-20 pounds around their first year (weight gain known as the Freshman 15), and others lose weight unintentionally or struggle with eating disorders.
 
You may be surprised to hear that roughly 50% of American students who enter college don’t end up graduating! (According to U.S. Census figures, 6-in-10 high school seniors go on to college the following year, but only 29% of adults 25 and over had at least a bachelor’s degree.) Certainly, finances and life circumstances play into that figure, but the stress of college life cannot be ignored as a factor as well.
 
Because of these factors — and because college is supposed to be enjoyed, not endured — it’s important to keep college stress under control. The article on college life stress relief can provide you with resources to keep these years more relaxed, productive and just plain fun.

Relationships can be wonderful buffers against stress, but relationship conflicts can cause considerable emotional pain and stress. Knowing how to apologize—and when—can repair damage in a relationship, but if you don't know how to apologize sincerely, you can actually make things worse.
 
Effective apologies are simple if you know what to say. Here are some easy steps to help you learn how to apologize sincerely and effectively.
 
When you've made a mistake or hurt another person, there are many good reasons why you should apologize. By apologizing, you are able to:
 
A sincere apology can also bring relief, particularly if you have guilt over your actions. An apology alone doesn't erase the hurt or make it OK; it does establish that you know your actions or words were wrong and that you will strive harder in the future to prevent it from happening again.
 
Not apologizing when you are wrong can be damaging to your personal and professional relationships. It can also lead to rumination, anger, resentment, and hostility that may only grow over time.
 Research suggests that some of the major reasons why people don't apologize are that they aren't really concerned about the other person, apologizing threatens their own self-image, or they believe that an apology won't do any good anyway.  
Knowing when to apologize is as important as knowing how to apologize. Generally speaking, if you suspect that something you did—on purpose or by accident—caused someone else hard feelings, it's a good idea to apologize and clear the air.
 
If what you did would have bothered you if it was done to you, an apology is clearly in order. If you're not sure, an apology offers you the chance to ""own"" mistakes you made, but re-establish what you think was okay. If you feel the other person is being unreasonable, a discussion may be in order. You can decide where you stand on the apology after that.
 
While a sincere apology can go a long way toward mending a relationship, people are often unwilling or unable to take this step. Admitting you were wrong can be difficult and humbling.
 
Researchers have found that people who believe that personality is changeable are more likely to apologize for harmful actions.﻿﻿ Because they feel that change is possible, they feel that accepting the blame for their mistakes is an opportunity for learning and growth.
 
Taking responsibility means acknowledging mistakes you made that hurt the other person, and it's one of the most important and neglected ingredients of most apologies, especially those in the media.
 
Saying something vague like, “I’m sorry if you were offended by something I said,” implies that the hurt feelings were a random reaction on the part of the other person. Saying, “When I said [the hurtful thing], I wasn’t thinking. I realize I hurt your feelings, and I’m sorry,” acknowledges that you know what it was you said that hurt the other person, and you take responsibility for it.
 Don't make assumptions and don't try to shift the blame. Make it clear that you regret your actions and that you are sincerely sorry. 
When seeking to understand how to apologize effectively, it’s also important to understand the value of expressing regret. Taking responsibility is important, but it’s also helpful for the other person to know that you feel bad about hurting them, and wish you hadn’t. That’s it. They already feel bad, and they’d like to know that you feel bad about them feeling bad.
 
These are all expressions of regret that add to the sincerity of your apology and let the other person know you care.
 
If there’s anything you can do to amend the situation, do it. It’s important to know how to apologize with sincerity, and part of the sincerity of an apology is a willingness to put some action into it.
 
If you broke something of someone’s, see if you can replace it. If you said something hurtful, say some nice things that can help to generate more positive feelings. If you broke trust, see what you can do to rebuild it.
 
Whatever you can do to make things better, do it. If you’re not sure what would help, ask the other person what you can do to help them to feel better.
 
One of the most important parts of an apology—one of the best reasons to apologize—is to reaffirm boundaries. Healthy boundaries are important in any relationship. 
 
When you come into conflict with someone, usually there is a boundary that is crossed. If a social rule is violated or trust is broken, an apology helps to affirm what kind of future behavior is preferred.
 
Discussing what type of rules you both will adhere to in the future will rebuild trust, boundaries, and positive feelings, and provides a natural segue out of the conflict, and into a happier future in the relationship.
 
Remember that when you apologize, you're taking responsibility for your part of the conflict. That doesn't mean that you're admitting that the entire conflict was your fault. People are often afraid to apologize first because they think whoever apologizes first is ""more wrong"" or the ""loser"" of the conflict.
 
Giving an apology even when only a small part of the conflict was your responsibility is okay, and often healthy. It allows you to establish what you regret your own actions but confirms your own boundaries as well.
 
It's important to be fair in your apology, both to the other person and to yourself. Don't accept all the blame if it isn't all your fault.
 
When you apologize for just what you did, you can more easily move forward and put the conflict behind you, regardless of the other person's actions. When we apologize, we're able to more easily maintain the integrity and forgive ourselves.
 
The other person may be moved to apologize for their actions as well. While getting an apology is often nice, it is important to remember that this doesn't always happen. Trying to evoke an apology from the other person is a manipulative tactic that sometimes backfires.
 Apologize for your own peace of mind and the other person may be inspired to do the same. Just don't apologize just because you expect an apology in return. 
Although apologizing can be a way to maintain the integrity and move on from actions we're not proud of, most of us also want to repair the relationship and be forgiven. Sometimes this doesn't happen.
 
If the apology was sincere and included the necessary ingredients, your chances of forgiveness are greater, but sometimes the other person just isn't ready or able to forgive and move on. Or they may forgive you, but still, be guarded. Or they may not realize their own role in the conflict. Realize that you can't control their response, and if you've done everything you can, let it go for now.
 
Apologies are not always easy, but that can be an important part of mending or maintaining important relationships. With empathy, an open heart, and a dose of courage, you can take the steps you need to make a sincere and honest apology.
 Acknowledge that you were wrong. Discuss what is allowed and not allowed in your relationship. Express your regret and remorse. Learn from your mistakes and find new ways of dealing with difficult situations. Open up a line of communication with the other person. “I wish I could take it back.” “I wish I had been more thoughtful.” “I wish I’d thought of your feelings as well.”",relationships wonderful buffer stress relationship conflict cause considerable emotional pain stress know apologize repair damage relationship know apologize sincerely actually make things worse effective apologies simple know say easy step help learn apologize sincerely effectively make mistake hurt another person many good reason apologize apologize able sincere apology also bring relief particularly guilt action apology alone erase hurt make establish know action word wrong strive harder future prevent happen apologize wrong damage personal professional relationships also lead rumination anger resentment hostility may grow time research suggest major reason people apologize really concern person apologize threaten self image believe apology good anyway know apologize important know apologize generally speak suspect something purpose accident cause someone else hard feel good idea apologize clear air would bother apology clearly order sure apology offer chance mistake make establish think okay feel person unreasonable discussion may order decide stand apology sincere apology long way toward mend relationship people often unwilling unable take step admit wrong difficult humble researchers find people believe personality changeable likely apologize harmful action feel change possible feel accept blame mistake opportunity learn growth take responsibility mean acknowledge mistake make hurt person one important neglect ingredients apologies especially media say something vague like sorry offend something say imply hurt feel random reaction part person say say hurtful thing think realize hurt feel sorry acknowledge know say hurt person take responsibility make assumptions try shift blame make clear regret action sincerely sorry seek understand apologize effectively also important understand value express regret take responsibility important also helpful person know feel bad hurt wish already feel bad like know feel bad feel bad expressions regret add sincerity apology let person know care anything amend situation important know apologize sincerity part sincerity apology willingness put action break something someone see replace say something hurtful say nice things help generate positive feel break trust see rebuild whatever make things better sure would help ask person help feel better one important part apology one best reason apologize reaffirm boundaries healthy boundaries important relationship come conflict someone usually boundary cross social rule violate trust break apology help affirm kind future behavior prefer discuss type rule adhere future rebuild trust boundaries positive feel provide natural segue conflict happier future relationship remember apologize take responsibility part conflict mean admit entire conflict fault people often afraid apologize first think whoever apologize first wrong loser conflict give apology even small part conflict responsibility okay often healthy allow establish regret action confirm boundaries well important fair apology person accept blame fault apologize easily move forward put conflict behind regardless person action apologize able easily maintain integrity forgive person may move apologize action well get apology often nice important remember always happen try evoke apology person manipulative tactic sometimes backfire apologize peace mind person may inspire apologize expect apology return although apologize way maintain integrity move action proud also want repair relationship forgive sometimes happen apology sincere include necessary ingredients chance forgiveness greater sometimes person ready able forgive move may forgive still guard may realize role conflict realize control response everything let apologies always easy important part mend maintain important relationships empathy open heart dose courage take step need make sincere honest apology acknowledge wrong discuss allow allow relationship express regret remorse learn mistake find new ways deal difficult situations open line communication person wish could take back wish thoughtful wish think feel well

Not all stress is the same. Some of the stress that we face in life can be more detrimental to our well-being, and some types of stress can actually be healthy for us. For example, chronic stress—the type of stress that seems to be constant and psychologically or emotionally draining—is the most harmful to our health and wellbeing.﻿﻿ This kind of chronic stress can trigger the stress response and keep it triggered for long periods of time, leaving us exhausted and close to burnout.
 
Eustress, on the other hand, can be beneficial and is actually necessary for our overall wellbeing. This is the type of ""positive"" stress that keeps us vital and excited about life.﻿﻿
 
The excitement of a roller-coaster ride, a scary movie, or a fun challenge are all examples of eustress. The anticipation of a first date, the first day at a new job, or other exciting firsts also fall under the umbrella of eustress.
 
Eustress is a type of stress that is actually important for us to have in our lives. Without it, we would become bored at best and, in more serious cases, depressed. We would begin to feel a lack of motivation to accomplish goals and a lack of meaning in life without enough eustress. Not striving for goals, not overcoming challenges, not having a reason to wake up in the morning would be damaging to us, so eustress is considered 'good' stress. It keeps us healthy and happy.
 
Understanding eustress can help us to more easily manage other types of stress as well. For example, research shows that when an event is perceived as a ""threat,"" we respond to it differently than if it's seen as a ""challenge.""﻿﻿ Threats tend to elicit a greater stress response from us and create greater levels of anxiety.
 
Challenges, on the other hand, can be exciting, and even enjoyable to overcome. Threats are scary, while challenges are opportunities to prove ourselves and learn how much we're capable of accomplishing when we really try. This understanding reminds us that we can view many of the stressors in our lives as challenges rather than threats merely by changing how we talk to ourselves about the challenges and by focusing on the resources we have to handle these challenges rather than focusing on what may go wrong and how damaging that would be.
 
When we work on shifting our focus and approaching stress as a challenge whenever possible, we can manage these challenges more easily and have more vital energy to handle these stressors, without a feeling of being overwhelmed or unhappy. Trying to approach various stressors in life as we'd approach eustress enables us to manage that stress more easily.
 
That said, while eustress doesn't generally carry the same type of damage as chronic stress, too much eustress can still tax your system. Just as a schedule can become overloaded and stressful even if the events are all ""fun"" activities, you can feel overloaded and stressed by too much eustress if you're not allowing yourself to return to a relaxed state and have a healthy balance of restorative downtime. Hence why it's balance is essential. A balance between work activities and fun activities is important, but a balance of eustress and leisure is also an important focus.
 
Changing one's perspective can certainly help with stress management, but it's not the only strategy that should be used. If you have too many challenges in your life, even eustress can become chronic stress and lead to burnout or worse.
 
It's important to be mindful of where your limitations are and to work to maintain balance in your life. This can mean cutting out any unnecessary obligations (particularly ones that you don't enjoy), adopting some resilience-promoting habits that can help you to be less reactive to stress overall, and become comfortable with saying no to new activities if they won't truly serve you. This takes practice but it can make all the difference in your stress levels.

With more and more people in the world--and particularly in the workforce, our roads are becoming increasingly crowded. Inside our cars, it's easy to feel isolated from the world and forget that there are other people with different priorities. That can cause us to be far less polite to one another while driving than we would be if we met in person and had to face each other on a more personal level. Additionally, when we’re all frustrated with traffic, sometimes people make mistakes or pull impolite driving maneuvers, which can lead to anger from other frustrated drivers and create a cascade of hostility. This often results in road rage, which can pose a significant threat to health and safety for everyone on the road.
 
Road rage and hostile driving may be common, but that doesn't make it safe. Obviously, road rage may make us more prone to accidents, However, there are other risks as well; people experiencing road rage may face increased health risks that come from high levels of stress, tension, and anger. These episodes of acute stress may become chronic stress, which leads to many negative health outcomes.
 In addition to the toll stress takes on the ""rager's"" body, the increased risk of a car accident due to road rage puts all drivers at risk. 
Moreover, some incidents have become violent as a result of everyday road rage that escalated out of control. 
 
By being a courteous and defensive driver, you can cut down the level of frustration you might cause other drivers, doing your part in keeping road rage at bay. But if you yourself experience road rage, here are some techniques you can use to stay calm in the car:
 
Experiment with these techniques and others from The Tension Tamers Section, and you should find your driving time to be more pleasurable, and your commutes safer.
 Breathe: Breathing exercises can help you cleanse your body of stagnant air and stale energy, getting your blood more oxygenated and, of course, releasing tension. Focusing on your breathing brings your attention inward and makes frustrations seem more removed, without taking your focus too far away from the road. Listen: Listen to music or audiobooks. Music can subtly color your experiences, adding an exciting soundtrack to your commute. Audiobooks can supply you with a mild distraction that can make your drive enjoyable enough that you find annoying drivers and bumper-to-bumper traffic less frustrating. Relax: Practice Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and Deep Muscle Relaxation (DMR). When you’re frustrated, you store the tension in your body. These techniques will help you learn to quickly release the tension you’re carrying, even as you sit in the car, which will help you feel more physically and emotionally relaxed. Play: Use cognitive-behavioral interventions like Counting Idiots. Basically, if you accept that a certain amount of people are going to make fools of themselves on the road, and decide to make a game out of counting them, you can cut down on the stress you feel in response to their rude maneuvers. Plan: Manage your time wisely. Often, when we’re frustrated on the road, it’s because we’re in a hurry and can’t get there quickly enough because of traffic. Organizing your schedule so you can leave earlier, and planning for traffic, can leave you feeling more relaxed because it really won’t matter as much if the trip takes a few extra minutes.",people world particularly workforce roads become increasingly crowd inside cars easy feel isolate world forget people different priorities cause far less polite one another drive would meet person face personal level additionally frustrate traffic sometimes people make mistake pull impolite drive maneuver lead anger frustrate drivers create cascade hostility often result road rage pose significant threat health safety everyone road road rage hostile drive may common make safe obviously road rage may make prone accidents however risk well people experience road rage may face increase health risk come high level stress tension anger episodes acute stress may become chronic stress lead many negative health outcomes addition toll stress take rager body increase risk car accident due road rage put drivers risk moreover incidents become violent result everyday road rage escalate control courteous defensive driver cut level frustration might cause drivers part keep road rage bay experience road rage techniques use stay calm car experiment techniques others tension tamers section find drive time pleasurable commute safer breathe breathe exercise help cleanse body stagnant air stale energy get blood oxygenate course release tension focus breathe bring attention inward make frustrations seem remove without take focus far away road listen listen music audiobooks music subtly color experience add excite soundtrack commute audiobooks supply mild distraction make drive enjoyable enough find annoy drivers bumper bumper traffic less frustrate relax practice progressive muscle relaxation pmr deep muscle relaxation dmr frustrate store tension body techniques help learn quickly release tension carry even sit car help feel physically emotionally relax play use cognitive behavioral interventions like count idiots basically accept certain amount people make fool road decide make game count cut stress feel response rude maneuver plan manage time wisely often frustrate road hurry get quickly enough traffic organize schedule leave earlier plan traffic leave feel relax really matter much trip take extra minutes

While many burnout risk factors have to do with job structure and lifestyle factors, certain personality characteristics can exacerbate your experience of stress, making you more susceptible to burnout.
 
While much of personality is inborn, it’s important to be aware of how your personal makeup and tendencies can contribute to your stress response, so you can adjust what you can. The following personal characteristics can affect your stress level and put you at an increased risk for burnout.
 
Striving to do your best is a sign of a hard worker and can be a positive trait that leads to excellence. However, perfectionism can cause excessive stress and sometimes be crippling.
 Perfectionists beat themselves up if everything isn’t perfect, whereas hard workers tend to be happy with a near-perfect job well done. 
Perfectionists sometimes won’t even try to accomplish a task because they’re too terrified of ""failure""—which can be defined as anything less than perfect!
 
If you’re a perfectionist, you should practice forgiving yourself for being human, and congratulate yourself for being great (even when you’re human).
 
Pessimists tend to see the world as more threatening than optimists. They worry more about things going wrong, expect more bad things to happen than good, believe in themselves less, and have other key differences compared to optimists.
 
Pessimists cause themselves unnecessary stress in many everyday situations, which can make them more vulnerable to burnout. Fortunately, optimism can be learned to a certain extent.
 
Some people are just naturally more excitable than others. They have a stronger and more easily triggered stress response. These differences can be observed in very young babies and tend to be stable over a person’s lifetime.
 
There’s not much you can do to change your body’s chemistry, but you can practice tension relieving strategies that can help you calm down when you do get stressed.
 
You can also practice positive self-talk strategies, which will help you perceive situations as less threatening.
 
You’ve probably heard of a ""Type A"" personality, but did you know that people with the personality type may be more at risk for cardiac disease and other health issues?
 The two cardinal characteristics of ""Type A"" personality are time impatience and free-floating hostility. 
Being a ""Type A"" personality (or even just working closely with someone who is) can cause chronic stress, which increases your risk for burnout.
 
If you find yourself being impatient with people and life’s minor hassles and having trouble keeping from lashing out at people, you might be a ""Type A"" personality.
 
Are you detail-oriented or do you look at the overall big picture? Do you tend toward extroversion or are you more comfortable away from lots of people? Do you like structure or prefer flexibility?
 
If your life’s work requires skills that fit your strengths, you're more likely to feel happy with what you do. However, if your personality doesn’t mesh with your job description, you will feel stressed much of the time and be more likely to burn out.
 
Not sure if you and your lifestyle are a good match? There are several online tests that you can use to reveal your inborn strengths and weaknesses, understand how your personality characteristics differ from those of your friends and colleagues; and see how well your preferences and talents match up with your job.
 
Some jobs are poorly compensated, but supply great rewards in terms of making a difference in the lives of others and making the world a better place. For those who believe in what they’re doing, stress is less of a factor; however, if you don’t believe in your life’s work, it’s harder to put up with the difficulties that come with it.
 
Whether you’ve become disillusioned with your job, you went into your field for the wrong reasons, your values conflict with those of a company you work for, or you never really believed in what you were doing in the first place, if your life’s work conflicts with your values, the cognitive dissonance created by doing something you don’t believe in day after day can take a toll and lead to an increased risk for burnout.

Tests can be stressful even for the most prepared students, and often the brightest and most committed students can experience the most stress before an exam. Unfortunately, test anxiety can actually have a negative impact on your performance, even among gifted students and high achievers, and particularly among perfectionists. (Just having that knowledge adds to the stress, doesn’t it?)
 
Well, fear not: there are several steps you can take before an exam and even during it that can minimize the pressure you feel, maximize the sense of confidence you have, and make your stress levels much more manageable.
 While tests may never be fun and non-stressful, they can be far easier to take once you have test anxiety under control and are armed with tools for battling it. 
The following test anxiety busters can help you get through your next test with much greater ease—and likely more success!
 
Getting 6 hours or less can put you into what’s called a sleep deficit, or lack of sufficient sleep. Having a sleep deficiency can actually make you less sharp mentally, which can negatively affect your performance on tests, even if you spent those missed hours of sleep studying. So it’s very important for you to get all of your studying done so you can get a good night of sleep before your big day. 
 
Being organized with your studies can help you keep from pulling all-nighters to get all of your studying in and blowing the test because you’re exhausted (see above). How do you study ‘smarter’? Make a list of the most important things you need to learn, in order of importance, and hit the items at the top of the list first. (That way, if you run out of time, you’re mostly covered.)
 
Make a list of all the work you have to do, estimate how much time each item will take, and compare that with the number of hours you have available; this will tell you if you can carefully read (or just skim), how many times you can afford to revise papers and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done. (If you’re pressed for time, it’s important to check your perfectionist tendencies at the door.) Oh, and turn off the t.v. as much as possible until your tests are behind you.
 
A great way to build your confidence as you fall asleep each night is to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully. Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you’re really experiencing something, and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to ‘practice’ success in a way that can actually help you perform better. (Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.) Visualizations can also help you to remember facts: you can create detailed scenarios that involve the information you’re trying to remember, and this can help cement the facts in your memory.
 
Because stress can impair your memory, it’s important to stay calm before and during tests. While that’s easier said than done, there are several stress relief techniques that can help you calm down quickly whenever you feel overwhelmed. For example, breathing exercises have been shown by research to reduce test anxiety, and can be extremely effective in helping you relax and reverse your stress response in a variety of situations: just take deep breaths, expanding your belly on the inhale, and let the stress come out with your exhales.

Of course, you've heard about stress and may have even experienced a good amount of it already today. But do you know what the difference is between ""stress"" and ""stressors?"" Stressors are situations that are experienced as a perceived threat to one’s well-being or position in life, especially if the challenge of dealing with it exceeds a person’s perceived available resources.﻿﻿
 
When one encounters stressors, the body’s stress response is triggered, and a series of physiological changes take place to allow the person to fight or run. If this sounds like stress, it's because sometimes when people talk about ‘stress’ in their life, they are really talking about stressors; stressors lead to the body’s stress response and the experience of stress. The important thing to remember, basically, is that stressors are the cause of stress.
 
What situations are stressors? That can vary from person to person. While some things tend to stress many people—job demands, relationship conflicts, a hectic schedule—not every potential stressor causes stress for everyone.
 Each person has different stressors because each of us has a unique set of resources, understanding of the world, and way of perceiving things. What seems like a threat to one person may be perceived as a challenge to another. 
Sometimes these differences can go unnoticed—it may not occur to you that a trip to the mall can be a stressor, but to someone who hates crowds and shopping, an afternoon at the mall can be a significant stressor. Even to someone who enjoys shopping, but has an introverted nature can become stressed by a long shopping trip that would be an enjoyable or even exhilarating experience for someone who is a strong extrovert. You may even be one of those people who hates crowds and comes home from a shopping trip not fully realizing why you feel stressed.
 
Other times, you can notice and even change whether something hits you as a stressor or as a simple experience in your day. You can choose to look at things differently, a technique that is known by psychologists as cognitive reappraisal, and you can empower yourself by becoming more aware of what you can control in the situation, and you can build up your resilience to stress so that fewer things are experienced as stressors.﻿﻿ Or you can work to eliminate the stressors in your life that can be avoided.
 
While it would be impractical to eliminate all stress (and because certain types of stress, such as eustress, are actually good for you, you wouldn't want to, anyway), it is important to be able to minimize stressors in your life and deal with the stress that you do experience—what’s known as stress management.
 
An important first step is to begin thinking of stress as something that you can and should learn to manage, just as you'd take any other problem head-on. For now, here are some targeted resources for managing the stress from specific stressors:
 
Begin managing your stressors today by identifying the things that cause you stress in ""real time,"" that is, become aware of how you feel throughout the day by paying attention to your body as well as your mind. If there's something that you dread in your life, begin to think why, troubleshoot what you can, and develop habits to build resilience when you can't arrange things as you'd prefer them. Ultimately, any minimized stress is a good thing.
 Top Causes of Stress: Are you stressed by the same things that are stressors to most people? Here are some of the top causes of stress (and how to manage them). Job Stress and How It Affects You: Certain job factors are significant stressors to most people. How does your job measure up and how can you manage the stress?

Welcome to the holiday season—that whirlwind of gift-giving holidays, marketing blitzes, holiday parties, and activities galore that begins right after Halloween, builds to Thanksgiving and continues gaining momentum through the end of the year.
 
While this season is meant to bring feelings of love and cheer, it’s also the harbinger of holiday stress for many. In fact, according to a poll conducted on this site, more than 80% of us find the holiday season to be ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ stressful—that ranks navigating the holidays right up there with asking for a raise! What is it that has us all so hot and bothered?
 
All things in moderation, as the saying goes. The problem with the holiday season is that we often experience too much of a good thing. While stress itself is necessary for our survival and zest for life (researchers call this positive type of stress ""eustress""), too much stress has a negative impact on our health, both mental and physical. Too many activities, even if they are fun activities, can culminate in too much holiday stress and leave us feeling frazzled, rather than fulfilled.
 
An overabundance of parties and gift-giving occasions lead many people to eat, drink and be merry—often to excess. The temptation to overindulge in spending, rich desserts or alcohol can cause many people the lasting stress of dealing with consequences (debt, weight gain, memories of embarrassing behavior) that can linger long after the season is over. Also, in these more difficult financial times, finding affordable gifts can be stressful in itself, and carrying holiday debt is a tradition that too many people unwittingly bring on themselves, and the stress that comes with it can last for months.
 
The holidays are a time when extended families tend to gather. While this can be a wonderful thing, even the most close-knit families can overdose on togetherness, making it hard for family members to maintain a healthy balance between bonding and alone time. Many families also have roles that each member falls into that have more to do with who individuals used to be rather than who they are today, which can sometimes bring more dread than love to these gatherings.
 
For those who don’t have these family issues, loneliness can be just as much of a problem. As the world seems to be gathering with family, those who rely more on friends for support can feel deserted and alone.
 
An often unrecognized problem that comes with the holiday season is actually a by-product of the seasons changing from fall to winter. As daylight diminishes and the weather causes many of us to spend more time indoors, many people are affected to some degree by a type of depression known as seasonal affective disorder.﻿﻿ It’s a subtle but very real condition that can cast a pall over the whole season and be a source of stress and unhappiness during a time that people expect to feel just the opposite.
 
The great thing about holiday stress is that it’s predictable. Unlike many other types of negative stress we encounter in life, we know when holiday stress will begin and end, and we can make plans to reduce the amount of stress we experience and the negative impact it has on us.
 
Here are some tips you can try to help reduce holiday stress before it begins so that it remains at a positive level, rather than an overwhelming one.
 
Before you get overwhelmed by too many activities, it’s important to decide what traditions offer the most positive impact and eliminate superfluous activities. For example, if you usually become overwhelmed by a flurry of baking, caroling, shopping, sending cards, visiting relatives and other activities that leave you exhausted by January, you may want to examine your priorities, pick a few favorite activities and really enjoy them, while skipping the rest.
 
If you can’t fathom the idea of skipping out on sending cards, baking, seeing people, and doing all of the stuff that usually runs you ragged, you may do better including all of these activities in your schedule, but on a smaller scale.
 
Send cards, for example, but only to those with whom you maintain regular communication. Or, don’t include a personal note or letter in each one. Find a way to simplify. The same goes for the baking—will anyone be enraged if you buy baked goods from the bakery instead? If you find ways to cut corners or tone down the activities that are important to you and your family, you may enjoy them much more.
 
During the holidays, we may want to look and feel great (especially if we're around people we don't see often—we know that this is how we'll be remembered), but there is so much temptation in the form of delicious food and decadent desserts, and a break from our regular routines—plus the addition of emotional stress—can all add up to overeating, emotional eating, and other forms of unhealthy eating. This year, plan ahead by being aware of your triggers, do what you can to have some healthy food at hand for each meal, be aware of your intake, and practice mindful eating. The resource below will provide more in-depth information on how to successfully do these things and more.
 
With family and friends, it’s important to be aware of your limitations. Think back to previous years and try to pinpoint how much togetherness you and your family can take before feeling negative stress. Can you limit the number of parties you attend or throw or the time you spend at each? Can you limit your time with family to a smaller timeframe that will still feel special and joyous, without draining you?
 When dealing with difficult relatives, it’s okay to set limits on what you are and are not willing to do, including forgoing your visits or limiting them to every other year. 
For those who experience loneliness during the holidays, consider inviting a group of friends to your home. If virtually everyone you know is with family during the holidays, you might consider volunteering to help those less fortunate than yourself. Many people report these experiences to be extremely fulfilling, and your focus will be on what you have rather than what you lack.
 
Putting your plans on paper can show you, in black and white, how realistic they are. If you find a time management planner and fill in the hours with your scheduled activities, being realistic and including driving time and downtime, you will be able to see if you’re trying to pack in too much. Start with your highest priorities, so you will be able to eliminate the less important activities. Be sure to schedule in some time to take a walk in nature each day if at all possible, as exercise and exposure to daylight can drastically reduce or even eliminate the symptoms of SAD. (If climate or other factors prohibit this, try to find some time to sit by a window and look out; several minutes of exposure to natural light, even if through a window pane, can help.)
 
This sounds like a no-brainer, but sometimes we forget to take deep breaths and really give our bodies the oxygen we need. It's great if you can take ten minutes by yourself to do a breathing meditation, but merely stopping to take a few deep, cleansing breaths can reduce your level of negative stress in a matter of minutes, too. If you visualize that you are breathing in serenity and breathing out stress, you will find the positive effects of this exercise to be even more pronounced.

Political elections these days have become quite intense — we have very passionate participants on both sides, and with so much passion on both sides, the side of the candidate who did not win inevitably feels disappointment and stress from having things go the other way. It's important for a nation to be united and move forward after a fiercely fought campaign, and it's important for voters to feel better and less stressed about the results if the results weren't what they hoped for. Here are some strategies for relieving stress about an election.
 
Many people got used to checking 24-hour news channels and websites and staying abreast of every turn in the campaign over the past several months. Now that the election has happened, you may start realizing that it was all a bit overwhelming. If you feel a little overwhelmed, try to limit your news exposure, or go on a ""news fast"" for a few days, to give yourself a break.
 
While taking a break from the news, you may also want to expose yourself to new scenery that reduces stress: Take a walk with your family in the evening, go to an exercise class (exercise is a great stress reliever), or try some guided imagery for a ""quick"" change of scenery. You’ll be glad you did.
 
People have already been volunteering and getting involved with the political campaigns in high numbers. Now that the campaigns are in the past, you might enjoy volunteering for a worthy cause that’s important to you. Doing something with your stressed energy can help you deal with your anxiety, give you a sense of control (read here about the benefits of gaining an internal locus of control), and take your mind off the stress of your candidate not winning.
 
Having your candidate not win can be very disappointing. As with other situations where you experience anxiety but have no power to directly change your circumstances, one thing you can do to reduce stress is to change our outlook.
 While you don’t have to be enthusiastic about the other candidate winning, you can reduce the anxiety you feel about the situation by changing what you focus on. 
You already know what you don't like about the other candidate, but you might feel better if you looked for qualities or possibilities that you can feel good about — nobody agrees or disagrees with 100% of another person's views and policies, so chances are good that there are some positives for you in this situation as well. If you look and still can't find anything about this outcome that doesn't feel terrible to you, it might help you feel better to focus on other things in life that bring you happiness, like friends and family. (See this article for more on changing your perspective with cognitive restructuring.)
 
It can be very cathartic to talk to friends and family who agree with your political views. Get together and talk about your disappointment, and you may feel better just getting your feelings out; you'll also feel supported and understood. Sometimes just sharing your feelings through journaling helps you to let go. If you find that your feelings are so intense that they're interfering with your regular functioning, you may even want to talk to a professional.
 
Stress is stress. Whether your stress comes from election fears or something else, it’s important to have some standard stress relievers you have up your sleeve to keep your current stress from morphing into chronic stress, where your stress response gets triggered and never quite gets turned off. Some of my favorites are breathing exercises, regular exercise, meditation, social support, and journaling.

January is considered one of the most stressful months of the year for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that so many people are partaking in New Year’s resolutions.
 
While resolutions to live a more healthy lifestyle and give up negative habits can be wonderful in the long term, certain types of resolutions and strategies for meeting resolutions can create stress for those making the changes, at least in the first few weeks. The third through the eighth week after an attempted change can be the most stressful, as motivation wanes and challenges crop up.
 
These resolution situations can also be stressful for co-workers and loved ones exposed to the potential moodiness of overly stressed people. The following are some of the top New Year’s resolution stressors, plus tips on how to handle related stress and stick to your goals.
 
As a former smoking cessation counselor, I can attest to the stress that comes from the early days of quitting smoking. In addition to the nicotine withdrawal, which is felt in varying levels by different people, the stress of making this lifestyle change is felt almost universally, at least to some degree.
 
This is because many people who smoke use the habit as a primary coping device; when they feel stressed, they smoke to feel better.﻿﻿ Therefore, when they can’t use smoking to cope with the stress of not smoking, it becomes an escalating spiral of stress. Therefore, it becomes even more important to have a few stress relievers on hand to cope with the stress of those early quitting days, when relapse is most likely.
 
This will make success much easier, and make less stress for everyone. In addition, expert Terry Martin has these excellent tips for dealing with nicotine withdrawal.
 
Losing weight is a very popular New Year’s resolution, and it's usually a great idea for overall health as well as for the fun of fitting into better clothes. However, especially with certain types of diets, the first days of a new diet can bring frustration (from feeling ""deprived"" of favorite foods), moodiness (from biological changes in your body), and the loss of a coping mechanism (for emotional eaters who can no longer eat to deal with the stress).
 It can be as stressful to be around a new dieter as it can be to be a new dieter, so stress management is key here as well. 
No matter what the specific change you’re attempting, New Year’s resolutions can be stressful if tackled with the traditional method of setting a high goal and trying to attain it immediately. (For example, “From now on, I will exercise every day for one hour,” or “From now on, I will keep the house spotless.”)
 
This is because it’s difficult to make changes in habits, period. It’s even more difficult to make big changes with no mistakes, and resolutions worded in the aforementioned typical format allow no ""wiggle room""—no space for setbacks.
 
When people fail once, they tend to give up. This makes keeping resolutions an exercise in perfectionism, which can be stressful for anyone. If you’d like to maintain resolutions with less stress, create a different format for your goals. Take baby steps, build in rewards for your progress, and make a few other minor changes and you will see greater success with less stress.

The holidays present many wonderful opportunities to bond with family, but this time of year can also present significant stress, particularly when family conflict arises. Some conflict can come from having to decide which relatives to see if any.
 
Here are some ways to divide up your time over the holidays and handle conflicts and holiday stress that may arise.
 
If you and your spouse both want to celebrate with your families of origin, if you're dealing with a divorce situation where not everybody wants to celebrate together or if you just have a lot of family, it can be stressful deciding who to see, and when. Taking turns is an easy solution. If you see one group in November, see the other in December, or alternate years. Then you can eventually see everybody.
 
If the stress of traveling each year is more than you'd like to handle, you may want to have family over to your home for the holidays. This is also a good solution when you have too many groups or relatives to take turns seeing: invite everyone to celebrate together, and you will get to see everyone more often.
 While hosting the celebration at your home may not work in every situation, it can help to build bonds between groups of relatives that may not know one another very well. 
If you usually have conflict when you get together with your family, it's a good idea to be prepared for it. I'm not suggesting that you go looking for trouble, but rather, approach the situation with a sense of realism. If your mother always criticizes your appearance or your brother always makes rude jokes, don't expect them to change their habits; just aim to have a sense of humor about it and remind yourself what you love about them.
 
If seeing family causes you great amounts of stress each year, it's okay to say no sometimes. Celebrating with just your partner or kids can be a wonderful alternative to seeing people who make you feel consistently stressed.
 
Many a happy holiday has been formed by groups of people who have decided to celebrate with friends instead of family. Whether you're unable to travel (or have family who is), or for some other reason find yourself without kin, celebrating with other people you know who are also without family for the day can be a great way to bond with friends and enjoy the spirit of the season.

Virtually everyone experiences loneliness from time to time, with many people becoming especially aware of feelings of loneliness around the holiday season, Valentine’s Day, and during times of extreme stress.
 
While the sheer number of people who experience loneliness is quite large (a poll on this site shows that holiday loneliness is experienced by a surprising proportion of readers, for example), people don’t always talk about feelings of loneliness and don’t always know what to do with these feelings.
 
Other than being emotionally painful, loneliness can affect people in many ways:
 
If you’re experiencing loneliness, there are some things you can do about it.
 
Whether it’s an art class, an exercise class, or a class at your local community college, joining a class automatically exposes you to a group of people who share at least one of your interests.
 It can also provide a sense of belonging that comes with being part of a group. This can stimulate creativity, give you something to look forward to during the day, and help stave off loneliness. 
Becoming a volunteer for a cause you believe in can provide the same benefits as taking a class — meeting others, being part of a group, creating new experiences — and also brings the benefits of altruism, and can help you find more meaning in your life, both of which can bring greater happiness and life satisfaction, as well as decrease loneliness.
 
Additionally, working with others who have less can help you feel a deeper sense of gratitude for what you have in your own life.
 
Because loneliness is a somewhat widespread issue, there are many people online who are looking for people to connect with.
 
You do have to be careful of who you meet over the internet (and, obviously, don’t give out any personal information like your bank account number), but you can find real support, connection, and lasting friendships from people you meet online.
 
You probably already have people in your life that you could get to know better, or connections with family that could be deepened. If so, why not call friends more often, go out with them more, and find other ways to enjoy your existing relationships and strengthen bonds?
 
Pets, especially dogs and cats, offer so many benefits, and preventing loneliness is one of them. Rescuing a pet combines the benefits of altruism and companionship, and leaves you with several loneliness-fighters.
 
It can connect you with other people — walking a dog opens you up to a community of other dog-walkers, and a cute dog on a leash tends to be a people magnet. Additionally, pets provide unconditional love, which can be a great salve for loneliness.
 
Research has shown that loneliness and depressive symptomatology can act in a synergistic effect to diminish well-being, meaning the more lonely you are, the more depressed you feel, and vice versa.
 
It’s also been found that people experiencing loneliness tend to feel more lonely than others when with other people, meaning that even when they are with other people, lonely people tend to keep their loneliness to a degree. Because of this, sometimes just ""getting out there"" and meeting other people isn’t enough.
 
If this is the case for you, it may be a good idea to seek psychotherapy to help with feelings of loneliness, especially if you also feel symptoms of depression, such as a loss of enjoyment doing things you used to enjoy.
 
Some forms of therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can help you to change your thoughts as well as your actions to help you not only experience less loneliness but do more in your life to prevent loneliness. Whatever you do to combat loneliness, know that you are truly not alone, and there are many things you can do to feel more connected.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with a mental health condition, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

Depression: One study found that lonely people showed more depressive symptoms, and lonely and depressed people alike tended to experience less ""togetherness"" in social interactions. Research has also found that depression and loneliness can feed off of each other, each perpetuating the other.﻿﻿ Physical health: Several studies have linked emotional stress with depressed immunity. Other research links loneliness and depression with poorer health and well-being.﻿﻿ That means that people who are experiencing loneliness are susceptible to a variety of health issues.

Noise pollution is any intrusive noise that disrupts, distracts, or detracts from regular functioning. While we often think of noise pollution as a problem of big cities, with the competing sounds of more people in a smaller space, noise pollution can also be found in suburban neighborhoods (in the form of leaf blowers, lawnmowers, and home construction) and even individual homes and workplaces. And there is a great deal of scientific research to show that noise causes stress and can have a negative impact on your health and productivity.﻿﻿
 
While there are many different sources of noise pollution, these, in particular, have been found to have a negative impact on health.
 
Noise pollution from airplanes has a significant negative impact on the health and well-being of those who live close to airports.﻿﻿ This can include heart disease, high blood pressure, and elevated stress hormones, as well as sleep disruption.﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
One of the complaints of those who live in big cities or on busy streets is the disruption from the sounds of traffic. Interestingly, though, even low levels of traffic noise can be damaging. Traffic noise is one of the most commonly experienced sources of noise pollution, and research has tied it to depressive symptoms along with cardiovascular and respiratory-related deaths﻿.﻿﻿
 
Most of us may think of loud assembly lines or construction sites when we think of noise pollution in the workplace, and while these examples definitely apply, regular offices are not immune. With more people packed into busy office spaces, office noise is a common complaint. Co-workers who talk, drum their fingers on the desk, or offer other distracting noises can decrease the productivity of those around them without realizing it.
 
Many people don’t think of their homes as noisy, but if there’s a lot of activity in the home, including a constantly running TV, this overall noise level can actually be a threat to concentration and a cause of stress. In fact, children from more noisy homes do suffer ill effects that include less cognitive growth, delayed language skills, increased anxiety, and impaired resilience.﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
Perhaps the most serious problem created by sound pollution is the impact it has on health. Because sound pollution can trigger the body’s stress response, one of its major health effects is chronic stress and the high levels of stress hormones that go with it.﻿﻿
 
That explains why noise pollution has been linked with heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. Noise pollution can also impact sleep quality by preventing sleep and disrupting sleep cycles. And, perhaps most significantly, because chronic stress can lower your immunity to all disease, noise pollution is a general threat to health and wellness.

The holiday season is generally thought of as a time of joy and love, but for far too many people, it’s a time of loneliness. Some people live far from family and miss seeing their loved ones this time of year; others dread going to holiday parties and New Year’s Eve celebrations without a partner and end up staying home. It’s also common for people to feel emotional distance from the people they’re with, thus feeling lonely even if they’re in a room full of people.
 
For those who feel a sense of loneliness, holidays can be a time of additional stress, including those like Valentine's Day or even Independence Day.﻿﻿ The following suggestions can help.
 
While this may not completely erase feelings of loneliness, taking special care of yourself can help you to feel better and enjoy your solitude more. Whether you take a relaxing bath and give yourself spa treatments, curl up with a good book, enjoy a hobby, or learn something new. Taking time to do things that will enhance your self-esteem or at least give you a good dose of fun will not only take your focus off of feeling alone, but it can lift your spirits as well.
 
While you may be feeling alone in your life right now, knowing that the holidays can be a lonely time for many people may help you to feel less so.﻿﻿
 
Many people wish they could be with family, but can’t; others mourn the relationships with family that they wish they had, that they see others enjoying during the holidays season. Likewise, many people long for closer connections with friends, or wish for a supportive romantic relationship, and find themselves feeling isolated during the holidays.﻿﻿
 
While it may be uncomfortable to feel lonely, it’s also OK to feel this way. Talking to others who may share your feelings (either via the internet or in real life) can help you to feel less alone in your situation.
 
Part of why holidays feel more lonely for many people is that our society has high expectations for this time of year. The absence of a romantic partner or a close family rarely seems more uncomfortable than during this flurry of expected social activity when we’re all supposed to be going to parties and exchanging gifts and enjoying jolly feelings with loved ones.
 
One way to deal with the feelings of loneliness is to rethink your expectations. Realize that few people’s lifestyles truly measure up to “movie standards” of perfect living, and shift your focus to all the great things you do have in your life. Social media can create significant amounts of stress in this area.
 
Realizing that it's just fine to take a good friend (instead of 'the perfect date') to a holiday party, or that the flawed love of a difficult family member still counts as love, has helped many people feel less lonely.
 
You may feel lonely when surrounded by people, but it’s harder to feel lonely when you’re reaching out to them.﻿﻿ Whether you’re saying hello to neighbors you’re usually too rushed to acknowledge, exchanging friendly words with people at the office, or picking up the phone and calling an old friend you haven’t spoken to in a while, reaching out to people and strengthening bonds can help you feel more connected and less lonely.
 
This may be a time to message people over social media whose statuses you usually simply ""like,"" and catch up on old friendships.﻿﻿
 
There are many far-reaching benefits to gratitude. One easy antidote to feelings of lack is to cultivate feelings of gratitude for what you already have; it's hard to focus on both at once.﻿﻿ If you're feeling a lack of love in your life, make a concerted effort to focus on the love that you do have--from friends, family, neighbors, and even pets. You can also focus on things you really value in your life, like your work, the hobbies you have, or even your potential.
 Maintaining a gratitude journal can be a wonderful exercise in cultivating an attitude of gratitude, and can leave you with a written record of everything you have to value in your life, to read through when you're feeling down. 
One particularly meaningful way to feel less lonely during the holidays is to donate your time to a cause you believe in.﻿﻿ Helping others who are less fortunate than you can fill you with feelings of love and pride, remind you of all you have to be grateful for, and even connect you with others who share your passion. You’ll be part of something larger than yourself, and you’ll be immersing yourself in the true spirit of the holiday season.
 
This one probably won’t make you feel better immediately, but if you feel lonely much of the time, this may be a cue that some changes are in order for the coming year. You may want to examine what’s behind your feelings of loneliness, either on your own or with the help of a therapist.
 
Would you benefit from putting more time into your social life so that you have stronger relationships? Is something inside of you causing you to keep people at a distance? If you’d like to deepen your friendships, it can cost a little extra time and energy, but the payoff is having increased support and feelings of being heard and understood. Making time for friends, truly listening when your friends talk, and being there for them are all ways to build supportive friendships.﻿﻿
 
If you feel burdened by feelings of loneliness or feel them throughout the year and find it difficult to deal with, you can also talk to a professional about how you feel; this can often be more helpful than people expect.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with loneliness or depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

As parents of young adults, we’re all too familiar with stress, but our kids suffer from it too. Stress rates among teens and young adults have spiked in recent years and it's no wonder. Junior and senior year of high school and the lead-up to college applications are prime time for stress overload. So are the first few weeks of college, the weeks of midterms and lead-up to final exams. There may be a day or two of stresslessness in there somewhere, but who can tell?
 
When that late night phone call comes from a child who’s freaking out, the last thing they want to hear is a lecture on the importance of doing your homework and planning ahead. Instead, here's a list of things you can advise that may offer immediate relief:
 
Cutting back on sleep may seem like a good way to eke out a few more hours for exam cramming, but missing even a few hours of sleep two or more nights in a row can result in sleep deprivation. Concentration drops, memory function is impaired, and the brain turns foggy and sluggish – hardly the optimal conditions for studying.
 There’s a clear connection between the amount of sleep a student gets and his GPA, and studies have shown that morning owls perform better academically. 
So tell your frantic child to set the alarm for 7 a.m., plan on doing some hardcore – and vastly refreshed – studying then and get some sleep now.
 
If thoughts are racing through your child’s brain with such velocity that he can’t sleep, tell him to make a list. We’d all love to have a Pensieve, the magical basin Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore used to hold memories and thoughts when they threatened to overwhelm his brain, but a to-do list works nearly as well.
 
Brains need nourishment. Eating a balanced diet that’s heavy in protein and complex carbohydrates, as opposed to donuts, beer, and someone else’s Ritalin, makes a huge difference in one’s body’s ability to cope with stress and perform well. Keep that in mind when sending your college child an exam week care package too.
 
Tell him to work on the most critical or difficult courses or projects first, when his brain is fresh. Too much work? Tell him to look at his schedule and eliminate the non-essentials. Remind him that the world will not stop if he tanks a test.
 
Studying with a group quells panic. It lets students play to their own strengths, and maximizes and organizes study time. Plus, the companionship helps soothe frayed nerves.
 
Go for a run, take a nap – but no more than 20 to 30 minutes and no later than mid-afternoon. Make an exam worry doll and let it do the worrying.

Do you ever feel like some of the techniques that are recommended for the management of stress only work for certain people in specific situations? For example, if you find yourself in a high-pressure situation like a conflict at work or a toddler's tantrum, is it really practical to meditate for stress relief at that time? If you find yourself out of a job and grappling with the interview process, is laughter really the best medicine? How can you know which stress relief techniques will work for you, and when to use them? Read on for guidelines that can outline what works and when so that next time you're facing stress, you have the right tool for the job!
 
If you’re feeling overwhelmed in the moment, these quick stress relievers can work quite well. While more in-depth stress relief techniques may bring more lasting and far-reaching benefits, these will help you to quickly reverse your stress response so you can better manage what you are facing right now:
 
Stress can come from many aspects of one's lifestyle. Often it helps to address the stress at its source, but that's not always a possibility.
 When you can, take action; when you can't change your situation, you can still minimize the stress you feel by cutting out stressors, building resources and adding stress relieving habits to your lifestyle. 
The following ideas can help.
 
Certain stressors, such as relationship issues, hit you emotionally. This type of stress can feel particularly trying, so it is important to find techniques to manage emotional stress. The following techniques can help you to process your emotions, minimize their intensity, or shift your focus.
 
Fears and anxiety about tomorrow can create stress and rob us of our happiness today. That said, anxiety is rather common, and finding stress relief techniques to combat it can help us to relax into the present moment and enjoy life more. Certain types of anxiety are intense enough to require professional help, but everyday anxiety can be managed well with a few stress relief strategies. These techniques can help.
 
Stress management is particularly important during times of crisis. Certain strategies, such as taking care of your physical health, tend to be particularly important during these times because they can be particularly helpful, and can affect the other ways in which you cope.
 
Virtually all stress management techniques become more effective over time, as your body and mind become used to relaxing as you practice them. Certain techniques, particularly exercise and meditation, are especially effective at creating changes that help you to become more resilient toward stress with practice over time. Practicing stress management techniques in an ongoing way can help you to relieve stress as you face it, and be more ready for whatever stress comes your way. These stress management resources can help you to make stress management a regular part of your life. Also, be sure to keep in mind that if the stress you face requires more than what these techniques alone can offer, you can talk to your doctor about other options and support.
 Breathing Exercises (1 to 5 Minutes): Breathing exercise can work quickly and be used virtually anywhere and in any situation. I find them especially helpful because they can be used in the midst of a stressful situation. There's no need to take a break from things, calm down, and return after you've practiced them--you can use these to stay calm in the middle of a toddler's tantrum or whatever else comes your way. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (3 to 5 Minutes): PMR takes a little practice to master, but can help you to fully relax your body in minutes, and release stress in the process. You may need to take a break to practice in the beginning, but eventually, this can be a helpful exercise to use at your desk, in the car, or whenever you find 5 minutes to sit. Mini-Meditation (3 to 10 Minutes): Regular meditation works extremely well as a stress reliever for most people, and 20-30 minutes is an optimal length for a session. Mini-meditations, however, can be useful as well, particularly if you are used to longer sessions practiced at other times. Even three minutes of meditation can help you to feel calmer. Take A Walk (10 Minutes): If you are able to get out and walk for a minute, the change of scenery and a quick burst of exercise can work together in helping you to quickly relieve stress. This can be helpful for stressed moms and kids, as well as workers who are under heavy pressure and need to make the most of the short breaks. Change Your Perspective (Varies): Sometimes you can't change what you are facing, but you can change the way you look at things. Shifting your perspective to a more optimistic one, or even simply finding the humor in a situation can help to dissipate stress. Cut Something Out: If you're stressed from a busy lifestyle, an obvious solution is to cut down on your commitments. That's often easier said than done, but once it's done, you have a whole category of stress gone from your life. Look at ways of cutting something out, and see what you open yourself up to. Take Up A New Habit Certain habits help with organization or resilience. Taking on these habits can help you to better manage the stress you face. Let Go Of Negative People: Friends and loved ones make our lives richer. Sometimes, though, the drama and conflict they create can bring more than a comfortable level of stress. Identify the people in your life who make you feel worse about yourself, drain your energy, or in other ways bring more stress than they're worth, and consider minimizing or eliminating their role in your life. Change Your Habitual Thought Patterns: The way we think about what we face in life can increase or decrease our stress levels. Be sure your thoughts are supporting you to manage stress in the healthiest possible way. If they're not, these tips can help you to change that. Carve Out Time For Yourself: Having some extra ""down time"" can be one of the best stress relievers, particularly for those who don't get enough. This is because, just like an overused muscle, we need rest in between workouts. If we are constantly running, there is no time to recover and build energy for the next challenge, even if that challenge is simply part of daily life. This can lead to burnout. Be sure to create some space for relaxation in your life, so you can continue to push yourself when you need to. Journaling: Journaling can be a very effective tool in managing stress and exploring and processing your emotions. These techniques work particularly well for working through emotional stress. Meditation: Meditation can be challenging when you have a lot on your mind, but this is also a time when it can be most effective. The loving kindness meditation is particularly useful for relieving emotional stress and can be one of the easier forms of meditation to practice. Mindfulness meditation may take a little more practice but does not require a distraction-free space. Experiment and see which types of meditation work best for you and your situation. Exercise: Exercise can be a great distraction--running, walking, classes and other forms of exercise provide a change of scenery as well as something to focus on with your mind and body besides your stressors. Exercise provides health benefits and builds resilience toward stress as well, so it is an option that works in many ways. Change Your Perspective: As mentioned, the way we perceive things can increase or decrease the stress we feel. Sometimes we see things in a more negative or distorted way than we need to, and learning to change this can bring relief to our stress levels and our relationships. That's why it helps to examine and change cognitive distortions we may have. If you can shift the way you look at the situation, you may experience less emotional stress. Talk To A Friend: Simply sharing your thoughts with a friend can help you to feel less alone, and can provide you with another perspective. Wisely choose who you speak to, and be sure to reciprocate when your friends need your support but don't underestimate the power of a supportive shoulder. Meditation: Meditation is a fantastic anxiety reliever, as it helps you to quiet (or learn to ignore) that nagging voice in your head that points out everything you could be but shouldn't be worrying about. Luckily, there are many different forms of meditation to try. See which types of meditation work best for you. Journaling: Often, we worry about things that pose no real threat, things that have a low likelihood of happening, or things we can't control. Sometimes we need a reality check. Journaling can offer a helpful tool for examining and refuting the sources of anxiety. Action-Based Coping: There are often things you can do to change a situation, but sometimes our anxiety keeps us from moving into action mode. Other times, it may ease anxiety to build resources that we may need if the worst does indeed happen. Either way, brainstorming solutions can be quite helpful, and this journaling technique can walk you through the process. Talk To A Friend: Friends can often provide a reality check or they can point us to resources that can help us to feel less concerned about what might happen next. Even talking to someone about how they may have faced similar situations in the past can help us to feel less anxious about the stressors that cause us anxiety. Talking to a friend or, if necessary, a therapist can provide helpful support.",ever feel like techniques recommend management stress work certain people specific situations example find high pressure

When thinking of ways to reduce stress in life, usually techniques like meditation, yoga, and journaling come to mind. These are great techniques, to be sure. But getting a new best friend can also have many stress relieving and health benefits. While human friends provide great social support and come with some fabulous benefits, this article focuses on the benefits of furry friends: cats and dogs.
 
Research shows that, unless you’re someone who really dislikes animals or is absolutely too busy to care for one properly, pets can provide excellent social support, stress relief, and other health benefits—perhaps more than people. The following are more health benefits of pets.
 
For those who love animals, it’s virtually impossible to stay in a bad mood when a pair of loving puppy eyes meets yours, or when a super-soft cat rubs up against your hand. In addition to the social support, stress relief, and general health benefits pets can bring, research supports the mood-enhancing benefits of pets. A 2017 study found that those with AIDS were less likely to suffer from depression if they owned a pet.﻿﻿
 
Yes, it’s true. While ACE inhibiting drugs can generally reduce blood pressure, they aren’t as effective in controlling spikes in blood pressure due to stress and tension. Research has concluded since the mid-1980's that there are positive physiological effects, especially lowered blood pressure, to petting dogs and social interaction with companion animals. Touch, the actual act of petting the dog, appeared to be the major component of the so-called pet effect.﻿﻿
 
Whether we walk our dogs because they need it, or are more likely to enjoy a walk when we have companionship, dog owners do spend more time walking than non-pet owners, at least if we live in an urban setting.
 
Most people with dogs will likely tell you that they enjoy their walks more because of the companionship of their pets, and perhaps even the feeling of being part of a community of other pet lovers. Because exercise is good for stress management and overall health, owning a dog can be credited with increasing these benefits.
 
When we’re out walking, having a dog with us can make us more approachable and give people a reason to stop and talk, thereby increasing the number of people we meet, giving us an opportunity to increase our network of friends and acquaintances, which also has great stress management benefits.﻿﻿
 
Pets can be there for you in ways that people can’t. They can offer love and companionship, and can also enjoy comfortable silences, keep secrets, and are excellent snugglers. And they could be the best antidote to loneliness.
 
In fact, one study found that nursing home residents reported less loneliness when visited by dogs alone than when they spent time with dogs and other people.﻿﻿ All these benefits can reduce the amount of stress people experience in response to feelings of social isolation and lack of social support from people.
 
While we all know the power of talking about your problems with a good friend who’s also a good listener, research shows that spending time with a pet may be even better.
 
One study showed that, when conducting a task that’s stressful, people actually experienced less stress when their pets were with them than when a supportive friend or even their spouse was present.﻿﻿ This may be partially due to the fact that pets don’t judge us; they just love us.
 
It’s important to realize that owning a pet isn’t for everyone. Pets do come with additional work and responsibility, which can bring its own stress. However, for most people, the benefits of having a pet outweigh the drawbacks. Having a furry best friend can reduce stress in your life and bring you support when times get tough.

Most people don’t’ realize how much clutter causes stress, but it’s true that living in a mess can drain you of time, energy, and even money, creating significant amounts of additional stress. Unfortunately, a cluttered home is the norm. But while stressed, overscheduled people have little time to clean, given the value of having your home as a sanctuary from stress, as well as what you save by being organized, it makes sense to keep your house clean.
 
The key is to be smart about cleaning, and clean in a way that causes little additional stress, or actually help you reduce stress while you clean. There are many specific tips on how to declutter a space or an entire home, but one important aspect of cleaning that shouldn't be overlooked is keeping things low-stress and as enjoyable as possible so you don't mind the chore. If you're able to do this, you'll be more likely to clean on a more regular basis and this can reduce the stress of cleaning as well.
 
The following low-stress housekeeping tips can help you do all of this:
 
There are many proven benefits of music for stress relief, and music is even used to promote wellness in the form of music therapy.﻿﻿ Music can actually calm you down or energize you, depending on what type of music you choose. You can harness the stress-relieving and energy-inducing powers of music to help your cleaning efforts so that you’re actually less stressed (or at least no more stressed and tired) when you’re finished, plus you’ll get a boost from the great feeling you get from your cleaner space.
 
Toss or donate everything that you don’t need or love. Find a place for everything that’s left, so it’ll be easier to clean up. And don’t buy new things unless you absolutely need them. These simple guidelines will leave you with less stuff to clutter up your space and make cleaning quicker and easier.
 
When creating new habits of any type, it’s good to make realistic goals, work toward them consistently and reward yourself for even the smallest progress. This is also true for cleaning.
 Breaking down cleaning into chunks of quick daily or weekly tasks can make these chores feel less overwhelming and help you fit cleaning into your day. 
If you set small, doable cleaning goals, such as 30-second chores (a list of chores that can be done quickly so that you can knock a bunch out when you have a few free minutes), or a daily cleaning list (which is a group of lists that cover all chores so that you'll keep your house clean over the course of a week or month if you just do a few a day), you won’t get overwhelmed by the work.
 
Clean a little bit every day, and you just may have the magic formula for a cleaner, stress-free living environment. Further your rewards and keep your motivation up by enjoying your home when your work is done! If you clean your bathroom, give yourself a regular home spa experience so you can really appreciate all of your hard work. Enjoy a candlelit dinner in your kitchen, burn essential oils to enjoy aromatherapy, and decorate in a way that really makes your heart smile. Once you get used to having your home as a sanctuary from stress instead of another cause of it, you’ll probably be hooked!

When looking for ways to manage stress, people often overlook one of the simplest and most effective strategies: create a peaceful home. Because most of our days begin and end at home, having a peaceful home as your base can help you launch yourself into the world from a less-stressed place each day. (Children appreciate this, too!)
 
Because this seems like such a given, why don’t people put more focus on discovering and assembling the elements of a peaceful home? It’s a paradox that many of us experience—even though home is important, the need to take care of the structure and workings of our homes may not seem like as pressing of a need as others we experience day-to-day. When we’re rushing to get out the door in the morning, or collapsing on the couch after a long day, cleaning and organizing may seem like a ridiculous pursuit.
 
However, when you consider the value of creating an inspiring place to wake up to, a soothing place to come home to, and a relaxing place to live, it becomes apparent that time and energy put into creating a peaceful home can translate into energy saved and stress relieved. Here are a few more reasons to create a peaceful home.
 Maintaining an uncluttered, peaceful home can make you feel more energetic and relaxed at the same time. 
Now that you know why it's important to maintain a peaceful home, let's cover how. The including several peace-promoting elements in your home can make it a more soothing and enjoyable place to be. When trying to convert your home into a more peaceful space, consider the following elements of a peaceful home.
 
These are the classic activities people think of when they think of home makeovers. Getting rid of clutter can help you plug up energy drains all over your home. Organizing your things can help you to know where everything is, and have a place to put everything in your home so that clean-up goes very quickly. Decorating, using colors and themes that truly speak to you, can help you feel relaxed and energized at the same time as you look around and take in the beauty, order, and style of your home.
 
One of the challenges of maintaining stress-relieving habits is that we get busy and let other activities in our lives come first. If we build in a physical space for our stress-soothing habits, we have a physical reminder, as well as a facilitator, to help us maintain the motivation to keep these habits in our lives.
 
Many people have reaped the stress relief benefits of feng shui and swear by the practice. As you're making changes to create a peaceful home environment, factoring in a little feng shui (or a lot) can bring long-term benefits, as once you incorporate the stress-relieving elements of feng shui, you don't have to constantly maintain most of the changes—they're just part of your decor.
 
Because aromatherapy is getting a lot of buzz these days, it's easy to find products that provide a wonderful, soothing scent for a room. And the hype isn't unwarranted; aromatherapy research shows that there are real stress-relief benefits to its use.﻿﻿ Aromatherapy can help create a peaceful home that subtly offers passive stress relief, making it a recommended element of a peaceful home.
 
Music is another of those wonderful stress relievers that, like aromatherapy, offers passive stress relief, can energize or relax you (depending on the type you use). It can offer benefits that are better than you might imagine. Incorporating music into the background can help contribute to a peaceful home environment—it's a great way to relieve the stress of those you're with, and relieve your own stress at the same time, without much effort.
 The Toll of Clutter: In ways many people don’t realize, clutter has hidden costs. It drains us of time, energy, and even money. Fun With Friends and Family: One clutter-clearing expert, FlyLady, refers to a cluttered environment as living in CHAOS: Can’t Have Anyone Over Syndrome! We love this acronym because it’s so true—who can relax with friends and family in a messy home? Probably not you or your guests! Because of the benefits of social support, and the stress-relieving benefits of having fun with friends, it’s even more helpful to have an environment where everyone can relax and have fun. Raise Your Energy Levels: The eastern practice of feng shui—the ancient art of placement—is gaining popularity all over the globe, as people notice that their surroundings can influence the way they feel and the energy that they have. Feng shui holds that the placement and type of objects in our surroundings can affect our energy or chi. Whether or not you are interested in feng shui, you have probably noticed that cluttered environments can be an energy drain—even if just because there’s so much to look at (and everything you see is a reminder of cleaning that should be done)!",look ways manage stress people often overlook one simplest effective strategies create peaceful home days begin end home peaceful home base help launch world less stress place day children appreciate seem like give people put focus discover assemble elements peaceful home paradox many experience even though home important need take care structure work home may seem like press need others experience day day rush get door morning collapse couch long day clean organize may seem like ridiculous pursuit however consider value create inspire place wake soothe place come home relax place live become apparent time energy put create peaceful home translate energy save stress relieve reason create peaceful home maintain unclutter peaceful home make feel energetic relax time know important maintain peaceful home let cover include several peace promote elements home make soothe enjoyable place try convert home peaceful space consider follow elements peaceful home classic activities people think think home makeovers get rid clutter help plug energy drain home organize things help know everything place put everything home clean quickly decorate use color theme truly speak help feel relax energize time look around take beauty order style home one challenge maintain stress relieve habit get busy let activities live come first build physical space stress soothe habit physical reminder well facilitator help maintain motivation keep habit live many people reap stress relief benefit feng shui swear practice make change create peaceful home environment factor little feng shui lot bring long term benefit incorporate stress relieve elements feng shui constantly maintain change part decor aromatherapy get lot buzz days easy find products provide wonderful soothe scent room hype unwarranted aromatherapy research show real stress relief benefit use aromatherapy help create peaceful home subtly offer passive stress relief make recommend element peaceful home music another wonderful stress relievers like aromatherapy offer passive stress relief energize relax depend type use offer benefit better might imagine incorporate music background help contribute peaceful home environment great way relieve stress relieve stress time without much effort toll clutter ways many people realize clutter hide cost drain time energy even money fun friends family one clutter clear expert flylady refer clutter environment live chaos anyone syndrome love acronym true relax friends family messy home probably guests benefit social support stress relieve benefit fun friends even helpful environment everyone relax fun raise energy level eastern practice feng shui ancient art placement gain popularity globe people notice surround influence way feel energy feng shui hold placement type object surround affect energy chi whether interest feng shui probably notice clutter environments energy drain even much look everything see reminder clean

Want a secret weapon for relieving stress? Getting organized. Putting in the effort of getting organized, especially if this organization extends to multiple areas of your life, can help reduce stress levels long term by requiring less last-minute scrambling in a variety of everyday situations. It can also feel empowering, so you experience new situations as ""exciting"" rather than ""stressful,"" which can minimize the strength and duration of your stress response, or keep it from getting triggered in the first place.
 
However, getting organized is more difficult than it initially sounds. For example, how organized must you be? When do you know when you’re ‘organized enough’? (Do your clothes need to be hung according to color, or alphabetically? Must every minute be scheduled and accounted for in a calendar somewhere?) And what are the most important areas of life for getting organized?
 
The following tips for getting organized cover how organized to be, what areas carry the greatest benefits, and how to get started:
 
A cluttered home can subtly drain you of energy; that much is pretty common knowledge.﻿﻿ However, there are other hidden costs of clutter as well. (Clutter can drain your finances and schedule, too.) That’s why it’s important to organize your home. While you don’t need to have your books alphabetized or your shoes lined up according to the date you bought them, it is important to have everything in its place and have that place be somewhere that makes sense. There are a variety of ways to maintain an organized home.
 
Do you find yourself constantly rushing? Does your mind race with all that you have to do? And do you have trouble remembering it all? If so, you already know that living like this can be pretty stressful, don’t you? Getting organized with your time can make a huge impact on your life: Your to-do list can all get done, and it can stop occupying your thoughts.﻿﻿
 
In getting your schedule organized, remember a few important things. First, don’t overbook yourself. Plan only as many activities as you have time for. Also, be aware of what you need to get done and when—in a way other than keeping it all in your head. (I recommend David Allen’s Getting Things Done for a cohesive time management plan.) Finally, schedule in some downtime. If you’re always running, running, running, you may be less efficient overall because you’re tired of all the running. Schedule in some downtime, and you can really focus the rest of the time.
 
Yes, you may consider being proactive with your problems to be part of getting organized in that it's a tendency to be organized with your approach to stress, which can be quite empowering. It’s important to notice and eliminate patterns of stressors so that your stress response isn’t constantly triggered. For example, if you’re having trouble with your kids, don’t just face each situation like it’s happened for the first time; try to notice patterns of behavior and address those patterns, so they won’t keep happening. (I like to call that ‘getting organized with discipline.”) If you find yourself constantly stressed in traffic, try to pinpoint why, and address those issues.
 
You can be organized in your life in a host of ways. These are three of the main ones. Give them a try, and start feeling less stressed today.

Clutter—most of us have a little of it here or there. In fact, many of us have more than just a little. In a survey conducted by the National Association for Professional Organizers in 2015, it found that over a third of readers were overwhelmed by their clutter —and don’t know where to begin cleaning.﻿﻿ (In contrast, less than 10% say their homes are clutter-free.) How is all this mess affecting us?
 
People often think of clutter as an energy drain, but it also drains us of our time. How? People in cluttered homes spend extra time, virtually every day, looking for lost items, such as keys, money, shoes, tools, etc. Even when we’re looking right at the lost item, it becomes difficult to see when surrounded by clutter. And the extra time it takes to search through the mess adds up quickly.
 
When we don’t have financial papers organized, bills can get lost, causing us to accrue late fees. Replacing lost items and buying duplicates of those we didn’t realize we already had can also carry a cost that adds up quickly.
 The most obvious toll that clutter takes is added stress on one's life.﻿﻿ 
Here are some examples of stress clutter can cause:
 
For most of us, especially for parents of small children, it’s not realistic to maintain a home in perfect order every moment of each day. While it’s inspirational to thumb through catalogs that show beautifully furnished rooms or walk through a wonderfully un-cluttered model home, holding oneself to such high standards of neatness may not only be unrealistic, but it can also cause additional stress.
 
For example, if you find yourself nagging or resenting other family members for the minor messes that they make to the point that it strains family harmony, you may need to relax your standards.
 
But knowing the toll that clutter takes, how much clutter is too much? While we know that piles of clutter can cause stress and a perfect home may be unrealistic for some people, the level of tolerable clutter may vary from person to person.﻿﻿
 
Stress. The first sign you may have too much clutter is the effect it has on your stress levels while at home. It's helpful to remember that you can best appreciate your home when it's a sanctuary for you.
 Can you truly relax in your home or is it an energy drain? 
Company. It can also be stressful to have to do a full cleaning of your home before having any guests over. Do you feel agitated that you can't have someone drop by without worrying about getting everything organized first?
 
Organization. Is your home organized enough that you can generally find everything you’re looking for without having to search?
 
There are many books and even websites dedicated to helping you declutter your home, but there are some basic steps that work well:
 
This can all be done in a day or can be spread out over several weeks in 30-minute increments if you work quickly. If you can only do it in ""baby steps,"" Flylady.net has a good system that can help.​
 As you find places for what you’re keeping, be sure that you’re storing things in a way that makes sense and looks nice. 
Kids’ toys can be stored very neatly in tubs, which provide quick cleanup and keep toy clutter out of sight. Getting drawer organizers for your bathrooms and kitchen can keep drawers from overflowing with extra items. Having a filing system for papers makes it easy to put them away and find them when you need them. Putting a little extra effort into organizing your things now will save you time in cleaning up and maintaining order for years to come.
 
Once you have your home decluttered and organized, you can add a few nice touches that can make your home the ideal haven for you to relax. I strongly recommend that you have a system in place for playing music, as it carries such amazing relaxation benefits. You may also want to have some aromatherapy candles or diffusers out. Home spa supplies are a must for the bathroom and a soothing bedroom can help with sleep. Finally, I would recommend that you create a small space for yourself to use while journaling or for meditation—it may become your favorite part of your home.
 
You may also want to learn to incorporate some of the principles of Feng Shui, the ancient art of placement, to decorate your home in a way that will reduce daily stress and may help you build the type of life you want.
 
Getting your home more organized feels great. However, just as it takes the effort to maintain weight loss over time, a clean house takes a little ongoing effort as well. Fortunately, this effort can be minimized with the help of expert advice. The following are some of the best bits of advice from the clutter-clearing experts:
 Having guests over becomes an embarrassment or an event that takes all-day preparation. Each room carries visual reminders of all the work that needs to be done in the way of cleaning. Using your home for activities like scrapbooking or yoga becomes difficult or impossible without taking significant time to clear the space. According to the principles of feng shui, clutter drains you of your positive energy—you can actually feel it!﻿﻿ A cluttered home, rather than a haven from stress, is a big stressor in itself and intensifies the frustration and exhaustion that an already-stressed person feels. Go room by room and divide your things into four boxes: things to donate, things to throw away, things to keep, and things to store. If you don’t need it or love it, consider getting rid of it. Go through your box of things to keep and find a place for everything. Make it a logical place that’s in the same area where it’ll need to be used. For example, keep keys by the door. Finish one room before moving on to the next. Keep a schedule. This is a wonderfully organized way to maintain a clean house, especially for those who work best when they have a list of ""to-dos"" to follow.  Follow the 30-second rule. Not to be confused with the dubious ‘Five-Second Rule’ (which entails eating food off the ground that’s been there only five seconds), this powerful rule by Sarah Felton of Messies Anonymous goes something like this—if a job takes around 30 seconds or less to do, do it immediately. This applies to putting away your shoes, sorting mail, and other small jobs. Watch your ‘hot spots’. Remember those piles that you just got rid of? Clutter tends to accumulate in the same places—the front door, the kitchen table—little by little each day. Flylady Marla Cilley recommends that you focus on the areas where you tend to leave clutter at the end of each day, so they don’t turn into big piles again. Put your things away. Once you have ""a place for everything and everything in its place,"" you’re ready for this important companion rule. When you take something out, you should simply put it back. Take 15 minutes. Many cleaning experts, including Flylady, recommend that you put on some music and take 15 minutes, a few times a day, to clean. You can get a lot done in 15 minutes and it doesn’t impact your schedule too much to do so. Stop receiving junk mail. One simple way to cut down on paper clutter is to get rid of the junk before it comes in. If you bring something in, get rid of something. Do a light cleaning at the end of every day. Do a more thorough cleaning once a week (or hire someone to do it for you if it fits your budget). Have people over more often and really enjoy your home. Live like you really appreciate your newly beautified haven and you’ll automatically be more likely to maintain it.",clutter little fact many little survey conduct national association professional organizers find third readers overwhelm clutter know begin clean contrast less say home clutter free mess affect people often think clutter energy drain also drain time people clutter home spend extra time virtually every day look lose items key money shoe tool etc even look right lose item become difficult see surround clutter extra time take search mess add quickly financial paper organize bill get lose cause accrue late fee replace lose items buy duplicate realize already also carry cost add quickly obvious toll clutter take add stress one life examples stress clutter cause especially parent small children realistic maintain home perfect order every moment day inspirational thumb catalog show beautifully furnish room walk wonderfully clutter model home hold oneself high standards neatness may unrealistic also cause additional stress example find nag resent family members minor mess make point strain family harmony may need relax standards know toll clutter take much clutter much know pile clutter cause stress perfect home may unrealistic people level tolerable clutter may vary person person stress first sign may much clutter effect stress level home helpful remember best appreciate home sanctuary truly relax home energy drain company also stressful full clean home guests feel agitate someone drop without worry get everything organize first organization home organize enough generally find everything look without search many book even websites dedicate help declutter home basic step work well day spread several weeks minute increments work quickly baby step flylady net good system help find place keep sure store things way make sense look nice kid toy store neatly tubs provide quick cleanup keep toy clutter sight get drawer organizers bathrooms kitchen keep drawers overflow extra items file system paper make easy put away find need put little extra effort organize things save time clean maintain order years come home decluttered organize add nice touch make home ideal relax strongly recommend system place play music carry amaze relaxation benefit may also want aromatherapy candle diffusers home spa supply must bathroom soothe bedroom help sleep finally would recommend create small space use journaling meditation may become favorite part home may also want learn incorporate principles feng shui ancient art placement decorate home way reduce daily stress may help build type life want get home organize feel great however take effort maintain weight loss time clean house take little ongoing effort well fortunately effort minimize help expert advice follow best bits advice clutter clear experts guests become embarrassment event take day preparation room carry visual reminders work need way clean use home activities like scrapbooking yoga become difficult impossible without take significant time clear space accord principles feng shui clutter drain positive energy actually feel clutter home rather stress big stressor intensify frustration exhaustion already stress person feel room room divide things four box things donate things throw away things keep things store need love consider get rid box things keep find place everything make logical place area need use example keep key door finish one room move next keep schedule wonderfully organize way maintain clean house especially work best list follow follow second rule confuse dubious five second rule entail eat food grind five second powerful rule sarah felton messies anonymous something like job take around second less immediately apply put away shoe sort mail small job watch hot spot remember pile get rid clutter tend accumulate place front door kitchen table little little day flylady marla cilley recommend focus areas tend leave clutter end day turn big pile put things away place everything everything place ready important companion rule take something simply put back take minutes many clean experts include flylady recommend put music take minutes time day clean get lot minutes impact schedule much stop receive junk mail one simple way cut paper clutter get rid junk come bring something get rid something light clean end every day thorough clean week hire someone fit budget people often really enjoy home live like really appreciate newly beautify automatically likely maintain

After a long day at the office, the last thing you may want to do to de-stress is to come home and clean the house. Many people associate cleaning more with drudgery than relaxation, for obvious reasons. However, there are several reasons why cleaning can be a great stress reliever.
 
Some of these reasons have to do with the process of cleaning, and some come from the end results of your efforts. Either way, the following information may just make you want to start cleaning the next time you feel stressed.
 
Let’s face it: clutter can be stressful. Walking into a home that has piles of paper on every surface, stacks of laundry needing to be put away, and random items were strewn on the floor feels different than walking into a model home. It’s a difference you can feel viscerally.
 
While most of us want that neat, ordered home environment, far too many of us live in a cluttered one that causes us stress. According to a poll on this site, less than 10% of respondents live in a clutter-free home, and over a third live in surroundings so cluttered that they don’t even know where to begin cleaning. ​
 
If you find yourself late on paying bills (because you can’t find them), replacing items you still have (because you don’t know where they are), and eating out more often than you need to (because your kitchen is too cluttered and messy for regular cooking), a little spring cleaning may actually save you money. You may not even realize the ways that a clean house can also be a money saver until you live in one.
 
Make cleaning a mindful task by taking the opportunity to be thankful for each thing you touch. For instance, if you are washing dishes, admire your plates, be grateful for the food that you're scraping off since some have none, and admire the beauty of modern technology as you place that dish in the dishwasher.
 
By thinking about what you are cleaning you might find an extra appreciation that you didn't realize you were lucky to have before. Because inner peace comes more from wanting what you have than from having what you want, unearthing the wonderful haven beneath the dirt and clutter can bring a new level of gratitude for all that you have.
 
While the end result of a major cleaning session — a beautiful and clean home — can be a great stress reliever, the act of cleaning your house can be a stress management technique in itself. If you incorporate mindfulness into your cleaning, the work can actually be a form of meditation, leaving you more relaxed after you finish.
 
If you’re not one to get into a zen state as you clean, why not go in the other direction, and turn your cleaning experience into a mini party? Music has many wonderful stress relief benefits and playing music as you clean can make the activity much more enjoyable. Play your favorite dance music as you clean, and you may actually work faster and be done sooner.
 
The act of cleaning, if done right, can bring the added benefit of getting you a little extra exercise, which can be great for relieving stress. Running up and down the stairs, carrying items from room to room, and scrubbing windows and floors can burn calories, release endorphins, and help you blow off steam. Spring cleaning is a workout routine that brings many benefits indeed.

People experience plenty of stress from jobs, finances, and other areas of their lives. When we come home, we want to feel like we’re entering a refuge, safe from the demands of life. But does your home provide a safe harbor from stress, or is it causing you additional stress that you might not be aware of? If you have a cluttered, poorly decorated, or somewhat disorganized living space, home relaxation can be virtually impossible.
 
With a little work, your home could be another stress management tool at your disposal. Here’s why.
 
Just sitting in a cluttered room can create stress. Whether you view it in feng shui terms as ""stagnant chi,"" in cerebral terms as too much information for the eye to process, or in practical terms as a visual reminder of how much work you need to do to get your house clean, you probably already know that mess means stress.
 Living in a cluttered home can create constant low-grade stress and subtly but steadily drain your energy. 
Being in a space characterized by order, tranquility, and a physical manifestation of your tastes, on the other hand, can soothe you and help release stress. This is how marketers sell products from catalogs so efficiently. They are really ‘selling’ the sense of peace that comes from the beauty of the picture as much as they’re selling the products contained in that picture of a beautiful room.
 
Coming home to an orderly home can help you feel like you’re entering a sanctuary away from the stresses of the outside world.
 
A messy, disorganized home can cost you more than just your inner peace. If you don’t have a ‘home’ for all of your belongings, you spend more time trying to put things away when you’re cleaning up, and waste time looking for items when you need them.
 
If you don’t have an organized system for filing your bills and other important papers, you may end up paying things late, which results in fees and additional stress. There are many other ways that you don't even realize your mess may be draining your resources.
 
Followers of the Chinese discipline feng shui believe that a well-ordered home aligns vital energy in your life to bring good fortune in other areas of your life. Others simply enjoy the soothing surroundings and pleasing aesthetics that come with the balanced decorating style that feng shui espouses. 
 Whether or not you believe that feng shui brings special good fortune, it’s hard to argue that an organized home wouldn’t bring additional benefits, chief among them being reduced stress. 
Any time is the right time to create an organized, soothing home atmosphere. You can simplify your life and reduce the daily stress you experience by putting in relatively minimal effort to de-clutter, organize, and decorate your home. Let your home be your sanctuary.

Does your current morning routine consist of hitting the snooze button four times and walking out the door five minutes later as you put on your shoes and eat a protein bar, all while checking email on your phone? From that point on, our entire day can feel like we're always trying to rush and catch up, never really feeling on top of our game or very productive. We can do better!
 
Many of us are busy, have a lot of responsibilities and obligations, and often feel strapped for time. Having a great morning routine can make all the difference in being productive, achieving goals, feeling organized, and doing all of this with confidence.
 
It is well known that morning routines can be a deal breaker for people having great, productive days. Particularly in the professional fields of sales and leadership, the development of a solid morning routine can be a dealbreaker in terms of productivity and success.
 
Although not all of us are in sales or a leadership position at work, we are all designed to be leaders of our own lives. This includes giving ourselves the best opportunity for feeling confident and productive each day.
 
Productivity coaches suggest that daily habits can be an indicator of increased productivity and achievement. Although coaches have varied ideas on the types of daily habits to include, most agree that how we begin our day has a tremendous impact on how the rest of the day seems to go.
 
Creating a morning routine is not focused on who can accomplish the most or check off more boxes than everyone else. Instead, it is about allowing yourself to begin your day with confidence, peace, and a positive attitude.
 Starting the day this way can allow us to effectively complete tasks and to handle things that come our way without constantly feeling stressed or overwhelmed. 
According to researchers from Harvard Business School and Stanford University, workplace stress can be as damaging to our health as secondhand smoke.﻿﻿
 
Feeling good, physically, can certainly influence how we feel emotionally. We usually don't walk around having the flu with a smile on our face or being overly optimistic. Our emotional health can be impacted by how we feel we are managing our day.
 
When we are constantly in a rush and trying to make the next appointment, always running behind, or feeling lost in a sea of tasks, we can easily become overwhelmed, stressed, sad, and frustrated. Over time, if this were a continual pattern, it makes sense that we could possibly begin to feel hopeless as if we'll never catch up! A sense of peace and confidence in our day can help us maintain positive emotional health and help us to become much more resilient during times of stress.
 
When we feel overwhelmed and stressed, our emotions can easily show up in our relationships with important people in our lives. How many times have you come home from a long, stressful day and taken your frustrations out on a loved one? This could be through venting, anger, or even isolation from those we love.
 As we start building a morning routine that allows us to feel more confident, productive, and resilient, we might find that our relationships feel closer, more connected, and positive as well. 
The morning routine helps us set the tone for the day, better allowing us to control our schedules rather than our schedule controlling us. As we start each day fresh, we can better focus on what is in front of us, where to prioritize our time, and, ultimately, increase our productivity.
 
Productivity is not always about how much we are getting done but can also refer to the level of quality and intention we are giving to tasks. Finishing the day with 10 half-completed tasks feels a lot different than completing six tasks and feeling proud of the quality of your work. When we are constantly reacting to additional tasks, stressors, or needs of others, we can find it very difficult to effectively prioritize and follow-through.
 
Being confident means more than simply saying, ""I like myself."" Authentic confidence is grown through experiences.
 
Self-efficacy is a term that refers to our belief that we can achieve goals and complete tasks—a belief in our own abilities. Different from self-esteem, which is an overview of our feelings of self-worth, self-efficacy is more influential in helping us build confidence and resilience.
 
Walking through experiences in our day and actually observing ourselves completing tasks and feeling a sense of accomplishment helps to reinforce our sense of self-efficacy. Having a morning routine helps to set the stage for better prioritizing, more effective time-management, and greater productivity. All of this, in turn, is likely to have a positive impact on our self-efficacy.
 
Stress can cause us a lot of trouble, emotionally, physically, in our careers and in our relationships. Not feeling as if we can accomplish tasks, or feeling as if we are always behind, causes great stress. Our self-efficacy feels low, we can begin to experience negative self-talk and end up feeling distressed and overwhelmed.
 
A solid, consistent morning routine can offer us a time to practice intentional mindfulness and/or prayer, leading to feelings of greater peace as we go through our day. Feeling productive in our day can lead to a more peaceful evening and, in turn, a better night's sleep and a refreshed morning the next day.
 
Don't hit snooze! It can be so hard, especially in the beginning, to not go back to old ways and hit that snooze button so you can lay in bed just a little longer. A good morning routine allows you enough time to actually enjoy—and benefit from—your routine!
 
The amount of time can vary from person to person but could range anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. There is sometimes the assumption that you have to wake up at 4 a.m. in order to have a good morning routine. Productivity professionals suggest that you listen to yourself and know what would be realistic for you to do and keep up with. Don't worry about what others are doing.
 
Your previous morning routine might have been to wake up and immediately grab your phone, laying in bed for 45 minutes, scrolling through Instagram, or even checking emails for work. Productivity coach Jim Collins suggests that in developing our morning routine we should consider some things we could ""stop doing"" rather than focusing all of our attention on what to add to our day.
 
If we allow ourselves time away from the screen, we can use those moments for standing up, stretching, yoga, or even going for a brief walk. Any body movement in the morning will be better than lying in bed on social media! We are actively waking up our muscles as well as our minds.
 
As much as body movement is important in the morning, so is practicing stillness. Michael Hyatt, former CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers and best-selling author, entrepreneur, and professional coach suggests that stillness can be key in helping us begin the day on the right foot.
 
Activities like meditation, breathing, and prayer are all great examples of what this might look like as part of your morning routine. Practicing stillness can help us feel grounded, focused, and ready to effectively prioritize tasks. Skipping this step can lead us to continue feeling rushed and less effective in our day, which defeats the point of developing a good morning routine!
 
Practicing stillness also allows us to reset and be fully present in the moment. We aren't fully present when we are looking at emails, scrolling through Instagram, and multitasking—and this can cause increased stress and anxiety. Practicing stillness, or even doing meditation and breathing exercises, helps set the tone of the day to help you feel calm, relaxed, and in control. 
 
Since we were kids, we've likely heard the message that a good day starts with a good breakfast. It is true that the way we fuel our body in the morning can have a powerful influence on our physical health, our energy levels, and our mental attitude through the day.
 
If we feed ourselves food with little to no nutritional value, we don't feel our best, can find our energy levels peaking and crashing through the day, and feel unregulated. A healthy breakfast allows us to fuel our bodies properly and can lead to more consistent energy levels, as well as feeling more alert and focused.
 
As you wrap up your morning routine, it can be helpful to then take an intentional look at your day. Reviewing your day with intent allows you to maintain control over your schedule rather than your schedule controlling you. Be honest with yourself as to the importance of certain tasks and remember that not everything can be a top priority. As much as it may feel that way emotionally, the reality is we can't function that way without getting overwhelmed.
 
As productivity coach and entrepreneur Tor Refsland suggests, it can be helpful to focus on one thing at a time. Be intentional in deciding where your energy and efforts need to go, complete that, and then move on to the next. Trying to juggle multiple tasks can lead to ineffective time management, low productivity, and burnout.
 
Let go of any expectations to develop the perfect routine and perform it perfectly every morning. You are not looking for perfection at all in this new habit, just intentional energy being put toward creating a morning routine that works best for you. Being flexible means that you can allow yourself to adapt and adjust, finding what works well and being willing to let go of what doesn't work well. Remember that you are developing a morning routine to live more productively and peacefully, not so you can live with even more stress!
 
The most helpful habits are the ones that we can keep up with consistently. If the idea of a morning routine is new to you, don't worry. Practicing consistency will help your routine feel more and more natural over time.
 
As you feel and see the positive impact of a good morning routine has on your day, you will find it motivating to continue practicing that habit. It will feel less like something you ""should"" do and become something you look forward to doing. If you skip a day, jump right back to it the next.
 
Again, this is not about performing perfectly but about your giving yourself the opportunity to live your best.
 
Despite some of our best efforts to not let technology take over, we often find it getting in the way or being unavoidable. In developing your morning routine, don't focus on giving up technology because—let's be honest—that will not work. You may likely use your phone as your alarm!
 
What you're are looking to do instead is take back authority over your technology. As time management coach Craig Jarrow suggests, allow the technology to work for you and use it accordingly. You decide how your devices, or technology in general, will play a role in your morning routine.
 
If you find yourself letting aimless screen time invade the morning routine, allow yourself to put those boundaries back in place so that you can refocus on the purpose of developing a healthy morning routine.
 
Although we are talking about developing a good morning routine, it can be helpful to start this process the night before. If there are things you can set in place to make your morning easier, go ahead and do that before bed. Simple ideas could include laying out your clothes for the next day, prepping the food you will have for breakfast, or packing your lunch ahead of time. Your morning self will thank you!
 You don't have to naturally be a morning person in order to develop a great morning routine. How you design your morning routine is up to you and based on what you feel motivated to try and what you feel you could be consistent with over the long term. A morning routine won't be effective if it only lasts a few days. Set a reasonable time to wake up. Don't hit the snooze button. Give your routine between 30 to 90 minutes. Don't stay in bed when the alarm goes off. Any movement is helpful, it doesn't have to be intense. Stretching, yoga, and walking are good examples. Stillness is just as important as movement in the morning. Practicing stillness helps us learn how to focus our energy. Meditation, prayer, breathing exercises are good examples. Don't allow yourself to make impulsive decisions about food. Take time to plan and prep a healthy breakfast. Healthy foods to incorporate include protein, fruit, and whole grains. Be honest with yourself as you look at your day. Remember that not everything can be a top priority.

If you’re as busy and stressed as most of us, you may not take time out for self-care very often. However, personal pampering has many stress relieving benefits and should be incorporated as part of a low-stress lifestyle. This may seem like a luxury that only those with a little too much time on their hands engage in, but it's actually the stressed and busy among us who can benefit the most from the stress-relieving qualities of the spa experience. Relaxing your body can lead to a relaxed mind, and both can help to reduce stress levels, which can bring a host of benefits.
 
If you don’t have the budget for a high-end spa, you can create a relaxing home spa experience for yourself. The following are some basic elements to include in creating a home spa experience that will melt away stress and leave you feeling pampered and relaxed.
 
Privacy! Perhaps the most important part of the home spa experience is being sure you have some uninterrupted time for just you.
 
If you have to hop out of the tub to circumvent a catastrophe with your toddler or answer a string of calls, you may end up feeling even tenser! Make arrangements for some uninterrupted solitude, let the phone go to voice mail, and prepare to indulge.
 
Music. If you can arrange to have music in your bathroom, you’ll be glad you did. The right soothing melodies can help melt away the stress and make you feel more removed from reality.
 
If you live with others, the music can drown out household sounds that may remind you of everything else going on. This would take your attention away from the here and now of your home spa experience.
 
Lighting. You’d be surprised at how the right light can create a stress-relieving mood. Lighting the room with candles can fill the area with a soothing scent and create a very relaxing atmosphere.
 
Bath Products. You can go a long way in creating a luxurious bath with a few helpful products.
 
Beauty Treatments. While you’re relaxing, you may as well get more beautiful! Putting a conditioning treatment in your hair and a purifying masque on your face can make your face and scalp feel good and leave you looking more beautiful afterward.
 
Rubbing your dry skin with a loofah and scrubbing calloused feet with a pumice stone can be a little more work. You’ll love the results and it will only take a few minutes.
 
After Tub Care. You may want to follow up after you get out of the tub by applying a rich conditioning cream to your skin and a coat of nail polish to your toes.
 
Again, this will keep you feeling more pampered between spa treatments. You can look at your toes and be transported back to that soothing experience!
 
Massage. You may think a home spa treatment can’t include a massage, but it can! If you can’t enlist the soothing hands of a partner, you can use a self-massager to do the same job.
 A massage can loosen up tight muscles, promote circulation and make you feel great. 
If you’re really in the mood to indulge, you can even hire a professional massage therapist to come to your house!
 Lavender-scented bubble bath, for example, uses the power of aromatherapy to soothe you. Body scrubs are used in spas to exfoliate the skin, and can be used at home as well. Skin-moisturizing oils can be added to your bath to nourish your skin and make the pampered feeling last. Block off a specific amount of time for yourself. Sometimes busy people have a hard time just doing nothing because we can think of so many other things that need doing. If this break is scheduled to be a specific length, you may feel more entitled to simply enjoy it. Try to do this on a regular schedule, like once a week or twice a month. With repetition, you may see your spa time making a significant impact on your overall stress level! Don’t feel guilty for taking some time for yourself—you deserve it!",busy stress may take time self care often however personal pamper many stress relieve benefit incorporate part low stress lifestyle may seem like luxury little much time hand engage actually stress busy among benefit stress relieve qualities spa experience relax body lead relax mind help reduce stress level bring host benefit budget high end spa create relax home spa experience follow basic elements include create home spa experience melt away stress leave feel pamper relax privacy perhaps important part home spa experience sure uninterrupted time hop tub circumvent catastrophe toddler answer string call may end feel even tenser make arrangements uninterrupted solitude let phone voice mail prepare indulge music arrange music bathroom glad right soothe melodies help melt away stress make feel remove reality live others music drown household sound may remind everything else would take attention away home spa experience light surprise right light create stress relieve mood light room candle fill area soothe scent create relax atmosphere bath products long way create luxurious bath helpful products beauty treatments relax may well get beautiful put condition treatment hair purify masque face make face scalp feel good leave look beautiful afterward rub dry skin loofah scrub callous feet pumice stone little work love result take minutes tub care may want follow get tub apply rich condition cream skin coat nail polish toe keep feel pamper spa treatments look toe transport back soothe experience massage may think home spa treatment include massage enlist soothe hand partner use self massager job massage loosen tight muscle promote circulation make feel great really mood indulge even hire professional massage therapist come house lavender scent bubble bath example use power aromatherapy soothe body scrub use spas exfoliate skin use home well skin moisturize oil add bath nourish skin make pamper feel last block specific amount time sometimes busy people hard time nothing think many things need break schedule specific length may feel entitle simply enjoy try regular schedule like week twice month repetition may see spa time make significant impact overall stress level feel guilty take time deserve

Relationships—both romantic and platonic—at their best, can be one of the strongest sources of happiness and stress relief, offering positive experiences, keeping our moods high and steady, and creating a source of support when times are tough. At their worst, however, relationships can feel toxic and can be a significant source of stress, either the constant, low-grade type, the intermittent stress that creates some measure of anxiety even when things are going well, or a variety of other forms of stress.
 
Much of what can make a relationship stressful or stress relieving is the type of communication that holds the relationship together. Healthy communication can enable us to weather nearly any storm and can keep things running smoothly on a day-to-day basis. If communication is open and clear, small problems are dealt with quickly and easily, and the relationship moves on. When communication is less healthy, small problems can become larger problems and resentment can grow. Here are some unhealthy types of communication to avoid, and how they create stress. You’ll also find healthier ways to communicate in all of your relationships.
 
Not Really Listening: There are several forms of poor listening, and they all wear away at relationships in one way or another. There’s the lazy listening of someone who isn’t really paying attention but is politely saying, “Uh-huh…uh-huh.” This is only mildly detrimental, but it can damage a relationship when it's one-sided or chronic, and when one partner realizes that much of what they say isn’t really being heard or remembered. This can make a person feel less valued than they’d like. More damaging is the type of poor listening where an important discussion is taking place and one person is merely waiting for their turn to talk rather than really hearing what their partner is saying.
 
This creates a situation where listening isn’t really happening, so understanding cannot take place. This wastes both people’s time and brings them no closer to one another when personal details are being shared, and no closer to a resolution when done in an important discussion. Perhaps the most damaging form of poor listening is when one person simply refuses to listen or even try to understand the other side. This happens all too often and creates a standoff situation more often than not.
 
How It Creates Stress: This can range from leaving one partner feeling that their time is wasted to feeling devalued, to feeling hopeless in the relationship when it comes to feeling heard or understood.
 
What to Try Instead: Try to be present, first and foremost, when you communicate. Use active listening strategies like repeating back what you understand of what the other person has said. Try to validate feelings, and try to be sure you’re truly listening as much as you’d like to be heard. It’s more than worth the effort.
 
This form of communication can show itself in many ways as well. One partner can undermine the other by agreeing to do something and then “forgetting,” or seeming to agree, but saying the opposite the next time the subject comes up. Passive-aggressiveness can also show itself by constant disagreement over small issues, particularly in front of others.
 
How It Creates Stress: This can be stressful in part because passive-aggressiveness is hard to address; it can be easily denied, creating a “gaslighting” situation. It can also create low-grade stress to feel you’re communicating with someone who doesn’t understand or won’t remember what is said or simply doesn’t care.
 
What to Try Instead: Again, active listening can help here. Also helpful is direct communication, where you directly discuss if you have a disagreement or an issue with someone. Using ""I messages"" can help others understand how you feel as well. This may seem like the conflict at the moment, but it actually circumvents long-term conflict by resolving issues as they arise.
 
Aggressive communication involves overtly hostile communication, including criticism or even name-calling. It devalues the other person overtly, leaving people feeling defensive and leaving no veil over the overt conflict.
 
How It Creates Stress: It never feels good to be attacked. Those using aggressive communication tactics are more interested in power and “winning” rather than coming to an understanding. This brings the conflict to a new level and makes mutual understanding elusive. 
 
What to Try Instead: If you find yourself being aggressive, it’s time to stop and try to understand who you’re talking to, seeing their side as well. If you find yourself on the receiving end of aggressiveness and can’t get the person to understand your perspective, it may be time to distance yourself and use assertive communication techniques when necessary. Setting boundaries is a must.

It's a common experience, but not one that everyone talks about: you had a wonderfully romantic relationship before getting married and you have a wonderfully romantic relationship after getting married. Then you add kids to the mix and everything's a little more stressful, less romantic, and less satisfying in your marriage.
 
This experience is so common that it's practically universal, yet it's not commonly discussed when people talk about having children. In fact, many couples expect that adding children to the mix will bring them closer together, and that may happen in some ways, but often not in the ways that a couple may expect. Here's what the research has found.
 
The hard truth is that a large proportion of people find that children create a significant amount of stress in their relationship, particularly when the kids are young.
 
According to researcher Matthew Johnson of Binghamton University in his book, Great Myths of Intimate Relationships: Dating, Sex, and Marriage, research shows that this is commonplace. There is also a decrease in relationship satisfaction following the birth of the first child.﻿﻿
 
This dip in happiness doesn't go away until after children leave the nest, and by that time, many couples have divorced or drifted apart. Here are some more specifics:
 
There are many factors that go into this dip in satisfaction, and they are not the same for everyone. However, certain stressors hit many parents are particularly taxing on a relationship and an individual. The following stressors are particularly challenging.
 
Less time together: Because of the intensive caretaking required and the fact that any alone time that occurs during the baby's waking hours requires the use of a sitter, couples naturally find themselves with less time to spend together. They usually have less energy to devote to one another when they do find the time as well.﻿﻿
 When couples have a child, they are often surprised by the amount of work it takes to raise a baby, and the toddler years are labor-intensive as well. 
This can obviously take a toll on the connection they feel as they're less free to spontaneously have fun, or enjoy leisurely days together, even on the weekends.
 
Less time for oneself: When parents have too little sleep and too little time to take care of their own needs (as often happens with a new baby or a high-needs toddler), they can become more stressed and difficult to be around.﻿﻿ When one or both partners are not functioning at their best, particularly if this lasts for q prolonged amount of time, it can take a toll on the relationship.
 
Greater demands placed on the partnership: When a child enters the relationship, couples need to divide up responsibilities in caretaking,﻿﻿ even if both agree that the bulk of the work should fall on the shoulders of one parent while the other focuses more on earning money.
 
This can lead to a feeling that the couple is more of a functional partnership than a romantic partnership as couples begin to feel a little more like roommates than soulmates. Because of these additional demands and the negotiation that's needed, there's a greater chance of conflict.
 
Different responsibilities and different expectations: Additionally, when partners have different responsibilities, it's possible for one or the other to feel resentful if they feel they're working harder; without a frame of reference for what the other partner is dealing with, it's easier for new parents to feel that they should be handling things differently and feel frustrated as a result.﻿﻿
 Not everyone experiences the following challenges, but they can put a particular strain on a family. These are special circumstances that create significant additional stress: 
The good news is that, although some studies show that marital satisfaction doesn't rise significantly until children leave the nest,﻿﻿ having children is worth the effort in other ways.
 
Children enhance our altruism: Other research shows that giving to others and expressing altruism is beneficial for our overall wellbeing,﻿﻿ and having children certainly provides opportunities to give of ourselves.
 
Children reduce the likelihood of divorce: While new parents may feel less happy, they are also less likely to divorce following children.﻿﻿ This may be because they are more motivated to keep their partnership together for the sake of their children, but the increased commitment can help them weather the challenges they face and maintain their connection until happier times return.
 
Parents themselves say it's worth it: While these challenges can be difficult for a couple to face, virtually all parents say the sacrifices they make are worth it and they couldn't (or wouldn't want to) imagine their lives without their kids. They say their children bring their life meaning. This can bring significant benefits as research shows that those who have meaning in their lives tend to be happier.﻿﻿
 
If you're feeling stressed or that there is some strain on your relationship, you're not alone and you're not necessarily doing something wrong. There are many things you can and should do to safeguard your own happiness and your connection to your partner.
 
Managing the stress you face as parents can help you to preserve the happiness you've had, and to build more positive feelings and experiences from here on. You don't need to wait until your children leave home in order to raise your feelings of marital happiness; the following suggestions can help significantly.
 
Your partner isn't the only one who can help you to increase your relationship bliss. Family members, friends, and even people you hire can help you to stress less and enjoy your time together more. Here are some ideas to keep things happier.
 
It is important for you to take care of yourself and your own needs, and not just those of your children. What may feel like ""extreme"" self-care to you might be considered a normal amount of self-care to someone without children. Whatever you call it, it's important to keep your body in good shape so you have the physical and emotional stamina to do what needs to be done.
 
There is a lot of talk about ""balance,"" but that is because it is so important for stress management. That means maintaining a balance in all areas: balancing work with play, balancing meeting your needs with your kids' needs and your partner's needs, balancing time spent away from home and time spent with family, and other balances. Here are some important forms of balance to focus on.
 
The way you look at things can greatly affect your relationship and your overall happiness. In this case, there are many ways that you can focus on maintaining the right frame of mind. Any of the following can raise your level of relationship satisfaction.
 It is also important to get help if you need it. This help may take the form of a marriage counselor, an individual therapist, or even just a babysitter who can help take some of the pressure off and allow you to be your old selves again. 
Be sure to enjoy all of the things you were looking forward to when you were looking forward to children, and remind yourself that there may be sacrifices, but it's worth the effort. Savoring your good times with your partner and children is the best way to be sure the challenges and stresses don't weigh down your relationship. In the end, your relationship and your life are what you make of them.
 Children add stress to a marriage and that marital satisfaction decreases sharply when kids become part of the relationship.﻿﻿ Interestingly, this also happens to unmarried couples, so marriage itself is not the culprit in relationships that go stale. Children create stress for parents as individuals, as well as the couple as a unit. Perhaps not surprisingly, mothers take on the lion's share of childcare in most relationships. Also not surprisingly, this stress hits mothers in particular pretty hard.﻿﻿ Most women's other relationships deteriorate to a degree as their bond with their children grows stronger. The stress of children is universal.﻿﻿ It's not isolated to certain social classes or even to specific countries or regions of the world.

Sibling rivalry isn't always outgrown in childhood, however; in some cases, it only intensifies as time passes. While people often think of sibling rivalry as a childhood phenomenon, adult sibling rivalry is a common phenomenon in which adult siblings struggle to get along, argue, or are even estranged from one another.
 
If you feel strained in your relationship with your family because your parents favor another sibling or another sibling’s family, you may be surprised to find that you’re not alone. While most parents love their adult children, it’s surprisingly common for a parent to be closer to, or more supportive of, particular adult offspring over others, sparking sibling rivalry.
 One study found that more than a third of adults between 18 and 65 had apathetic or hostile relationships with their siblings. 
Research has shown that parenting plays a significant role in contributing to adult sibling rivalry. While parents may strive to remain unbiased when it comes to their kids, favoritism is actually very common.
 
Research has found:
 
So if you feel that you're less favored by your parents and that pain is affecting you in adulthood, you're not alone.
 
Sibling relationships are complex and influenced by a variety of factors including genetics, life events, gender, parental relationships, and experiences outside of the family.
 
Parental favoritism is often cited as a source of adult sibling rivalry. It’s also common for people to feel that a sibling is or ‘has always been’ favored by a parent, even if this may not be recognized or acknowledged by the rest of the family. While it hurts to be the less favored ‘child’, it’s human nature for some people to be drawn together for various reasons, such as:
 Research shows that parents are more ambivalent toward children who are not married, less educated, and share fewer of their values.  
While this can be human nature, it stings more when coming from a parent, as we think of our parents as people who are supposed to love and support us unconditionally, and we may still see them as a little greater than human (a viewpoint leftover from childhood).
 
Whatever the reason, if you find that one or more parents are favoring another sibling over you, either by having a closer relationship with your sister’s kids, bragging more about your brother’s accomplishments, paying more attention to your sister, or always taking your brother’s side in a disagreement, it can make for a stressful family gathering with raw feelings that can be easily hurt.
 
You can read about some ways to cope with sibling rivalry as an adult.
 
Understand that your parent may not ‘love’ the other sibling more, they just feel closer or more invested in their lives, for whatever reason. They may not even be aware of it, and most likely not doing it to hurt your feelings.
 
If they are actively trying to hurt you as 'punishment' for not being more the person they'd like you to be, perhaps it's best that you're not closer.
 
Find supportive people in your life to provide the love, acceptance, and approval you may not get from your parents as much as you’d like. While we may not be born into families of people who think like us and share our values, there are many people in the world that can provide the support that our family members may be unable to give. 
 Find a support system that offers unconditional love and invest your energy there. 
Don’t compete with your siblings, and don’t blame them for being favored. Even if they’re going out of their way to remain the favorite, you can’t blame them for wanting their parent’s love and approval. Just accept that your relationship with your parents is yours and try to keep it separate from sibling relationships.
 
You’ll also feel better if you accept that you may not get as much support and approval from parents as you want, and that’s okay. If you don’t come at them from a place of need, you will actually have more personal power.
 
It may be difficult to get into this frame of thought, but you’ll feel better after you do. Start by noticing all that you do get from them, and valuing that. Also, you can notice everything that you get from other areas of your life, and realize that your family of origin is only one part of your life, and it doesn't have to be the most important part.
 
Finally, if you have a committed relationship or family of your own, you can focus on providing that which you’d like to be getting from your family of origin. Focus on what you share with them, and on what you can provide to yourself in your own life, and you’ll be better able to accept familial quirks.
 
Given that there can be lasting negative effects of parental favoritism and sibling rivalry that last into adulthood if you feel significant stress from this situation and you feel you need extra support in managing this stress, don't be afraid to reach out to a professional. 
 
There are many qualified therapists who deal with family-of-origin issues like these, and they can help quite a bit with the stress. You can also adopt general stress management habits to lessen the overall stress load and make it easier to cope.
 Talk to your doctor if you feel like you need help coping with relationship stress or consult a mental health professional in your area. Favoritism affects mental health. Other research shows that parental favoritism negatively affects the mental health of all of the children in the family, either by creating resentment in the less-favored children, stress from high parental expectations for the favored child, strained sibling relationships, and other negative consequences. Parents often feel closer to one child. A study from Cornell University included interviews from 275 mothers in their 60s and 70s and their 671 offspring. 70% of the mothers could specify a child to whom they felt closest. Interestingly, only 15% of interviewed offspring felt that there was equal treatment by their mothers. The impact of this favoritism can be lasting. Another study found that perceived maternal favoritism could have a long-lasting effect on sibling relationships. Recollections of this perceived favoritism in childhood actually had a greater impact than current favoritism on sibling relationships. Geographical proximity: Your sister who lives closer to mom may understandably spend more time with her. Shared personality features: Your dad and brother think the same way, and thus understand each other more easily. Other factors within or beyond your control: Perhaps your world view doesn't match your parents' as closely as that of one of your siblings, and they resent it, consciously or unconsciously.",sibling rivalry always outgrow childhood however case intensify time pass people often think sibling rivalry childhood phenomenon adult sibling rivalry common phenomenon adult siblings struggle get along argue even estrange one another feel strain relationship family parent favor another sibling another sibling family may surprise find alone parent love adult children surprisingly common parent closer supportive particular adult offspring others spark sibling rivalry one study find third adults apathetic hostile relationships siblings research show parent play significant role contribute adult sibling rivalry parent may strive remain unbiased come kid favoritism actually common research find feel less favor parent pain affect adulthood alone sibling relationships complex influence variety factor include genetics life events gender parental relationships experience outside family parental favoritism often cite source adult sibling rivalry also common people feel sibling always favor parent even may recognize acknowledge rest family hurt less favor child human nature people draw together various reason research show parent ambivalent toward children marry less educate share fewer value human nature sting come parent think parent people suppose love support unconditionally may still see little greater human viewpoint leftover childhood whatever reason find one parent favor another sibling either closer relationship sister kid brag brother accomplishments pay attention sister always take brother side disagreement make stressful family gather raw feel easily hurt read ways cope sibling rivalry adult understand parent may love sibling feel closer invest live whatever reason may even aware likely hurt feel actively try hurt punishment person like perhaps best closer find supportive people life provide love acceptance approval may get parent much like may bear families people think like share value many people world provide support family members may unable give find support system offer unconditional love invest energy compete siblings blame favor even way remain favorite blame want parent love approval accept relationship parent try keep separate sibling relationships also feel better accept may get much support approval parent want okay come place need actually personal power may difficult get frame think feel better start notice get value also notice everything get areas life realize family origin one part life important part finally commit relationship family focus provide like get family origin focus share provide life better able accept familial quirk give last negative effect parental favoritism sibling rivalry last adulthood feel significant stress situation feel need extra support manage stress afraid reach professional many qualify therapists deal family origin issue like help quite bite stress also adopt general stress management habit lessen overall stress load make easier cope talk doctor feel like need help cop relationship stress consult mental health professional area favoritism affect mental health research show parental favoritism negatively affect mental health children family either create resentment less favor children stress high parental expectations favor child strain sibling relationships negative consequences parent often feel closer one child study cornell university include interview mother offspring mother could specify child felt closest interestingly interview offspring felt equal treatment mother impact favoritism last another study find perceive maternal favoritism could long last effect sibling relationships recollections perceive favoritism childhood actually greater impact current favoritism sibling relationships geographical proximity sister live closer mom may understandably spend time share personality feature dad brother think way thus understand easily factor within beyond control perhaps world view match parent closely one siblings resent consciously unconsciously

Research shows that healthy and supportive relationships can reduce stress and improve your overall health and sense of well-being. However, all relationships are not equally supportive. Building a network of supportive friends, or even just one supportive relationship can be vital to your wellbeing. Here are some key skills that can help you to build relationships with people that are truly supportive and sustaining.
 
The more people you have in your life, the more likely you are to have truly supportive relationships with at least one of them. It’s beneficial to be able to regularly add new people to your circle. Here are some good ways to meet people.
 
It’s important to make time to nurture relationships and to go out and have fun with friends. You may feel like you just don’t have time to spend on this, but time management and organization techniques can help you find more time in your life to spend on friendships.
 Effective time management techniques can also help you to show up on time, remember birthdays and other important events, help friends when they’re in need, and do other things that will strengthen friendships and make them supportive. 
People often think of assertiveness as ""standing up for yourself"" and ""not letting people push you around""—basically the alternative to passivity. While this is mostly true, assertiveness is also the alternative to aggressiveness, a way of handling people where you get your needs met at the expense of others’ needs. Developing the skill of assertiveness can really help you strengthen your relationships, making them mutually supportive, lasting and opening the lines of communication.
 
When we’ve had a hard day, sometimes being able to talk to a friend about our feelings is all it takes to turn things around and make stress a feeling of connection and well-being. Being truly listened to and understood can have profound effects on us. When dealing with friends, it’s important to give as well as receive this supportive type of listening when support is truly needed. Here are some things to remember when friends are talking about things that stress or upset them:
 
You can learn more about how to be a good listener, an important skill to have.
 
Some people give off positive energy that makes us feel good, and others give off negative energy that drains us. If you pay attention to the signals that your intuition sends you and act on those signals, you’ll have a healthier social circle. Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 
The answers to these questions will help you begin to develop your intuition, which will help you strengthen your relationships, or help you with...
 
Not everyone is an appropriate match. If there’s someone in your life who makes you feel bad about yourself, doesn’t share any of your interests or values, or is someone that you just don’t mesh well with, it’s perfectly acceptable to put that relationship on the back burner, let it fade altogether, or not develop it in the first place. Even if you were at one time close, people change and grow in different directions. That doesn’t mean there’s something ‘wrong’ with either of you.
 
But if someone in your life is no longer good for you, it’s perfectly acceptable to let them go. (Conversely, if you’d like to keep them in your life out of loyalty, albeit in a periphery role, that’s OK, too. However, it would be beneficial to remember not to count on them for support, if they’re not able to give it to you.) Only you know if the relationship is worth keeping or not. But it is important to have several people you can count on for support in your life.
 
It takes some work, but cultivating a circle of truly supportive friendships can make a huge difference in how you handle stress and life.
 Ask them about their feelings, and listen. Reflect back what you hear, so they know you really understand. Instead of always trying to tie the conversation back to your experiences, focus questions on them and their feelings. When they’re talking, are you missing some of what they say because you’re waiting for them to stop talking so you can say what you want to say next? Stop, and really listen to them. Does the conversation flow easily, or is it forced? Do you feel they truly understand, accept and support you? Do you feel you truly understand, accept and support them? Do you feel better or worse about yourself when you’re with them? Do you leave them feeling energized or mildly depressed? Do you include them in your life for positive qualities they have, or just to have more people in your life?",research show healthy supportive relationships reduce stress improve overall health sense well however relationships equally supportive build network supportive friends even one supportive relationship vital wellbeing key skills help build relationships people truly supportive sustain people life likely truly supportive relationships least one beneficial able regularly add new people circle good ways meet people important make time nurture relationships fun friends may feel like time spend time management organization techniques help find time life spend friendships effective time management techniques also help show time remember birthdays important events help friends need things strengthen friendships make supportive people often think assertiveness stand let people push around basically alternative passivity mostly true assertiveness also alternative aggressiveness way handle people get need meet expense others need develop skill assertiveness really help strengthen relationships make mutually supportive last open line communication hard day sometimes able talk friend feel take turn things around make stress feel connection well truly listen understand profound effect deal friends important give well receive supportive type listen support truly need things remember friends talk things stress upset learn good listener important skill people give positive energy make feel good others give negative energy drain pay attention signal intuition send act signal healthier social circle question ask answer question help begin develop intuition help strengthen relationships help everyone appropriate match someone life make feel bad share interest value someone mesh well perfectly acceptable put relationship back burner let fade altogether develop first place even one time close people change grow different directions mean something wrong either someone life longer good perfectly acceptable let conversely like keep life loyalty albeit periphery role however would beneficial remember count support able give know relationship worth keep important several people count support life take work cultivate circle truly supportive friendships make huge difference handle stress life ask feel listen reflect back hear know really understand instead always try tie conversation back experience focus question feel talk miss say wait stop talk say want say next stop really listen conversation flow easily force feel truly understand accept support feel truly understand accept support feel better worse leave feel energize mildly depress include life positive qualities people life

We may not all have block parties and an active neighborhood watch, but you may be more affected your neighbors than you think; the neighborhood we live in can affect our happiness and stress levels in multiple ways. When you're thinking of strategies to manage stress, consider investing in your relationships with your neighbors. 
 
The following are ways that neighbors can affect our lives and be resources for stress management.
 
With our busy schedules, we don't always see friends as often as we'd like. For a bit of socializing that takes only minutes out of your day, it's nice to stop and chat with people for a few minutes on your way out to your car.
 
And the more people you have available for shared social support, the better, generally speaking.
 
Some friendly neighborhoods who share dinners, minimizing the effort it takes to cook. Others trade fruit from their trees. A neighbor who borrows a few eggs may come back with a plate of cookies that the eggs helped create.
 
Knowing your neighbors increases everyone's ability to share.
 
Knowing the people around you can bring a sense of security. If you need something—whether it's a cup of sugar when you're baking cookies or someone to call the police if they see someone lurking outside your home—it's nice to know you can depend on those around you and they can depend on you.
 
Knowing the people who live around you provides a strengthened sense of pride in your home and neighborhood. Coming home just feels nicer when your neighbors are your friends.
 
While you may not be able to change the neighborhood in which you live, you can change the experience you have in your own neighborhood by getting more involved with those around you and taking pride in the area in which you live. The following are some ideas and resources that can help you to feel more at home in your neighborhood:
 
If you live in a generally safe area, take a morning or evening walk. It's a great stress reliever that also allows you to get to know many of your neighbors, get an understanding of who lives where, and feel more at home in your surroundings.
 
It's simple enough, but if you're not in the habit of smiling and giving a friendly hello to the people you encounter in your neighborhood, it's a good habit to start.
 
While not everyone will return the friendliness immediately, it's a quick way to get to know people and build relationships, even if you've lived close for years and haven't really said much to one another.
 
The more veteran members of the neighborhood often have the inside scoop on the neighborhood. You may be surprised at how much you can learn if you stop to take the time to talk to the sweet old lady at the end of the block.
 
This may seem obvious, but if you have a fruit-bearing tree, it's a great idea to offer some of our overflows to your neighbors. It's always nice to have fresh fruit, so even if not all of your neighbors have an interest in what you have to offer (maybe they have their own lemon trees and don't need yours), they will likely appreciate the offer. And if you're lucky, they may have some fruits or veggies to share as well.
 
If you already know several of your neighbors in a superficially friendly way, you may want to get to know them better and meet the rest by throwing a block party. They're surprisingly fun and easy.
 
To feel safer at night and build a sense of community at the same time, starting a neighborhood watch program is a great idea.
 
Getting more information on stress and resources to help you to manage it can help you to build habits that can help you to cope with stress once your stress response is triggered.

We've all dealt with aggressiveness as a communication style in our relationships at one time or another, whether it's come from a parent, a friend, a co-worker, or a romantic partner. In fact, if this style of communication was common in your family as you were growing up, it may be a style of communication that you use without realizing it. This style of communication is favored by narcissists and bullies, but it can show up in conversations anywhere, from the office to the bedroom.
 
When aggressive communication is used by one person, emotional force is often experienced so that the rights of others are not even allowed to surface. When this happens, others feel victimized and relationships suffer. In that way, relationship aggression is bad for the aggressors as well as the recipients of the aggression.
 Aggressiveness is a mode of communication and behavior where one expresses their feelings, needs, and rights without regard or respect for the needs, rights, and feelings of others. 
The toll that relationship conflict takes in terms of stress can affect us in many ways. It can impact our stress levels, and it can also affect our health and happiness. (See this article on the toll of conflict to know more about the negative impact aggression can take.)
 
Because of the lack of real connection in their relationships, aggressive individuals tend to cause others stress and experience increased levels of stress themselves, as their relationships tend to be conflicted and their personal goals not as often achieved. A powerful tool to use in the face of aggressive communication is assertiveness. Assertiveness is often used as a synonym for forceful communication but, in contrast to aggressiveness, assertiveness involves expressing one's own needs and rights while respecting the needs and rights of others and maintaining the dignity of both parties. This results in healthier relationships and increased life satisfaction. And while communication styles aren't the only way that aggressiveness can surface in relationships, those who endeavor to change their aggressive communication patterns to assertive ones tend to be open to other improvements as well.
 
Learning about communication techniques can be helpful in a couple of ways. Assertive communication techniques can enable us to draw healthy boundaries with others so we have a line of defense against any aggressiveness they display. These healthy communication techniques can also help us to avoid being accidentally aggressive with others, which can also help to avoid conflict. Both of these positive effects make it well worth the effort to learn about assertive communication techniques.
 
Being assertive means voicing your needs while listening to and respecting others' needs. It means looking for win-win solutions rather than win-lose ones. It means expressing your feelings in a calm way, explaining why you feel this way, and asking for what you would like rather than expecting others to guess. It also means listening well and trying to not only understanding others' needs but communicating to them that you understand.
 
Assertiveness may feel aggressive at first to those who are used to a passive style of communication. Conversely, it can feel passive to those who are accustomed to an aggressive style of communication. If you weren't raised in a family where assertiveness and respect for others was the norm, it may require some practice to find the balance between steamrolling over other's needs and allowing them to trample yours, but it's well worth the effort. Once you find that balance, it's easy to continue being assertive in all of your interactions, which can prevent conflict and resentment in the future.
 
What do you know about your habitual communication style? Are you prone to aggressiveness, assertiveness, or passivity? Here are some questions you can ask yourself:
 
The above questions can help you get started thinking of whether you are comfortable standing up for yourself, too comfortable walking all over others, or have perhaps found a comfortable middle ground. If you're not sure, read on and see if you're guilty of any of these common conflict resolution mistakes. You can also learn more about healthy communication techniques you can use with the many people in your life--see how many of these you already put into practice.
 Do I seek out other people's opinions, or just share my own? Am I upset if others don't agree with me? Do I talk over people or interrupt frequently? Do I check-in with people to see if they're comfortable, or do I force my own agenda? Do I put people down? Do I know how to stand up for myself? Do I know how to disagree without being disagreeable?

You may have heard, or assumed, that relationships are good for your health, longevity, and life expectancy. In general, that's true—except when a relationship is bad. Anyone who's been through a tough divorce, dealt with difficult parents or children, or had a backstabbing friend knows that not all relationships are good for your health. If a person in our lives creates stress and problems, that has an impact on well-being too.
 
Researchers measured relationship quality in a study of 9,000 men and women in the British Civil Service in a study published in 2007. The participants were surveyed about their relationships and the different negative aspects that exist in their close relationships. Participants were also closely monitored for health problems.
 
Those who reported ""adverse"" close relationships had a 34% increase in the risk of developing heart problems, even after taking weight, social support, and other factors into consideration. That’s a pretty substantial increase. And more recent research, such as a University of Michigan study from 2016, supports this finding, noting that ""stress and [negative] relationship quality directly effect the cardiovascular system.""
 
In other studies, researchers have found:
 
Suppressing your feelings is unhealthy, especially when those feelings are anger or resentment. Some research suggests that couples tend to die younger when partners have different styles of coping with anger; the more severe the mismatch, the greater the risk of early death for both partners.
 
In some relationships, one person might be very dissatisfied, while the other is completely unaware of an issue. Addressing this situation means conflict, but that conflict does not have to end a relationship.
 
Effective conflict resolution can improve and repair a relationship. Unresolved conflict is bad, but a botched attempt at reaching a resolution is even worse. How you choose to resolve conflict will affect any relationship in which you're involved. If you're dealing with extreme conflict, couples counseling or individual therapy can be very helpful..
 
Interacting with friends and family is good. Staving off loneliness increases your life expectancy and protects your brain, in addition to many other benefits. But spending time and energy on less desirable friends and family members can literally make you less healthy. Do your best to maximize time spent with the friends and family you enjoy being around, and minimize interactions with those who aren't as pleasant and who bring negativity into your life.
 
Unfortunately, some negative people can't always be avoided, particularly if they are family. In that case, use relaxation techniques to let go of the stress these encounters cause. Learn how to actively manage your interactions with difficult people so they have less of an impact on your health and life.
 Social isolation is linked to inflammation and hypertension. A review of two decades of research, published in 2016, underlined the connection between being socially isolated and the risk of inflammation, comparing isolation to physical inactivity in adolescence. The same study reported that social isolation could be riskier than clinical factors, like diabetes, when it came to hypertension (high blood pressure). Prolonged conflict with other people was strongly associated with lower self-rated health and more health issues, according to a survey of more than 650 adults over two years.

Betrayal, aggression, and just plain insensitivity: people can hurt us in a million ways, and forgiveness isn’t always easy. Whether you’ve been cut off in traffic, slighted by your mother-in-law, betrayed by a spouse, or badmouthed by a co-worker, most of us are faced with a variety of situations both serious and mundane that we can choose to ruminate over or forgive. But forgiveness, like so many things in life, is easier said than done.
 
Forgiveness can be a challenge for several reasons. Sometimes forgiveness can be confused with condoning what someone has done to us: “That’s OK. Why not do it again?” Even for people who understand the distinction between accepting someone's bad behavior as ""okay"" and accepting that it happened, forgiveness can be difficult because these two are easily confused.
 
Forgiveness can also be difficult when the person who wronged us doesn’t seem to deserve our forgiveness. It can feel like you are letting them ""off the hook."" While this feeling is completely understandable, it's vital to remember that forgiveness allows us to let go of a connection we have to those who have wronged us and move forward—with or without them.
 Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that forgiveness benefits the forgiver more than the one who is forgiven. 
Ultimately, forgiveness is especially challenging because it’s hard to let go of what happened. Forgiving someone who has committed unacceptable behavior can be difficult when we are having trouble letting go of anger or hurt surrounding the event itself.
 
Forgiveness is good for your heart—literally. One 2017 study from the Annals of Behavioral Medicine was the first to associate greater forgiveness with less stress and ultimately better mental health.﻿﻿ Increases in forgiveness made for less perceived stress, which was followed by decreases in mental health symptoms (but not physical health symptoms).
 
Other research in 2017 showed that 'state' forgiveness﻿﻿ --- an intentional, purpose-driven disposition bent toward forgiveness --- produced in those participants who undertook forgiveness perceived senses of mental well-being, which included reductions in negative affect, feeling positive emotions, experiencing positive relations with others, discerning sensibilities of spiritual growth, and identifying a sense of meaning and purpose in life as well as a greater sense of empowerment. 
 
Research reported slightly earlier, in 2015, linked forgiveness with the proverbial forgetting.﻿﻿ Emotional, intentional forgiveness influenced subsequent incidental forgetting. Determined, purposeful emotional forgiveness causes forgetting and is an important first step in the forgiveness cascade.
 
To sum it up, forgiveness is good for your body, your relationships, and your place in the world. That’s reason enough to convince virtually anyone to do the work of letting go of anger and working on forgiveness.
 
Forgiveness may not always be easy, but it can be easier with a few exercises and the right mindset. First, keep in mind that forgiveness is something you do for yourself to sever your emotional attachment to what happened. (Think of taking your hand away from a hot burner on the stove—it remains hot, but you move away from it for your own safety.)
 
Also, remind yourself that you are moving forward, and forgiving this person allows them (or at least what they've done) to stay in the past as you move on. Journaling, prayer, or meditation, and loving-kindness meditation can all be helpful in easing yourself into forgiveness as well.

Though it's usually not the intended outcome of giving unsolicited advice, many who receive it often feel stressed, offended, or simply annoyed by unwanted suggestions.﻿﻿ Setting a boundary in this regard, if you feel you need one, is perfectly reasonable and something that can bring you increased emotional safety.﻿﻿ But it's best to do so in a way that takes into account the individual's underlying reasons for doing what they're doing to avoid unnecessary conflict and more stress.
 
People who repeatedly give unwanted advice can be well-meaning and genuinely want to help. It's important to take that possibility for what it is, as there truly may not be more to someone's intention than that.
 
However, it is also likely—particularly if someone engages in this behavior compulsively—that they are driven to do so by a need for emotional validation or personal power. People who grow up in chronically stressful environments in which they did not feel safe, or in emotionally invalidating environments in which expression of their emotions was punished or ignored, may have trouble self-regulating and seek to avoid uncomfortable feelings through external validation.﻿﻿
 
One way someone might do this is by cultivating a sense of self-worth around the ability to influence the actions of others. One study found that people with a high tendency to seek power were more likely to give advice than those with an opposite tendency.﻿﻿
 Under the guise of altruism, people may be driven to give you unwanted advice because it makes them feel powerful or in control, helping to abate their chronic psychological distress. They may not be fully aware of this drive, however. 
These people may also display a problematic degree of emotional vulnerability, becoming upset very quickly, expressing emotions dramatically, and/or taking a long time to calm down. It is possible that their emotions were only validated in childhood when they were at their loudest, encouraging them to adopt responses to discomfort that are hyperbolic in most situations.﻿﻿
 
When someone is giving advice in order to make themselves feel more powerful, there is underlying anxiety to their behavior that recipients of the advice tend to pick up on. It can be tempting in this situation to react harshly to the advice giver and to accuse them of being manipulative, but this approach might backfire.
 
If the act of giving advice is contributing actively to someone's feelings of self-worth, an outright rejection may be perceived as a threat, activating their fight-or-flight response, possibly causing them to double-down on their validation-seeking behavior or leading to a larger conflict.﻿﻿
 Take space from the situation so that you can respond from a nonreactive place. When you feel that you can do that, validate their advice in order to create an atmosphere of emotional security. 
The key is to validate without over-identifying. You can let them know that you've heard them and appreciate where they are coming from without taking on the potentially damaging narrative that you couldn't have gotten by without their help.﻿﻿
 
To do this while proactively communicating a boundary around further advice, you might say something like, ""Thanks for the idea. I have my own plan for handling this, but I really appreciate your perspective and will take it into consideration. Can I let you know when I need help in the future?""
 
If you have trouble setting boundaries without being reactive, prioritize working on your own ability to self-regulate. As uncomfortable as it may make you to continuously receive unwanted advice, if you can respond with compassion, the situation will likely diffuse much faster.﻿﻿
 
When the person giving you advice is simply doing it out of the goodness of their heart and truly has no other underlying motives, taking this same approach can be helpful—but it might feel mean. Remember that you can simultaneously appreciate someone's caring nature while respecting your own comfort level.

"
When families get together, we hope for fun times characterized by love and bonding, but we often find that family conflicts occur during these times as well. In fact, in most families, there are longstanding patterns of interaction and roles that people traditionally play within these interactions. When adult children get together with family, they often find themselves slipping back into these patterns, something laughingly referred to as ""revertigo.""
 
These interactions can be positive, but when they’re negative, they can bring high amounts of stress to a family gathering.
 
How often have you had an experience where you knew you were going to see your family and could predict in advance what annoying or frustrating interactions you might have with certain family members, and things went exactly as you’d hoped they wouldn’t? Have you ever wished you had a remote control for humans, complete with pause, rewind and mute buttons? While you can’t control the actions of others, you can control your response to their actions, which can alter the whole dynamic and create more positive interactions.
 
In fact, Dr. Kathleen Kelley Reardon, USC Marshall School professor and author of Comebacks at Work: Using Conversation to Master Confrontation, estimates that 75% of how people treat us is under our control because of this. She advocates taking a different approach if you want to experience new, more positive results with these types of conflicts in the future.
 
“Communication is like chess where every move one person makes influences the choices of the other,” says Reardon. “A good rule of thumb is to not say what you would normally say in response to any provocation. If you usually meet a challenge with a challenge, try asking a question instead. If you let someone go on and on and that leads to anger, link something you have to say to his or her topic and then change to another one.
 
If you think you’re being blamed for something, instead of getting your back up, try saying, “There’s some truth to that” or “I hadn’t thought of it that way but I see your point.” In other words, tweak what you normally do. Then you won’t just slip into conflict. Above all, don’t be predictable. When we’re predictable, those who want to argue can maneuver us into doing just that.”
 
This solution is based on the observation that many of our conflicts with people we know well are based on repeated patterns that we unwittingly perpetuate. We may try to be proactive about responding in a way that will resolve the conflict each time (though let's face it, many of us are more focused on “winning” the argument rather than on dissolving or resolving the conflict, and there’s often a difference). This response could actually serve to keep things going the way they have in the past, which may not be what we want.
 
“All families and most friends bring with them emotional baggage from the past,” explains Reardon. “In Comebacks at Work we describe how this leads to URPS (unwanted repetitive episodes) in conversation. Most of us slip into these dysfunctional and stressful patterns without even noticing because we’ve been in them so many times before.
 
“Some of the common URPS involve sibling rivalry issues, patterns with parents that have never gone away, political issues even in families where everyone identifies with the same political party, and who is more right about topics that aren’t really important.”
 
According to Reardon, the key to getting out of these URPS situations is to recognize “choice points” in a conversation, or points in the discourse where you can alter the tone and direction that the exchange takes, by altering your own responses. She gives the following scenario as an example:
 
Alan: That’s a stupid idea.Eleanor: What makes you a genius?Alan: I’m not a genius but I know when something is ridiculous.Eleanor: You’re ridiculous.
 
“After Alan said, “That’s a stupid idea,” Eleanor was at a choice point, explains Reardon. “She reacted in the way many people would. But, she could have altered this conversation.” Here’s how that might look:
 
Alan: “That’s a stupid idea.”Eleanor: “At first, I thought so too. But hear me out.”
 
Or Eleanor might have said: “New ideas tend to sound stupid, but you’ll see in a minute why this one isn’t.”
 
“Instead of reacting to Alan with an attack, she chose to bypass that option,” Reardon points out. “Instead, she allowed that he may have a point but he’ll think differently when she finishes speaking.
 
“This is responding rather than reacting,” she says. “It gives the other person a chance to rethink whether he or she wants to argue. It’s a gift of sorts to be accepted or not – the other person’s choice point. Most people respond to such generosity in conversation with returned generosity.”
 
If you're anticipating conflict the next time you get together with certain people, you may want to think about things ahead of time and identify patterns you've experienced before, think about potential choice points, and consider alternative responses you may choose.
 
Try to come up with a few tactics for each scenario, and think about what would feel right for you.
 Rather than getting caught up in the usual conflict and hurt feelings, try to imagine what tone you'd like the conversation to take, and see if you can lead the interaction in that direction with your own responses at pivotal choice points. 
You may be surprised at how quickly things can change.
 
Learning better conflict resolution skills, knowing what to avoid in a conflict, and how to cool off when upset can also help immensely. And when all else fails, extra-strong listening skills have helped de-escalate many a conflict.

Great insights can come from asking an expert or a trusted, caring friend for advice. Polling a group of people, even strangers, for advice can provide a variety of helpful ideas. But sometimes advice is offered when you didn’t ask for it. New moms, college students, and people who work with the public may be more prone to getting unsolicited advice, but most of us experience it at times. And it doesn't always feel helpful.
 
Unsolicited advice has the potential to create stress.﻿﻿ When someone offers their take on what you could be doing better, it can often feel like criticism.﻿﻿ Sometimes they're not judging, and it's our own defensiveness that's making the advice feel like criticism. Other times they are absolutely judging us and our feelings are spot-on.
 
The stress can be compounded if the advice-giver takes offense if their advice isn't welcomed and followed. When the advice doesn't feel right to you, this can put you in a difficult position and create frustration and even resentment on both sides.
 
People who offer unsolicited advice may have pure motives (though this isn't always the case), but it doesn't always feel helpful. Understanding their motives, however, can be helpful. People give advice for many reasons, some of which are well-intentioned, others less so.
 
It can be confusing knowing what to do with all the types of unsolicited advice that we encounter, so it helps to examine where the words might be coming from. Here are some common reasons people are compelled to give unsolicited advice.
 
Whether or not the advice fits with your values or specific situation, this type of advice generally feels good to get.
 
Often people offer advice simply because they think they can help, and they want to make your life easier. Their motives are altruistic. Perhaps there’s something they know of that they think would work perfectly with your situation or personality, and they would love to improve your life or reduce your stress.
 
Particularly if you are talking to them about a problem, even if you're just needing some validation or emotional support, people may assume you are looking them for answers. They might feel pressure to supply those answers.
 
Sometimes a stranger offers unsolicited advice as a way to start a conversation. Or a friend gives advice to forge a connection. Friends often assume they can help you by offering you a solution, even if you didn't ask for one. This type of advice is well-meaning and can often be helpful.
 
Other times, unsolicited advice comes from those who have found something that works for them, and they want to share it with the world. They see your situation as a perfect fit for this new product, tool or piece of wisdom that’s made their life so much better. They wish someone had told them about it sooner, so they share.
 
It's also common for people who have faced the same challenges as you and found what was a great solution for them to want to share. They assume their solution will affect you the same way.
 
This type of advice, though generally harmless, can feel less helpful. It is sometimes relevant to your situation, but often not.
 
People who offer unsolicited advice from this motivation may have a lot of knowledge in a certain area that pertains to your situation. They want to be needed. They share their advice with others in order to feel valued, powerful, and important.﻿﻿
 
If you’re sharing your feelings and frustrations with them, some people may want to help you by trying to solve your problem. If that’s what you were looking for, great. But if you just wanted a supportive ear or a little validation, sometimes people can’t tell the difference and offer advice instead.
 
If you routinely share your problems and feelings with people as a way of venting, but take no steps toward solving your own dilemmas, let’s face it: They might be sick of hearing this. Even if they know that you just want to talk, they could be trying to get you to do something constructive rather than continually emoting.
 
This only applies to some unsolicited advice situations. If you looking inward, you’ll know whether it applies to you.
 
Some people, particularly those with narcissistic tendencies, need to be in the role of ""teacher"" virtually all of the time, or perhaps just like to hear themselves pontificate. Their advice is often long-winded and not always appropriate to your situation. It's more about them more than you.﻿﻿ These people often can't imagine that their advice won't be the answer you're looking for, even if it doesn't fit your situation.
 
This type of advice has more to do with the advice-giver than with you. It can sometimes feel like a subtle snub or a slap in the face, and leave you with an uneasy feeling, even if you don’t know why.
 
Some advice-givers want to take the role of ""more knowledgeable person"" in the relationship dynamic. Giving advice puts them in that position.﻿﻿
 
Sometimes when people have seen something in you that they don’t like, they give unsolicited advice as a way to change it. This advice can often feel like an insult more than a genuine attempt to help.
 
Believe it or not, some people love conflict, love hearing themselves argue, and get a feeling of personal power from telling others how wrong they are.﻿﻿ Such people, consciously or unconsciously, tend to give lots of advice as a way of bringing up topics to debate.
 
Thinking about where advice is coming from and examining your own thoughts and feelings can help you see if perhaps you’re being overly sensitive to unsolicited advice. Doing this can make it easier to handle unsolicited advice.

Families can be a life-giving force when they are healthy and relatively stress-free. When healthy, they can be one constant that you can count on—so much so that a healthy family relationship can have a positive impact on your health and well-being.﻿﻿ 
 
Strong family relationships also are a source of comfort, guidance, and strength that you can draw on in times of stress. Likewise, they provide a sense of belonging and unconditional love you are not likely to find anywhere else.
 
But when these relationships are unhealthy or stress-filled, they can feel exhausting and emotionally draining. In fact, a highly-conflicted or toxic family relationship can cause a lot of damage.
 
Not only do these unhealthy relationships deprive you of support, but they also can create additional stress, conflict, and even health issues. For instance, research indicates that 10% to 30% of children grow up in families where their health and well-being are endangered or weakened by unhealthy family relationships.﻿﻿
 
Generally, people depend on their families in times of crisis for emotional and practical support. Sometimes they even depend on them for support when they're experiencing a financial crisis.
 
The family is a constant in a person's life. Families also carry your history and share your future. Who better than siblings, parents, and other close relatives to reminisce with about your childhood?
 This connection to fond memories, support in times of need, and unconditional love is the unique way that families can bring happiness, stress relief, and a sense of well-being. 
According to researchers, strong families all have six qualities in common.﻿﻿ These qualities include appreciation/affection, commitment, positive communication, time together, strong coping skills, and spiritual well-being. Here's a closer look at each.
 
Healthy families help one another when they need it. They also keep their promises, support one another, and show affection when they are together. A warm embrace, a squeeze of the hand, or a pat on the back all are gestures that speak love and support to one another.
 
Healthy families are loyal, supportive, and committed. They find it easy to trust one another with the details of their lives. They also share responsibilities and make decisions together and are there for you when you need them. No one has your back like your family.
 
Healthy families often share regular meals together and enjoy talking about their lives and their experiences. What's more, criticisms, putdowns, name-calling, and other types of emotional abuse are rare.
 Instead, families encourage and build one another up. 
Typically, healthy families have fun when they are together, smiling and laughing often. Whether their time is planned or spontaneous, strong families enjoy being around one another. They also share one another's interests and passions.
 
Resilience is a hallmark of healthy families. While dealing with a challenge or a crisis is never easy, healthy families encourage one another to remain strong and hopeful. They often look for the good in a bad situation and accept the things they cannot change. Going through a crisis together makes their bonds even stronger.
 
Healthy families usually have positive outlooks on life. They also are filled with thankfulness and gratitude. Typically, these families share common values and may even share the same spiritual or religious beliefs.
 Even if they do not agree on everything, healthy families are kind and respectful of other opinions. 
Unfortunately, because family relationships are so complex, they're not always easy to navigate. In fact, dealing with difficult family members is downright hard. And even though it may be better for your stress level and your health to eliminate strained relationships from your life, it's not always that simple when the difficult people are related to you. To keep conflict at bay and reduce your stress level, check out these tips on dealing with common family issues.
 
Conflict is virtually inevitable in any relationship, but there are healthy ways of dealing with it. For instance, if you know that you and your family member disagree over religion or politics, try to stick to more neutral topics. Likewise, if your family member has some negative traits that really rub you the wrong way, focus on the positives instead.
 Listening and being empathetic whenever you can is especially important as well. But don't be a doormat either. It's fine to be assertive and let family members know when they have crossed a line. 
And, if the conversation is spiraling out of control, know when to take a timeout. With a little hard work, you may be able to have a respectful conversation with your family members, even when you don't see eye to eye.
 
When people get together with their families of origin, it is not uncommon to revert back to old behavior patterns. But if you’ve grown beyond these old roles and they no longer reflect who you are, don't be afraid to be the person you are now. It may take some hard work to stay true to yourself, but in the end you will be glad you did.
 
When family members mention how much you have changed or tell you how much they miss the old you, don't feel obligated to be that person again, especially if you changed for a reason. For instance, if you were once a heavy drinker and the life of the party, it might be hard for family members to adjust to seeing you without a drink in your hand. But they will get used to it. You don't have to sacrifice who you are now to make other people feel comfortable. This is called people-pleasing and it's an unhealthy habit to fall into.
 
Typically, prejudices arise from a misguided or learned belief that certain groups of people need to be treated differently or with less respect and consideration. Some common prejudices involve race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
 
When you witness prejudice in family members, it's important to tactfully address it right away. Sometimes family members don't realize that what they are doing or saying is marginalizing and insulting. Talking about tolerance and acceptance is important. Just be sure to do it in a loving way.
 
If you get emotional, judgmental, or angry, your family members are likely to focus on those things instead of hearing what you're saying. And, if they are unwilling to be respectful, you may need to establish some boundaries with them. Being family doesn't give them the right to treat you, a significant other, or anyone else disrespectfully.
 
Sometimes families are filled with gossiping, backstabbing, and other types of relational drama. When this happens, it is best to shut it down or stay out of it altogether. Nothing good comes from throwing shade, talking behind people's backs, and pitting people against one another.
 
Even if you don't participate in the drama, just listening to the mean words communicates that you might condone it. Instead, try redirecting the conversation or walking away. You also can be more direct and indicate that you are not comfortable with the conversation.
 The key is to let your family member know that you don't want to be part of the drama. 
Sibling relationships are complex, but even more so if sibling rivalry or jealousy exists. In fact, adult sibling rivalry can cause strained relationships, where siblings argue and struggle to get along.
 
If you feel your relationship with your family is strained because your parents favor another sibling, you may be surprised to find that you’re not alone.
 
Try not to take perceived favoritism personally or allow it to impact your relationship with the family. While it may appear your parent is closer to your sibling, this does not mean that it is true or that your parent loves that sibling more than you. And whatever you do, do not perpetuate these feelings by competing with your sibling.
 
While you cannot control the types of relationships you have with your family members, you can create greater harmony in your relationships. Work toward strengthening and improving your family relationships. Be open, honest, and empathetic, but don't be afraid to set boundaries with toxic or abusive family members. You are not required to endure abuse just because you're related.

The concept of ""boundaries"" in relationships is one that is commonly discussed in the field of psychology and family therapy. Various therapists and researchers may use different wording in referring to relationship boundaries, but they are all generally talking about the same thing: where we draw the line with people. Boundaries may be described as, ""Where you end and where others begin,"" or, ""How emotionally close you let people get to you."" They are one measure of relationship health, and can be associated with stress if boundaries are not clear.
 
The bottom line is that setting healthy boundaries in relationships is a key skill for relationship stress management. It is a kindness we can do for ourselves as well as for those we are close to. If boundary-setting isn’t something you are already comfortable with, there is plenty you can do to develop a comfort level with this skill. (And no doubt, you’ll have plenty of opportunities in your life to practice!) These tips on setting personal boundaries can help.
 Maintaining BalanceFor one thing, when we don’t set boundaries on what we will say yes and no to, we tend to take on more responsibilities than we’re comfortable with, just to please others. This can add stress as we try to navigate a lifestyle that is too busy for our comfort level. (Because we know better than anyone what is too much for us and what is not—if we don’t respect our own limits, how can we expect others to respect them, or even know where they lie?) Setting healthy boundaries helps us to maintain the right balance in our schedules and in our lives.

Setting healthy boundaries helps us to maintain the right balance in our schedules and in our lives. Keeping Conflict MinimalAdditionally, when we say yes to things that would be better addressed with a ""no,"" we tend to feel resentful after a while. Some of us may not realize that we have a hand in our own overly-busy schedule, while others of us may be mad at ourselves for letting it happen. Whatever our perceptions, we do know that we feel stressed and that we resent that feeling. (See this for more on how to say no.)If we feel resentful and frustrated by the situation we face, or direct those feelings toward the people who are pushing our boundaries, we can end up feeling alienated from the very people we’re trying to be nice to, or damaging the relationships we’re intending to strengthen. And we all know how much stress relationship conflict can cause! (If you don’t, read this research on conflict in relationships.) Maintaining healthy boundaries lets others know where they stand with us and can allow us to avoid causing additional conflict in our relationships due to resentments and other negative feelings caused by poor boundaries.

Setting Boundaries Actually Promotes ClosenessIt bears mentioning that a common misperception about personal boundaries is that keeping everyone in our lives at an arm’s length is the same as having strong, healthy boundaries. In fact, allowing others to get close to us, without overwhelming us, is the true goal of boundary-setting; healthy boundaries allow us to have close relationships that respect the needs of all involved. Most of us have some people in our lives who require a different type of response, and indeed need to be kept at an arm’s length (or farther) because they do not respect the boundaries we set, but the majority of people can be allowed to get close to us without stepping on our toes—if only we let them know where we stand.

For many people, nothing beats a validating ear and a shoulder to lean on when the going gets tough. Just the act of telling a supportive friend about what's really stressing you can make problems seem more manageable, and can make you feel less alone in dealing with them. If a friend is particularly good at listening and validating, they usually don't even need to offer advice, as the act of feeling heard and understood often helps us get to a point of greater peace where we can access our own wisdom and resources and come up with our own best solutions. For this and other reasons, good friends can make all the difference.
 Social support has been shown by numerous research studies to be a great remedy for stress and is correlated with positive health outcomes, making it a great stress reliever. 
The stress-relieving effects of social support, however, can be diminished by hostility. You may already know this intuitively: when you talk to a friend about something that's bothering you and that friend responds with sarcasm or passive-aggressive hostility, you feel worse rather than better. Not only are you still upset about what was stressing you, but you may now also feel hurt by your friend's lack of empathy, you may doubt your own feelings and inner strength, or both. For this reason, we all tend to learn who we can and can't go to with our problems. Interesting research from Brigham Young University confirms this, finding that, in situations where people were discussing with a friend the negative events that caused them stress, those participants who scored high in hostility (including cynicism and mistrust) had elevated blood pressure compared to the non-hostile participants. This held true both for those giving social support and those receiving it. You may not have realized it, but in avoiding hostile friends when seeking support, you are saving stress for both of you.
 Other research has found that marriages where partners validate each other and share responsibilities are the happiest.  
This makes sense--we spend so much time with our spouses over a lifetime that if you have a partner who shoulders the same burdens you face, it means you both understand how much work you both do; if you have a spouse who is able to support you through stressful times, you both feel less stressed and more at ease as a result, and that means less stress overall. And more good news: these marriages also tend to last. Fortunately, this type of marriage is the most common (a little over half of marriages contain this dynamic), and the support found in these marriages can really relieve stress. 
 
Another study found that the type of listening and emotional support offered could make the difference between more stress and less. For example, if partners went on to offer too much advice, especially if it was unsolicited advice, it created more stress than it relieved. This may seem counterintuitive to a partner who only wants to help minimize the stress by fixing the problem at its root; the problem, however, is twofold: when advice is offered, it is a subtle indication that the ""advisor"" believes that the ""advisee"" cannot come up with their own solutions. Also, the solutions the advisor comes up with may not fit the situation well enough, and this may create stress from both sides as the advice-giver may feel undervalued and the recipient may feel frustrated. Finally, frustration can result for the partner who really just wanted emotional support so they could get to a place where they felt validated and empowered to find their own solutions, but was then faced with another conflict.
 Conversely, it is impossible to receive too much ""esteem support,"" as long as it is genuine. It is more common to receive too little support than to receive too much, but receiving the right type of support is also important, and it doesn't always happen.  
Knowing what type of support to give is vital. And when you give the best type of support in your relationships, you tend to receive it as well. Relationships in which people feel supported and validated tend to have a strong buffering effect against stress.
 
This highlights not only the importance of having good listening skills--being a poor listener can actually make a loved one who's baring their soul feel worse rather than better--but of working hard to foster strong, trusting relationships with the people who are close to us, so we can give and receive social support in ways that are good for everyone. Avoiding conflict is better than engaging in hostile, volatile communication, but it's far healthier and more beneficial to learn healthy communication strategies, be altruistic with one's partner, and work at maintaining relationships in a fun and healthy way. The following are some resources that can help.

The last Saturday in October presents us with a special observance: National Forgiveness Day. July 7th is celebrated as Global Forgiveness Day. These are great opportunities to remind ourselves of the importance of forgiveness, to value the forgiveness that others have offered us in the past, and to focus on forgiving those we may need to forgive—including ourselves.
 
Focusing on forgiveness is important for many reasons. We all know that holding onto anger hurts us more than it hurts the object of that anger. Unresolved anger can create health problems just as unmanaged stress can,﻿﻿ and it robs us of happiness as well. Knowing this, however, doesn't always make the anger magically dissolve. It's sometimes really difficult to forgive.
 
There are a few reasons that forgiveness in practice is much more challenging than forgiveness in theory. Some of the more common reasons (as well as counter-arguments) are:
 
So why does it help to have a special day for forgiveness? We are free to forgive others anytime, and often the best time to do so is right when you realize that you're holding onto anger. However, there are times when it really helps to have a special day to focus on forgiveness. Here's why:
 
So how does one celebrate National Forgiveness Day or any day that we've decided to celebrate as our own forgiveness day? By forgiving anyone and everyone we may be angry with. (And again, if you are reading this on a day other than the official National Forgiveness Day, you absolutely can create your own ""day of forgiveness"" whenever it works for you.) Here are some more specific ideas:
 
Forgiveness can be freeing, but it's always easier said than done. The following forgiveness resources can help:
 
The Powerful Benefits of ForgivenessForgiveness can be a real challenge at times. It can help to motivate yourself to go through the process by arming yourself with a clear understanding of why it's worth the effort. Learn what you'll get out of it when you forgive those who have hurt you.
 
How to ForgiveLike so many things in life, forgiveness is easier said than done. Here are five strategies to help you to go through the journey from wanting to forgive and let go to actually do it!
 They don't deserve it. We think the other person doesn't deserve our forgiveness. (They may not, but we deserve to be free of anger.) The pain is still fresh. When we think about forgiving the other person, we are reminded of what they did, and we become angry all over again. (This reaction will become less intense over time as we work on accepting what happened. This can be a sign that we need to work on this more, however—again, for our own sake, not for theirs.) We think forgiveness means approval. We think forgiving the other person is the same as saying what they did was okay, or that they are welcome to do it again. (This isn't true either. Forgiving means letting go of anger, and of a lack of acceptance of what happened. Forgiving does not mean condoning the behavior, and you can definitely forgive and take steps toward protecting yourself in the future. You can even let go of the relationship but still forgive.) An official reminder. When we're holding onto anger, sometimes we don't realize when we've gotten to the point where we are ready to forgive. Having a special day when we are encouraged to look inward can help us to get to a place of being ready to forgive, or realize that we're already there.  Momentum from a group. It also helps to have the motivation and momentum to get past our personal obstacles to forgiveness and forgive already. Having a day focused on forgiveness, a day that everyone is encouraged to celebrate can provide motivation and momentum at the same time. A fresh start for the holidays. With the holiday season approaching, we may see family and friends we haven't seen for a while; it's good to clear out any anger we may be holding onto so we can celebrate from a fresh and loving place. Take a minute to think about anyone you may be angry with, even if that anger is not fresh. Then decide to let go. If there is a lot to forgive, just let go of as much as you can for now, and work on it again later. Forgive your parents if you're holding onto anger from your childhood. Forgive people you grew up with if you had some childhood experiences you're still angry about. Forgive your spouse or partner if you have any relationship baggage that you're holding onto. If it feels difficult to forgive because you're afraid that you'll open yourself up to getting hurt by them again, realize that the anger itself is hurting you, but you can take steps to change your relationship and the way you are treated in it. Forgive yourself if you're feeling any self-directed anger for anything, such as goals you haven't met, promises to yourself you haven't fulfilled, or mistakes you've made in the past. Just let it all go! If you are unable to get to a place where you can forgive someone or something from the past, and holding onto the associated pain and anger is affecting your wellbeing, you may want to consider working with a professional. Sometimes there are deeper issues to work through, and having the support of a professional can make the process much easier and quicker to move through.",last saturday october present special observance national forgiveness day july celebrate global forgiveness day great opportunities remind importance forgiveness value forgiveness others offer past focus forgive may need forgive include focus forgiveness important many reason know hold onto anger hurt hurt object anger unresolved anger create health problems unmanaged stress rob happiness well know however always make anger magically dissolve sometimes really difficult forgive reason forgiveness practice much challenge forgiveness theory common reason well counter arguments help special day forgiveness free forgive others anytime often best time right realize hold onto anger however time really help special day focus forgiveness one celebrate national forgiveness day day decide celebrate forgiveness day forgive anyone everyone may angry read day official national forgiveness day absolutely create day forgiveness whenever work specific ideas forgiveness free always easier say follow forgiveness resources help powerful benefit forgivenessforgiveness real challenge time help motivate process arm clear understand worth effort learn get forgive hurt forgivelike many things life forgiveness easier say five strategies help journey want forgive let actually deserve think person deserve forgiveness may deserve free anger pain still fresh think forgive person remind become angry reaction become less intense time work accept happen sign need work however sake think forgiveness mean approval think forgive person say okay welcome true either forgive mean let anger lack acceptance happen forgive mean condone behavior definitely forgive take step toward protect future even let relationship still forgive official reminder hold onto anger sometimes realize get point ready forgive special day encourage look inward help get place ready forgive realize already momentum group also help motivation momentum get past personal obstacles forgiveness forgive already day focus forgiveness day everyone encourage celebrate provide motivation momentum time fresh start holiday holiday season approach may see family friends see good clear anger may hold onto celebrate fresh love place take minute think anyone may angry even anger fresh decide let lot forgive let much work later forgive parent hold onto anger childhood forgive people grow childhood experience still angry forgive spouse partner relationship baggage hold onto feel difficult forgive afraid open get hurt realize anger hurt take step change relationship way treat forgive feel self direct anger anything goals meet promise fulfil mistake make past let unable get place forgive someone something past hold onto associate pain anger affect wellbeing may want consider work professional sometimes deeper issue work support professional make process much easier quicker move

Social support has been widely studied as a factor that minimizes the effects on stress, and the results are somewhat striking. Not only does social support help people feel less stressed, but it can also actually improve your health and decrease their mortality risk.﻿﻿ Here’s more of what you need to know about the relationship between your relationships and the effects of stress on your body and mind.
 
We all have a good basic idea of what it means to have social support in one’s life, but when discussing research, it helps to be precise. Social support, when studied by psychologists, is often defined as “acts that communicate caring; that validate the other’s words, feelings or actions; or that facilitate adaptive coping with problems through the provision of information, assistance, or tangible resources”.﻿﻿ There are a few different types of social support, all of which are beneficial. 
 
Not all types of social support are the same. Different forms of support carry different benefits. Here are some of the main types.﻿﻿
 
Social support can be great for your stress levels, making stressful situations less damaging to your mental and physical health. Creating a circle of supportive friends may take a little effort, but it is worth it in terms of benefits to your general health and wellbeing. Creating strong relationships in your life is therefore vital for you and for those you love. You can also find out some ways in which you can cultivate social support as a stress reliever.
 Emotional Social Support includes affirmations of one’s worth, concern about one’s feelings, and the sharing of positive regard. This falls along the lines of listening to and validating feelings, letting others know they are valued, and offering a shoulder to cry on. Informational Social Support involves the sharing of advice or information that can help someone who is experiencing a stressor or challenge they don’t know how to handle. This includes offering advice that people may find useful, pointing people to experts who may offer advice, and sharing experiences. Tangible Social Support includes sharing resources, either material or financial. Obviously, this can include providing loans of monetary gifts, but it can also involve offers to share childcare duties, helping a friend move, or even bringing a casserole to a grieving family. Belonging Social Support involves providing social leisure and belonging. This means including friends in the group, and spending time with friends who need support and may feel alone. One study from the University of Utah examined the effects of three of these different types of social support among married couples and found that emotional, tangible, and informational support all helped lower blood pressure when individuals were faced with short-term stressors.﻿﻿ Another study that analyzed 148 smaller studies showed a definitive finding that social support is heavily linked with health and wellbeing.﻿﻿ In examining the link between social support and mortality, the research found a surprising 50% increased likelihood of survival for participants with stronger relationships. This finding remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status, cause of death, and follow-up period. Research has documented many physiological and mental health benefits of social support, including improved immune, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine function; positive adjustment to chronic disease; decreased depression and anxiety; and effective buffering against the negative effects of stress.﻿﻿ Sadly, many people are more socially isolated than they’d like to be, despite perhaps having connections to acquaintances through social media. Researchers measure the closeness of relationships in different ways, but many of these measures show “social poverty” or a lack of social support.﻿﻿ It is possible to have a large group of acquaintances but still feels lonely, and many people do. If you're feeling a lack of social connection with others, you're not alone.",social support widely study factor minimize effect stress result somewhat strike social support help people feel less stress also actually improve health decrease mortality risk need know relationship relationships effect stress body mind good basic idea mean social support one life discuss research help precise social support study psychologists often define act communicate care validate word feel action facilitate adaptive cop problems provision information assistance tangible resources different type social support beneficial type social support different form support carry different benefit main type social support great stress level make stressful situations less damage mental physical health create circle supportive friends may take little effort worth term benefit general health wellbeing create strong relationships life therefore vital love also find ways cultivate social support stress reliever emotional social support include affirmations one worth concern one feel share positive regard fall along line listen validate feel let others know value offer shoulder cry informational social support involve share advice information help someone experience stressor challenge know handle include offer advice people may find useful point people experts may offer advice share experience tangible social support include share resources either material financial obviously include provide loan monetary gift also involve offer share childcare duties help friend move even bring casserole grieve family belong social support involve provide social leisure belong mean include friends group spend time friends need support may feel alone one study university utah examine effect three different type social support among marry couple find emotional tangible informational support help lower blood pressure individuals face short term stressors another study analyze smaller study show definitive find social support heavily link health wellbeing examine link social support mortality research find surprise increase likelihood survival participants stronger relationships find remain consistent across age sex initial health status cause death follow period research document many physiological mental health benefit social support include improve immune cardiovascular neuroendocrine function positive adjustment chronic disease decrease depression anxiety effective buffer negative effect stress sadly many people socially isolate like despite perhaps connections acquaintances social media researchers measure closeness relationships different ways many measure show social poverty lack social support possible large group acquaintances still feel lonely many people feel lack social connection others alone

A very telling study found that women report involvement with the social media site Pinterest as being stressful. The key stressor here is the social comparison that they find themselves engaging in. There are so many amazing projects to do, crafts to make, and ways to look at life, women find themselves feeling lacking. As one friend recently put it, ""It's the Martha Stewart Living of social media sites!"" Some people find Pinterest to be so engaging that it can eat up hours in their day that they had not planned to devote to social media, making a busy schedule much busier. However, the main stressor with Pinterest is people feeling that they do not measure up.
 
Another trend that can be stressful for people is the phenomenon of people posting about their peak moments on social media sites like Facebook, but leaving off the negative events and drudgery—a somewhat common phenomenon that has been termed by one clever blogger as, ""Facebooking."" It is natural for us to want to share our best moments with others, just as it is natural to avoid ""airing our dirty laundry"" or ""Garfielding"" (simply complaining about everything inconvenient in life, including Mondays) for fear of chasing off our friends.
 Time on social media lead to stress when people compare the exciting and blissful events they see in their Facebook feed (the highest moments in their friends' lives) with their own stressors (the lowest moments in their own lives). 
Social comparison is nothing new—it wasn't invented by social media, to be sure. However, situations like social media sites bring it into high relief. How can we enjoy the benefits of social media—the bonding, the humor, the sharing of news—but avoid the stressors that come with social media social comparison and ""Fakebooking""? Here are a few ideas:
 
Intellectually, we know that many people share their best moments on social media and keep their worst moments to themselves, but when all we see are the best of others, we can forget. It may help to remind yourself of this often.
 
It may also help to talk to your friends and be authentic; you may not want to post your personal challenges on social media for the world to see, but you can certainly talk to your friends in private and share your triumphs and your challenges. You can help each other this way. (And if most of your friends are competitive enough that they would rather share only their triumphs, find new friends who will share their challenges as well, and support you in yours.)
 
The technique of cognitive reframing can be quite helpful with stress. It can work well with sites like Pinterest as well. Rather than looking at the beautiful crafting ideas, clothing patterns, or workout plans on Pinterest as something you ""should"" be doing, view these ""pins"" as ""inspiration,"" or ""ideas for when life slows down."" If you can get inspired by what you see, this can be a fun diversion; if you feel inadequate when you look at certain pins, either change your perspective or stop looking at those types of pins. (Here are some more tips on how to reframe your stress.)
 
If you find the stress of social media comes from the sheer time you spend using it, or the importance you place on it, it might be time to take a break (either cut down on your screen time for a while or take a few days off) and plug back into your life.

Relationships offer wonderful benefits for wellbeing, life satisfaction, and stress management, but none are without their challenges. These issues can put a strain on a couple, but working through them can either strengthen their bond or push them apart, depending on how they handle the challenges they face.
 
Working through marriage problems in a healthy way can be very difficult, especially because stressors in a marriage can come from many different sources. The following are some of the most common sources of marital stress and marriage problems.
 
The stress of fighting over money constitutes one of the most oft-cited marriage problems that couples face. Generally speaking, when couples engage in conflicts about money, their dispute is really symbolic of something different—power struggles, different values and needs, or other issues that surround money.
 
However, in tough economic times, financial stress can actually cause more general stress, more conflict over things unrelated to money, and well as money-centered arguments as well. (For example, when one partner is extremely stressed about money, they may be less patient and more stressed in general; they may then pick fights with the other partner about unrelated things without even realizing it!)
 
The advent of children brings another potential source of marriage problems. Children are wonderful, and can bring wonderful and meaningful gifts into our lives. However, having children can bring additional stress into a marriage because the caretaking of children requires more responsibility as well as a change in roles, provides more fodder for disagreement and strain, and reduces the amount of time available to bond as a couple. This combination can test even the strongest of bonds.
 
Daily stressors don’t need to equal marriage problems, but they can exacerbate problems that already exist. When one partner has had a stressful day, they may be more likely to be impatient when they get home, they may handle conflict less expertly, and may have less emotional energy to devote to nurturing their partner and their relationship.
 
When both partners have had a difficult day, this of course is only exacerbated. As with financial stress, general daily stress can test patience and optimism, leaving couples with less to give to one another emotionally.
 
Marriage problems can result from overly busy schedules for a few reasons. First, couples who are very busy may find themselves generally stressed as well, especially if they’re not taking care of themselves with quality sleep and good nutrition.
 
Additionally, they may find themselves less connected because they have less time to spend together and more separateness in their lives. Finally, if they don’t work together as a team (even if their responsibilities are completely separate if they don’t coordinate to cover all responsibilities well), they may find themselves fighting over who’s taking care of which household and social responsibilities.
 
Again, while busy schedules don’t automatically lead to marriage problems, they do present a challenge that needs to be worked through.
 
Perhaps the biggest predictor of marriage problems is poor communication or negative communication that belies damaging attitudes and dynamics within the relationship.
 Negative communication is so damaging, in fact, that researcher John Gottman and his team have been able to predict with a very high degree of certainty which newlywed couples would later divorce, based on watching their communication dynamics for a few minutes. 
Healthy communication is key; unhealthy communication can lead to major marriage problems.
 
Sometimes couples experience marriage problems that could be solved if the two could notice their habits and change them. People don't always make a conscious decision to argue over petty things, nag and be critical, or leave messes for the other to clean, for example.
 
They get busy or distracted, stress builds, and they go on autopilot. Then they find themselves following the same patterns they hadn't realized they were choosing in the first place.
 People just get into negative patterns of relating, fall into lazy personal habits, or get into a rut that they perpetuate out of habit. 
Fortunately, these marriage problems can be worked on. Even if only one partner is consciously trying to change, any change can bring a shift in the dynamic of the relationship, which can bring positive results.

Although forgiveness brings many benefits, particularly to the ‘forgiver,’ to forgive is not always easy. In fact, many people who would like to let go of anger and forgive are stumped with the question of how to forgive. While everyone may have a unique perspective on how to forgive, the following strategies have been proven effective for a variety of people.
 
In contemplating how to forgive someone, it may or may not help to express your feelings to the other person. If the relationship is important to you and you would like to maintain it, it may be very useful for you to tell the other person—in non-threatening language—how their actions affected you (see this article on conflict resolution for tips). If the person is no longer in your life, if you want to cut off the relationship, or if you have reason to believe that things will get much worse if you address the situation directly, you may want to just write a letter and tear it up (or burn it) and move on. It still may help to put your feelings into words as part of letting go.
 People don’t need to know that you’ve forgiven them; forgiveness is more for you than for the other person. 
Journaling about a situation where you were hurt or wronged can help you process what happened and move on; however, the way you write about it and what you choose to focus on can make all the difference in how easy it becomes to forgive. Research shows that journaling about the benefits you’ve gotten from a negative situation—rather than focusing on the emotions you have surrounding the event, or writing about something unrelated—can actually help you to forgive and move on more easily.﻿﻿ So pick up a pen and start journaling about the silver lining next time you find someone raining on your parade, or keep an ongoing gratitude journal and forgive a little every day.
 
While you don’t have to agree with what the other person did to you, when working on how to forgive, it often helps to put yourself in the other person’s shoes. Research has shown that empathy, particularly with men, is associated with forgiveness, and can make the process easier.﻿﻿ Instead of seeing them as ""the enemy,"" try to understand the factors that they were dealing with. Were they going through a particularly difficult time in their lives? Have you ever made similar mistakes? Try to remember the other person’s good qualities, assume that their motives were not to purposely cause you pain (unless you have clear indicators otherwise), and you may find it easier to forgive.
 
You've likely heard the saying: ""First time, shame on you; second time, shame on me."" Sometimes it’s difficult to forgive if you feel that forgiveness leaves you open to future repeats of the same negative treatment. It’s important to understand that forgiveness is not the same as condoning the offending action, and it’s OK (and sometimes vital) to include self-protective plans for the future as part of your forgiveness process.
 
For example, if you have a co-worker who continually steals your ideas, belittles you in front of the group, or gossips about you, such ongoing negative behavior can be difficult to forgive. However, you can make a plan to address the behavior with human resources, move to another department, or switch jobs to get out of the negative situation.
 Blanket forgiveness of someone who is continuing to hurt you isn’t necessarily a good idea for your emotional health. 
Letting go of your anger and trying to forgive will bring the benefits of forgiveness without opening you up to further abuse. You don’t need to hold a grudge in order to protect yourself.
 
Sometimes it can be difficult to forget about the past and forgive, particularly if the offending acts were ongoing or traumatic. If you’re still having difficulty knowing how to forgive someone who’s wronged you in a significant way, you may have better success working with a therapist who can help you work through your feelings on a deeper level and personally support you through the process.
 
When you’ve been hurt, figuring out how to forgive can be difficult. These strategies should be helpful in your journey of letting go and releasing the stress of the past.

Many people have complicated feelings about apologies, and not all of our thoughts and feelings about apologies line up. Some of us were forced to apologize as children when we hurt someone, and some of us apologized freely and felt immediately better after having done so. Some people feel shamed by apologizing while others feel ashamed until we have done so.
 
While a popular movie from decades ago declared that ""Love means never having to say you're sorry,"" many relationship experts warn that never apologizing in a relationship is a sure way to risk losing it.
 
We may have learned about the need for apologizing when we've hurt a friend—accidentally or otherwise—but do you know why apologizing is really important, and what function a good apology serves? Researchers and psychologists have pinpointed some important reasons why apologizing is necessary when social rules have been violated.
 
Some of the good things that come from a sincere apology:
 
Relationships can be great sources of stress relief, but conflict can cause considerable stress, which really takes a toll. Learn the art of apologizing effectively and you may find a significant reduction in the negative effects of conflict and relationship stress because apologies help us put the conflict behind us and move on more easily.
 
There are many benefits that come from forgiveness in terms of and happiness and stress relief as well. In these ways, being adept at apologizing when appropriate can bring the benefits that come with stronger relationships, reduced conflict, and forgiveness—it's well worth the effort.
 
For some people, an apology often feels like an admission that they are inadequate—that, rather than having made a mistake, there is something inherently wrong with them.
 
Others believe that offering the first apology after an argument is an admission of guilt and responsibility for the entirety of a conflict that involved wrongs on the part of both parties; they think an apology from them will allow the other person to take no responsibility for their own part in the conflict. Sometimes an apology seems to call added attention to a mistake that may have gone unnoticed.
 
However, in the right circumstances, a well-delivered, appropriately sincere apology will generally avoid all of these issues, and will merely serve to usher in a resolution, reaffirm shared values, and restore positive feelings. You just have to know when and how to deliver your apology.
 
If something you've done has caused pain for another person, it's a good idea to apologize, even if whatever you did was unintentional. This is because apologizing opens up the doors to communication, which allows you to reconnect with the person who was hurt.
 
It also allows you to express regret that they have been hurt, which lets them know you really care about their feelings. This can help them feel safer with you again.
 Apologizing also allows you to discuss what the ""rules"" should be in the future, especially if a new one needs to be made, which is often the case when you didn't hurt the other person intentionally. 
Creating new rules for the relationship can help you be protected from getting hurt in the future as well. Basically, if you care about the other person and the relationship, and you can avoid offending behavior in the future, an apology is usually a good idea.
 
This doesn't mean that you need to take responsibility for things that were not your fault. For example, you can express regret at unintentionally hurting someone's feelings, but you don't have to say you ""should have known better"" if you truly feel there is no way you could have known they would be hurt by your actions—this is where creating a new rule can help.
 
(For example, ""I'm sorry I woke you! Now that I know you don't want people to call you after 8 p.m., I will be careful not to do so."")
 Taking responsibility also means specifying what you did that you believe was wrong, but can entail gently mentioning what you believe was not wrong on your part. 
In this way, you protect yourself from the feeling that if you are the first to apologize, you are taking responsibility for the whole conflict, or for the bulk of it.
 
It is also important to remember that an apology can include a simple statement such as ""I am sorry that you felt that way."" An apology does not necessarily have to involve stating that you did something wrong. Instead, it may be an acknowledgment that you hurt another person.
 
Sometimes when you don't see eye to eye with another individual, an apology will turn into another argument. (""I am sorry, but....""). You can avoid this kind of circular argument by just acknowledging someone else's feelings and that you hurt them. 
 
It is important to note that apologies that involve empty promises are a bad idea. One of the important functions of an apology is that it affords the opportunity to re-establish trust; resolving not to repeat the offending behavior—or to make whatever change is possible—is an important part of an apology.
 If you promise to change but then don't, the apology merely calls attention to the fact that you've done something even you agree is wrong, but refuse to change. 
Don't make promises you can't keep, but do try to make reasonable promises to avoid hurting the person in the future, and the follow through on those promises. If the other person is expecting something unreasonable or impossible, perhaps you're taking responsibility for more than you need to.
 
An insincere apology can often do more damage than no apology at all. When you are apologizing, it is important to include a few key ingredients so you can apologize sincerely. They should help you to maintain healthy, happy relationships with your friends, family and loved ones.
 Apologizing when you've broken a rule of social conduct—from cutting in line to breaking the law—re-establishes that you know what the ""rules"" are, and you agree that they should be upheld. This allows others to feel safe knowing you agree that hurtful behavior isn't OK. Apologies re-establish dignity for those you hurt. Letting the injured party know that you know it was your fault, not theirs, helps them feel better, and it helps them save face. Apologizing helps repair relationships by getting people talking again, and makes them feel comfortable with each other again. A sincere apology allows you to let people know you're not proud of what you did, and won't be repeating the behavior. That lets people know you're the kind of person who is generally careful not to hurt others and puts the focus on your better virtues, rather than on your worst mistakes.",many people complicate feel apologies thoughts feel apologies line force apologize children hurt someone apologize freely felt immediately better people feel sham apologize others feel ashamed popular movie decades ago declare love mean never say sorry many relationship experts warn never apologize relationship sure way risk lose may learn need apologize hurt friend accidentally otherwise know apologize really important function good apology serve researchers psychologists pinpoint important reason apologize necessary social rule violate good things come sincere apology relationships great source stress relief conflict cause considerable stress really take toll learn art apologize effectively may find significant reduction negative effect conflict relationship stress apologies help put conflict behind move easily many benefit come forgiveness term happiness stress relief well ways adept apologize appropriate bring benefit come stronger relationships reduce conflict forgiveness well worth effort people apology often feel like admission inadequate rather make mistake something inherently wrong others believe offer first apology argument admission guilt responsibility entirety conflict involve wrong part party think apology allow person take responsibility part conflict sometimes apology seem call add attention mistake may unnoticed however right circumstances well deliver appropriately sincere apology generally avoid issue merely serve usher resolution reaffirm share value restore positive feel know deliver apology something cause pain another person good idea apologize even whatever unintentional apologize open doors communication allow reconnect person hurt also allow express regret hurt let know really care feel help feel safer apologize also allow discuss rule future especially new one need make often case hurt person intentionally create new rule relationship help protect get hurt future well basically care person relationship avoid offend behavior future apology usually good idea mean need take responsibility things fault example express regret unintentionally hurt someone feel say know better truly feel way could know would hurt action create new rule help example sorry wake know want people call careful take responsibility also mean specify believe wrong entail gently mention believe wrong part way protect feel first apologize take responsibility whole conflict bulk also important remember apology include simple statement sorry felt way apology necessarily involve state something wrong instead may acknowledgment hurt another person sometimes see eye eye another individual apology turn another argument sorry avoid kind circular argument acknowledge someone else feel hurt important note apologies involve empty promise bad idea one important function apology afford opportunity establish trust resolve repeat offend behavior make whatever change possible important part apology promise change apology merely call attention fact something even agree wrong refuse change make promise keep try make reasonable promise avoid hurt person future follow promise person expect something unreasonable impossible perhaps take responsibility need insincere apology often damage apology apologize important include key ingredients apologize sincerely help maintain healthy happy relationships friends family love ones apologize break rule social conduct cut line break law establish know rule agree uphold allow others feel safe know agree hurtful behavior apologies establish dignity hurt let injure party know know fault help feel better help save face apologize help repair relationships get people talk make feel comfortable sincere apology allow let people know proud repeat behavior let people know kind person generally careful hurt others put focus better virtues rather worst mistake

Studies on social support show that having one or two close and supportive friends is at least as valuable to emotional health as having a large group of friendly acquaintances or more shallow friendships. However, having social support from several supportive friends would be the best of both worlds. You probably already know if you're more comfortable with one good friend or many, but there are some good reasons to have at least a few different friends to fall back on:
 
If you’re not still in school or working for a large company with a built-in social structure and constant opportunities to meet new people, it’s still easy to build new friendships. Here are a few ways to meet new people:
 Joining a class geared toward your interests ensures you’ll improve yourself, and you’ll meet people with whom you already have something in common! If you have only one person supporting you through difficult times, you may wear that person out, or feel unsupported if that person is unavailable. It’s better for everyone if you have at least a few people to depend on. You draw different benefits from different types of people. Having an outgoing friend to party with, a knowledgeable friend to gain information and insights from, and an empathic friend to be a good listener during tough times, for example, provides a better blend of social support than any one of these people alone could give. Your friends can bring out different qualities in one another that benefit all of you. For example, your outgoing friend could bring your shy empathic friend out of her shell, and the three of you could go out and party together. Plus, your friends can introduce you to more friends, giving you a greater pool of pre-screened potential friends. Studies show that a sense of belonging is extremely important for emotional health and well-being; those who have social support but don't feel a sense of belonging are much more likely to suffer from depression, for example. Join a Gym: If you’re not comfortable striking up a conversation with the person on the next Stairmaster, most gyms offer yoga, aerobics or even martial arts classes, which provide a more intimate setting and opportunities to meet people, perhaps finding a workout buddy. Get Involved in a Hobby: If you enjoy making things with your hands, perhaps you can enroll in a community art class. If you like writing, a writer’s workshop will provide a great opportunity to improve your writing skills and get to know other writers at the same time.  Volunteer! Getting involved with a charity you believe in will give you a sense of doing something positive to help the world, which has a great way of relieving stress in itself, and you’ll meet others with similarly big hearts and great passion for helping. Get a Pet: Not only will you derive physical and emotional benefits from being a pet owner, but you can also meet others at dog parks or pet stores. There are even park days for passionate rabbit owners! Let your ‘best friend’ help you connect with other (human) friends. Have a Party: If you invite all of your current friends and encourage each to bring a friend, you’ll have a pool of new people to meet. Plus, you may inspire your friends to throw their own parties, where you’ll meet even more new people. Smile! This one may sound simple, but if you give off an ‘approachable vibe’, you may find that you’re striking up conversations with new people wherever you go. Not all these conversations need to lead to a new friendship, but some might, and just one warm exchange with someone new can brighten up your day (and theirs)!",study social support show one two close supportive friends least valuable emotional health large group friendly acquaintances shallow friendships however social support several supportive friends would best worlds probably already know comfortable one good friend many good reason least different friends fall back still school work large company build social structure constant opportunities meet new people still easy build new friendships ways meet new people join class gear toward interest ensure improve meet people already something common one person support difficult time may wear person feel unsupported person unavailable better everyone least people depend draw different benefit different type people outgo friend party knowledgeable friend gain information insights empathic friend good listener tough time example provide better blend social support one people alone could give friends bring different qualities one another benefit example outgo friend could bring shy empathic friend shell three could party together plus friends introduce friends give greater pool pre screen potential friends study show sense belong extremely important emotional health well social support feel sense belong much likely suffer depression example join gym comfortable strike conversation person next stairmaster gyms offer yoga aerobics even martial arts class provide intimate set opportunities meet people perhaps find workout buddy get involve hobby enjoy make things hand perhaps enroll community art class like write writer workshop provide great opportunity improve write skills get know writers time volunteer get involve charity believe give sense something positive help world great way relieve stress meet others similarly big hearts great passion help get pet derive physical emotional benefit pet owner also meet others dog park pet store even park days passionate rabbit owners let best friend help connect human friends party invite current friends encourage bring friend pool new people meet plus may inspire friends throw party meet even new people smile one may sound simple give approachable vibe may find strike conversations new people wherever conversations need lead new friendship might one warm exchange someone new brighten day

Times of crisis and stress strike unexpectedly and hit hard. Because of the physical and emotional effects of stress, it’s important for us to have some stress management strategies in place when a crisis does hit. Because the effects of stress can be contagious, relieving stress shouldn’t be a burden for anyone to carry alone. Having a friend during a stressful life event can make a huge difference.
 
But knowing how to help a friend, however, can be tricky. Here are some strategies for offering support to family members and friends in need:
 
There’s a reason why bringing food is the classic ""good neighbor gesture:"" It’s appropriate for a wide range of relationships, from very close to a mere acquaintance, and it really does help people feel better when they’re going through a crisis. Bring your own meal and drop it off, or help coordinate the food-bringing efforts of your group (so the whole neighborhood doesn’t all show up with food on the same night), and you’re doing a real service.
 
When people experience crisis, they’re often overwhelmed. Just getting from one day to the next can be challenging and draining. Offering to lend whatever type of hand they might need can be a wonderful way of supporting your friend. Whether it’s taking out the trash for a neighbor, grocery shopping for a friend, or taking your mom’s dog to the vet, helping with the daily tasks that may prove to be too much for someone in crisis is an excellent way to help.
 
When faced with an illness or crisis, or when you’re a caregiver, it’s possible to become so consumed with the crisis that it’s difficult to get out and do things that would relieve stress, like exercising or seeing a movie. As a supportive friend, sometimes it helps just to take a loved one out and help then get away for a few hours. Taking someone to dinner, for a walk in the park, or to see an uplifting film can be a fun way to lend support.
 
Sometimes you can’t find a solution or fix people’s problems. Sometimes all you can do is listen. Fortunately, that’s enough to make a big difference most of the time. (In fact, sometimes a good, supportive listener is far more comforting than the best advice-giver!)
 Lending a supportive ear or a shoulder to cry on can be more difficult than it sounds (which is part of why therapists are in demand), but it can be transformative to the friend who needs a good listener. 
If you’re close enough with someone, and you see that they may need more support than you can provide, you may want to point them in the direction of other resources in addition to offering what help you can. Helping them find a therapist or support group, or other resources available in the community, can be beneficial for people who are too overwhelmed to look on their own, or need an outside perspective to recognize when they need additional help.
 
Even small gestures can help a friend or neighbor manage a very difficult time. Being there can help them de-stress and help their health.

Every time you reach for the phone when you’ve had a bad day, accept help when you’re overwhelmed, or even search online to get information from someone on how to handle a stressor, you’re demonstrating that you know what research has repeatedly shown: that different types of social support can really help with stress! However, all types of social support don’t affect us the same—a long talk with an empathic friend feels different from a talk with someone who has plenty of advice to offer, and those types of social support feel different from the type of support a coach or therapist might offer. Is there a best type of social support? And how do the different types of social support affect us?
 
While there are many different ways that people can support one another, much research has been done on the effects of four distinct types of social support:
 
All of these types of social support ‘work’, but not with everybody, and not in the same ways. Different people have preferences for a certain type or a combination or a few types of social support. It’s important to note, however, that the wrong type of support can actually have a detrimental effect, so it helps to know what type of social support is needed in each situation.
 
Here’s some of what the research has found:
 
The important thing to remember is that there are different types of social support and that you may need to ask for the specific type you need, especially in marriage. ""The idea that simply being more supportive is better for your marriage is a myth,"" says Erika Lawrence, associate professor of psychology in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and lead researcher in these studies. ""Often husbands and wives think, ""If my partner really knows me and loves me, he or she will know I'm upset and will know how to help me."" However, that's not the best way to approach your marriage. Your partner shouldn't have to be a mind reader. Couples will be happier if they learn how to say, 'This is how I'm feeling, and this is how you can help me.'""
 
Don’t assume that you know what type of support your spouse, friends or relatives crave; it’s always best to check-in with people to see if the support you’re offering is hitting the mark. If not, it’s important to open up a discussion to see what types of social support are needed here. And be aware of what types of support feel the best for you, so you can communicate this to your loved ones as well. It’s not fair to expect people to read your mind when it comes to social support—and it’s not effective either. Just ask for what you need.
 Emotional Support: This type of support often involves physical comfort such as hugs or pats on the back, as well as listening and empathizing. With emotional support, a friend or spouse might give you a big hug and listen to your problems, letting you know that they’ve felt the same way, too. Esteem Support: This type of social support is shown in expressions of confidence or encouragement. Someone offering esteem support might point out the strengths you’re forgetting you have, or just let you know that they believe in you. Life coaches and many therapists offer this type of support to let their clients know that they believe in them; this often leads to clients believing in themselves more. Informational Support: Those offering informational support do so in the form of advice-giving, or in gathering and sharing information that can help people know of potential next steps that may work well. Tangible Support:  Tangible support includes taking on responsibilities for someone else so they can deal with a problem or in other ways taking an active stance to help someone manage a problem they’re experiencing. Someone who offers you tangible support may bring you dinner when you’re sick, help you brainstorm solutions (rather than telling you what you should do, as with informational support), or in other ways help you actively deal with the issue at hand. You really can have too much support! One study, which involved 103 husbands and wives who completed surveys five times over their first five years of marriage, looked at how support was provided and measured marital satisfaction. It found that too much informational support (usually in the form of unsolicited advice) can actually be worse than no support at all. (I found it reassuring, however, that you can’t give too much esteem support; no amount of esteem support is ‘too much’, as long as it’s genuine.) Too little support is more common than too much. The same study found that about two-thirds of men and at least 80% of women found themselves receiving too little support, whereas just one-third of men and women said that they were receiving more support than they wanted. Another study, which examined 235 newlyweds, found that both partners are happier if the husband gets the types of social support he needs most. For women, it was enough that the husband was just trying to offer support, even if he didn’t always offer the right kind.",every time reach phone bad day accept help overwhelm even search online get information someone handle stressor demonstrate know research repeatedly show different type social support really help stress however type social support affect long talk empathic friend feel different talk someone plenty advice offer type social support feel different type support coach therapist might offer best type social support different type social support affect many different ways people support one another much research effect four distinct type social support type social support work everybody ways different people preferences certain type combination type social support important note however wrong type support actually detrimental effect help know type social support need situation research find important thing remember different type social support may need ask specific type need especially marriage idea simply supportive better marriage myth say erika lawrence associate professor psychology college liberal arts sciences lead researcher study often husband wive think partner really know love know upset know help however best way approach marriage partner mind reader couple happier learn say feel help assume know type support spouse friends relatives crave always best check people see support offer hit mark important open discussion see type social support need aware type support feel best communicate love ones well fair expect people read mind come social support effective either ask need emotional support type support often involve physical comfort hug pat back well listen empathize emotional support friend spouse might give big hug listen problems let know felt way esteem support type social support show expressions confidence encouragement someone offer esteem support might point strengths forget let know believe life coach many therapists offer type support let clients know believe often lead clients believe informational support offer informational support form advice give gather share information help people know potential next step may work well tangible support tangible support include take responsibilities someone else deal problem ways take active stance help someone manage problem experience someone offer tangible support may bring dinner sick help brainstorm solutions rather tell informational support ways help actively deal issue hand really much support one study involve husband wive complete survey five time first five years marriage look support provide measure marital satisfaction find much informational support usually form unsolicited advice actually worse support find reassure however give much esteem support amount esteem support much long genuine little support common much study find two thirds men least women find receive little support whereas one third men women say receive support want another study examine newlyweds find partner happier husband get type social support need women enough husband try offer support even always offer right kind

Coping with a major change, stressor or crisis can be taxing for adults; for many kids, such things can be overwhelming. Because children don’t have the coping skills that the typical adult has taken a lifetime to develop, helping kids develop coping skills for dealing with crises and major stressors is a vital responsibility that can benefit children and the adults who love them. Rather than merely telling them everything will be okay, it helps to really talk to them and demonstrate how to cope with stress so that they'll know what to do when they feel stress as adults—and when their children feel it. This sets up the next several generations to be more capable of coping.
 
The following are some simple and effective strategies for helping kids cope with tough times:
 
Every parent knows that kids thrive on positive adult attention. When helping kids in coping with difficult times, it’s important to remember this, and give extra attention to kids even if they aren’t formally asking for it. It can be especially difficult during times of crisis to free up extra time to spend on kids—the natural tendency is often for kids to get lost in the shuffle—but this is the time when kids may need your attention the most. Here are some ways to help kids cope by providing extra attention:
 
While you can’t completely shield your children from whatever crises you face (even if they’re not directly involved, kids are notorious for picking up on stressful situations their parents face, as if by osmosis), you can do other things to minimize their exposure to the stress. This can help them learn ways of minimizing their own exposure to stress later in life—another good coping skill to have. Here are some strategies to try:
 
For better or for worse, when facing a threat, your kids look to you to see what to do. No adult is perfect, but being a good role model for crisis management doesn’t require perfection, just your best efforts. And an adult who copes in a healthy way provides a sense of safety and stability for kids and models healthy coping skills to emulate. Here are some ways you can help your children by focusing on yourself.
 
Above all, remember that you may not be able to change all of the circumstances they face, but you can empower them with coping skills and help them navigate what they face, and sharpen your own coping skills at the same time.
 ListeningWhile this isn’t true in every case, it’s often helpful for kids to be able to express their feelings and concerns, ask questions about what to expect, and just feel that they’re not facing things alone. Sitting down and having a heart-to-heart with a focus on listening can help kids practice processing their emotions, a healthy coping skill they can use again and again.

Shared ActivitiesSome children aren’t as comfortable just opening up about their thoughts and feelings, and can be encouraged to talk things out by getting involved in a shared activity. Many parents of boys already know that it may take a game of catch or even a fishing trip to get their sons to talk about what’s on their mind. Girls can benefit from some quiet time with a parent as well. And even if it doesn’t involve a personal talk about feelings, spending time with a parent and doing comforting activities can be great for stress relief. Knowing how to engage in calming activities when stressed is another great coping skill to have.

Being AwareAnother benefit of spending extra time with kids is that you’re better able to see how they’re faring and to intervene if necessary. For example, if you see major signs of withdrawal, difficulties with sleeping and eating, or other significant changes in behavior, you’ll know when to step in with extra help at home, and when it might be a good idea to consult your pediatrician or therapist. It's important to know what is ""normal"" for your child so you will be able to detect any important changes in their mood or behavior.

With the availability of online, there’s no need to have disconcerting scenes played and replayed in your living room. Even very young children can pick up on extra stress from this by noting the stress in the adults around them and on screen.

Maintain RoutinesWhen everything seems to be changing (or falling apart) around you, it may be difficult to keep routines intact. However, it’s a good idea to try. It can be reassuring to kids (and perhaps to you, too) to have as many things remain constant as possible, so it’s worth the effort to have bedtimes, meal times, and other family activities stay the same.

Be Careful What You ShareWhen facing a crisis, kids want to know how things will affect them, and they ask a lot of questions. Not every question asked requires an answer, and many are better off being answered in a limited capacity. While it’s not a good idea to lie to kids, they don’t need to know all the details of a divorce, natural disaster or serious illness. They just need to know what affects them, what they directly need to prepare for, and what’s appropriate for their age. They can learn the rest gradually when they need to know, and as they mature and are able to handle more.

Try to be prepared as possible. Focus on what needs to be done, and be gentle with yourself. Don’t forget to breathe. And spend as much time relaxing with your kids as possible.

Setting boundaries aren’t always easy. The process itself—letting people know where your needs and limits are—can often be stressful, especially for those who aren’t used to it. When people are used to relationship boundaries that are at a certain point, they can put up a fight if you try to change your boundaries with them, and people (like children) often try to test boundaries among one another. This can all be stressful, especially when you take into account the toll of conflict on stress levels. However, the end result can be well worth it: relationships that involve greater levels of mutual respect, that meet the needs of all parties involved, and that create much less stress for everyone.
 
The first step in setting boundaries is to gain an understanding of where your own personal boundaries lie. How comfortable are you with people getting close to you and taking certain liberties with you? Often, your first clue is the feeling you get when your boundaries have been violated. Because different people have different boundaries, something that bothers others may not bother you, and vice versa. Therefore, it’s important to communicate to others where your comfort levels (and discomfort levels) lie so that people with different boundaries may be able to keep from violating yours. The following are general guidelines to help you to become more aware of your own personal boundaries.
 
There are additional questions you should ask yourself when you are looking at specific choices you can make, rather than your feelings in general, that can help you to decide whether or not a boundary needs to be set. The following questions can help you to clarify your boundaries in specific situations, and navigate through future ones:
 
Once you’ve determined how you are feeling, you can decide if you do indeed wish to set a boundary. In a perfect world, once we are aware of where our personal comfort zones lie, we need simply to communicate that information to others, and a relationship boundary is set. However, quite often in the real world, boundary-setting involves some negotiation, and it doesn’t always go smoothly. People have boundaries of their own that may not match, and they may push for greater distance or closeness for their own reasons. Changing boundaries from the status quo can also cause people to react by trying to reinforce the previous or existing boundaries, sometimes in ways that make us uncomfortable. In this way, setting boundaries can be a struggle.
 Because we need to think of our own needs as well as the needs and reactions of others, it’s important to be circumspect in setting boundaries. 
The questions to ask yourself when discovering where your personal boundaries lie are different from the questions may ask yourself when deciding where to actually set your boundaries in specific situations, because they take into account practical factors like the “cost” of setting boundaries. They also allow you to be clear on issues such as guilt (should you feel guilty?) and motivation (is it worth it?) so you can move forward with the least amount of stress. Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 
It is important to note that you will likely be weighing your own feelings more heavily than the feelings of others because you must live with the consequences of your decisions. You are also the one who will have to live with the consequences of your choices. Ultimately, we all have our own comfort levels for boundaries, but these questions provide food for thought. Once you've decided where to set your boundary, working on boundary-setting strategies and assertive communication techniques can bring some nice results in your life.​
 You feel resentful of people asking too much of you, and it seems to happen often. You find yourself saying yes to things you’d rather not do, just to avoid upsetting or disappointing others. You find yourself feeling resentful because you are doing more for others than they are doing for you. You tend to keep most people at an arm’s length because you are afraid of letting people get too close and overwhelming you. You find yourself feeling that most of what you do is for other people—and they may not even appreciate it that much. The stress you feel from disappointing others is greater than the stress of doing things that inconvenience or drain you in an effort to please them. If nobody would be disappointed, would you prefer to say yes or no? Looking at all the benefits and costs of this situation (both tangible and intangible), is it worth the effort to say yes? Would you feel comfortable posing the same request to someone else? If people would be upset with you if you said no, do you truly feel that they are coming from a respectful, reasonable place? (And, if not, might it be time to start setting some limits?) Is this a precedent you want to set? (And, if not, where would be a reasonable place to draw the line?) Think of someone you feel has very healthy boundaries—the kind you would like to emulate. How do you think they would respond in this situation? What is fair here? If you were in the position of the other person, would your solution still appear to be fair? Have you committed to this, or is this an expectation that the other person is placing on you? Is there another solution here that could be more win-win? Does the act of making a change or setting a boundary create more stress than it might alleviate in the long run? When you imagine the results a year from now, do you get a sense that this would be a better solution than what you have now? If you are setting a boundary and you feel the other person is unreasonable in fighting the boundary, and you are willing to let the relationship go rather than feel hurt by the boundary mismatch?",set boundaries always easy process let people know need limit often stressful especially use people use relationship boundaries certain point put fight try change boundaries people like children often try test boundaries among one another stressful especially take account toll conflict stress level however end result well worth relationships involve greater level mutual respect meet need party involve create much less stress everyone first step set boundaries gain understand personal boundaries lie comfortable people get close take certain liberties often first clue feel get boundaries violate different people different boundaries something bother others may bother vice versa therefore important communicate others comfort level discomfort level lie people different boundaries may able keep violate follow general guidelines help become aware personal boundaries additional question ask look specific choices make rather feel general help decide whether boundary need set follow question help clarify boundaries specific situations navigate future ones determine feel decide indeed wish set boundary perfect world aware personal comfort zone lie need simply communicate information others relationship boundary set however quite often real world boundary set involve negotiation always smoothly people boundaries may match may push greater distance closeness reason change boundaries status quo also cause people react try reinforce previous exist boundaries sometimes ways make uncomfortable way set boundaries struggle need think need well need reactions others important circumspect set boundaries question ask discover personal boundaries lie different question may ask decide actually set boundaries specific situations take account practical factor like cost set boundaries also allow clear issue guilt feel guilty motivation worth move forward least amount stress question ask important note likely weigh feel heavily feel others must live consequences decisions also one live consequences choices ultimately comfort level boundaries question provide food think decide set boundary work boundary set strategies assertive communication techniques bring nice result life feel resentful people ask much seem happen often find say yes things rather avoid upset disappoint others find feel resentful others tend keep people arm length afraid let people get close overwhelm find feel people may even appreciate much stress feel disappoint others greater stress things inconvenience drain effort please nobody would disappoint would prefer say yes look benefit cost situation tangible intangible worth effort say yes would feel comfortable pose request someone else people would upset say truly feel come respectful reasonable place might time start set limit precedent want set would reasonable place draw line think someone feel healthy boundaries kind would like emulate think would respond situation fair position person would solution still appear fair commit expectation person place another solution could win win act make change set boundary create stress might alleviate long run imagine result year get sense would better solution set boundary feel person unreasonable fight boundary will let relationship rather feel hurt boundary mismatch

Knowing youth suicide facts is especially important for parents of children with depression. For parents, suicidal thoughts and behaviors are one of the most alarming concerns of childhood depression. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), death by suicide is the second leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-olds, and many more children attempt but do not complete suicide.
 
Suicide rates in America are the highest they've been in 50 years. According to the CDC, suicide rates were significantly higher in 2017 compared to 1999 among females ages 10 to 14 (1.7 and 0.5, respectively) and 15 to 24 (5.8 and 3.0) and males ages 10 to 14 (3.3 and 1.9, respectively) and 15 to 24 (22.7 and 16.8). In 2017, adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 had a suicide rate of 14.46.
 
A 2018 study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found that the suicide rate among black children under 13 years is double the rate for white children in the same age group. This accounts for both girls and boys.
 Typically, rates of suicide increase with age, peaking in late adolescence. Girls more often attempt suicide, but boys more frequently follow through to completion. 
According to one study, suicidal thoughts are linked to a worse course of depression, the symptoms of which include earlier onset, longer duration, and shorter intervals of remission.
 
It's important to know that not all depressed children will have suicidal thoughts or show suicidal behavior. In fact, it's one of the least common symptoms of childhood depression. Also, not all children with suicidal thoughts and behavior are depressed.
 
Perhaps most comforting to know, not all children who have suicidal thoughts will attempt suicide. However, it's a good predictor for future attempts, and these children always need to be evaluated by a professional.
 
Some important warning signs of suicidal behavior in children are:
 
It's not always easy to detect the risk factors that may contribute to a child's risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. However, recognizing them and getting help can be life-saving. 
 
If you think that your child or someone you care about has some of these factors, consider setting up an appointment with a mental health professional for a suicide-risk assessment. If the adolescent is high-risk, you may need to schedule these assessments on a regular basis.
 
Here are some strategies to help your child if you think they are having suicidal thoughts:
 
It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your child's well-being. If you think that your child is in crisis and that they have had a previous suicide attempt, is threatening to harm themselves, or you just have a ""gut feeling,"" get your child help immediately.
 
Don't wait. If needed, take your child to a pediatric emergency room. Do not leave them alone. Remove anything in the house they can possibly use to hurt themselves.
 If your child is having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Having a child who is depressed or is suicidal does not make you a bad parent or mean that you did anything to cause their pain. The best thing you can do is to get your child help and support them in their recovery.
 Aggressive or hostile behavior Anxiety or restlessness A change in personality (from upbeat to quiet) Declining interest in friends, activities, or hobbies previously enjoyed Expressions of hopelessness about the future, like ""You won't have to worry about me anymore"" Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt, or self-hatred Frequent statements or social media posts about self-harm or suicide, like ""I wish I were dead"" Giving away things of importance Neglecting personal appearance or grooming Preoccupation with death in conversation, writing, or drawing Reckless or risk-taking behavior (such as substance use, reckless driving, and sexual promiscuity) Running away from home Sleep, appetite, or energy changes Withdrawal from friends and family A family history of suicide, depression, or other mental illness History of physical or emotional abuse Loss of a close family member, friend, or classmate by suicide or other sudden death Previous history of depression or other mental health illness Previous suicide attempts Threats, bullying, or violence from peers Be aware. While rare in young children, suicide is possible. Know the warning signs and risk factors that may increase your child's risk of suicide. Get your child treatment. If your child is depressed or at high risk for depression or another mental illness, it's essential to get them treatment. Keep weapons locked up. Common sense tells you to keep weapons, medications, alcohol, and poisons safely away from children, but this is especially important for children at risk of suicide. Talk to your child. Talking about suicide will not give your child the idea to attempt suicide. If a friend or other loved one has died, committed suicide, or is extremely ill, talk to your child about it and address their feelings. Tell others. If your child exhibits suicidal thoughts or behaviors, tell their other caretakers and faculty members at school so they can closely monitor your child when you're not around.",know youth suicide facts especially important parent children depression parent suicidal thoughts behaviors one alarm concern childhood depression accord center disease control cdc death suicide second lead cause death among year olds many children attempt complete suicide suicide rat america highest years accord cdc suicide rat significantly higher compare among females age respectively males age respectively adolescents young adults age suicide rate study publish journal jama pediatrics find suicide rate among black children years double rate white children age group account girls boys typically rat suicide increase age peak late adolescence girls often attempt suicide boys frequently follow completion accord one study suicidal thoughts link worse course depression symptoms include earlier onset longer duration shorter intervals remission important know depress children suicidal thoughts show suicidal behavior fact one least common symptoms childhood depression also children suicidal thoughts behavior depress perhaps comfort know children suicidal thoughts attempt suicide however good predictor future attempt children always need evaluate professional important warn sign suicidal behavior children always easy detect risk factor may contribute child risk suicidal thoughts behavior however recognize get help life save think child someone care factor consider set appointment mental health professional suicide risk assessment adolescent high risk may need schedule assessments regular basis strategies help child think suicidal thoughts better safe sorry come child well think child crisis previous suicide attempt threaten harm gut feel get child help immediately wait need take child pediatric emergency room leave alone remove anything house possibly use hurt child suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database child depress suicidal make bad parent mean anything cause pain best thing get child help support recovery aggressive hostile behavior anxiety restlessness change personality upbeat quiet decline interest friends activities hobbies previously enjoy expressions hopelessness future like worry anymore feel worthlessness shame guilt self hatred frequent statements social media post self harm suicide like wish dead give away things importance neglect personal appearance groom preoccupation death conversation write draw reckless risk take behavior substance use reckless drive sexual promiscuity run away home sleep appetite energy change withdrawal friends family family history suicide depression mental illness history physical emotional abuse loss close family member friend classmate suicide sudden death previous history depression mental health illness previous suicide attempt threats bully violence peer aware rare young children suicide possible know warn sign risk factor may increase child risk suicide get child treatment child depress high risk depression another mental illness essential get treatment keep weapons lock common sense tell keep weapons medications alcohol poison safely away children especially important children risk suicide talk child talk suicide give child idea attempt suicide friend love one die commit suicide extremely ill talk child address feel tell others child exhibit suicidal thoughts behaviors tell caretakers faculty members school closely monitor child around

Strictly speaking, suicidal ideation means wanting to take your own life or thinking about suicide. However, there are two kinds of suicidal ideation: passive and active. Passive suicidal ideation occurs when you wish you were dead or that you could die, but you don't actually have any plans to commit suicide.
 
Active suicidal ideation, on the other hand, is not only thinking about it but having the intent to commit suicide, including planning how to do it.
 Suicidal ideation is one of the symptoms of both major depression and the depression found in bipolar disorder, but it may also occur in people with other mental illnesses or no mental illness at all. 
The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation for the general world population is about 9% and about 2% within a 12-month period.﻿﻿
 
According to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 4.3% of U.S. adults ages 18 and older had thoughts about suicide, with the highest prevalence among adults ages 18 to 25.﻿﻿
 For people with mental health disorders, the rate is significantly higher. The exact numbers are unclear, but since suicidal ideation is a symptom of mental health disorders like major depression and bipolar disorder, the problem exists at a far greater percentage in these populations. 
Suicide is on the rise, with half of the states in the United States reporting more than a 30% increase since 1999 and nearly all the rest reporting increased rates since then, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).﻿﻿
 
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and the second leading cause of death among 10- to 34-year-olds. Women attempt suicide more often than men, but men are successful about three to four times more often than women.﻿﻿
 
Warning signs that you or a loved one are thinking about or contemplating suicide include:
 
If you think a loved one is thinking about or planning suicide, ask. It's a myth that you'll give another person the idea to kill him or herself. Asking shows that you're concerned and that you care about the person.
 
Be aware that passive suicidal ideation, wishing that you could die in your sleep or in an accident rather than by your own hand, is not necessarily any less serious than active suicidal ideation.﻿﻿ It can quickly turn active and it most certainly has a blend of active and passive components.
 If your loved one admits that they are thinking about suicide, make sure they are safe. 
Be there for them if and when they need you. If the situation is serious, you may need to involve your loved one's doctor or mental health professional or perhaps call a suicide hotline for advice or help. Keep checking on them until you feel certain that they're in a safe state of mind again.
 
Many different factors can contribute to suicidal ideation. Often these thoughts strike when you're feeling hopeless and out of control in your life and/or like it has no meaning or purpose.
 
These feelings may be due to circumstances like relationship problems, trauma, substance use, a crisis of some sort, pressure at work, a physical health issue, or financial difficulties. Having any mental health disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or anxiety can also contribute.﻿﻿
 
There are a variety of risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide, including
 
If you’re experiencing symptoms of depression and are having suicidal thoughts, your doctor will likely give you a medical exam and ask you to take a questionnaire that may include the following questions:
 
If you have suicidal thoughts but there is no crisis, your doctor or therapist may recommend psychotherapy, medications, and lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of suicide.
 If you start experiencing thoughts of suicide after taking an antidepressant, call your mental health care professional immediately. Antidepressants have been linked to an increase in suicidal thoughts. 
Here are some ways to help reduce suicidal thoughts and get the help you need to get back on track, whether you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal ideation:
 
Look for triggers or circumstances that lead to feelings of despair such as a death or a loss, alcohol use, or stress from relationships. Eliminate what you can and talk to someone, such as a counselor or close friend, about the others.
 
Feelings come and go and are not permanent. Even when life seems hopeless, you can get on the road to feeling better with treatment. You'll learn how to cope with life stresses, as well as to get a new perspective. Sometimes even just taking a nap or going to bed when you're feeling especially low can reset your mood, at least enough to stop the suicidal thoughts.
 
In addition to eating healthy meals regularly and never skipping meals, get plenty of rest and relaxation to stave off stress and help your body recuperate from days' past. Exercise is also important for relieving stress and improving your emotional well-being.
 
Make the time to be around people with positive influences on your life and those who make you feel good about yourself. Also, don't forget to give back to your community either through money or your time. Helping others and giving back can be a great way to get out of your own head and to find meaning.
 
Just as old habits have to die to let go of suicidal ideation, new ideas must take their place to stick. Develop your personal and professional interests. Find fun things to do, volunteer activities, or work that gives you a sense of purpose. When you’re doing things you find fulfilling, you’ll feel better about yourself and those feelings of despair are less likely to return.
 
Find personal ways to relieve stress levels. In addition to exercising, you can meditate, use sensory strategies to relax, practice simple breathing exercises, and challenge self-defeating thoughts to help you overcome suicidal thoughts.
 
Though it may be difficult, studies show that if you're able to talk to someone regularly, particularly in a face-to-face situation like to a close friend or counselor, you're less likely to attempt suicide.
 
You can also talk to your doctor or go directly to the emergency room if you are having suicidal thoughts. Doctors will evaluate your immediate risk and may recommend hospitalization if the risk is severe or refer you to a mental health professional for treatment.
 Isolating yourself from your loved ones Feeling hopeless or trapped Talking about death or suicide Giving away possessions An increase in substance use or misuse Increased mood swings, anger, rage, and/or irritability Engaging in risk-taking behavior like using drugs or having unprotected sex Accessing the means to kill yourself, such as medication, drugs, or a firearm Acting as if you're saying goodbye to people Feeling extremely anxious Having attempted suicide in the past Having a mental health disorder Feeling hopeless, isolated, and/or lonely Not being married Being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender Having served in the military Having a chronic physical illness like cancer, diabetes, or a terminal disease Having chronic pain Having a traumatic brain injury Having a family history of suicide Having a drug or alcohol use disorder Having experienced childhood abuse or trauma Living in a rural area Having access to firearms Do you have a history of depression or mental illness?

One of the most frightening experiences a person can have is hearing a friend or loved one say they want to die. While it can be tempting to cope with this information by labeling it as attention-seeking behavior or clinging to the myth that people who talk about suicide don't actually follow through (which is simply untrue), it's important to take all warning signs of suicide and suicidal ideation seriously.
 
If your friend is at risk of attempting suicide right now, call your local police department or 911 right away. Imminent danger includes a person in possession of a weapon, pills, or other means to follow through with suicide. If possible, don't leave them alone and do your best to remove any possible means they can use to hurt themselves.
 
If it is safe, you may also drive your friend to the emergency room. Doctors will assess their mental and physical health and create a clear plan that will help keep them safe. 
 
If, on the other hand, you believe the threat is serious, but not imminent, it's still important to act, but you may take the time to show support, listen, and encourage them to seek professional help. Help is available. Here are some helpful tips from various suicide prevention resources.
 
There are a number of different things you can do to be a supportive and empathetic friend. The key is to avoid being judgmental or dismissive of what your friend is feeling.
 
There are no right or wrong things you can say if you are speaking out of love and concern. Just be yourself. Show that you care by talking to them, holding them while they cry, or whatever else is necessary. Research has shown that acknowledging what people are experiencing may help them process their thoughts﻿﻿ and may reduce their suicidal thoughts.﻿﻿
 
A suicidal person usually is carrying around some burden that they feel they just can't handle anymore. Offer to listen as they vent their feelings of despair, anger, and loneliness.﻿﻿ Sometimes this is enough to lighten the load just enough for them to carry on.
 
Be sympathetic, non-judgmental, patient, calm, and accepting. The person will pick up on your attitude and begin to mirror it for themselves.
 
Don't be afraid to ask, ""Are you having thoughts of suicide?"" Studies show that asking at-risk friends and family members if they are thinking about suicide does not increase suicidal thoughts.﻿﻿ You are not putting ideas in their head by asking. On the contrary, asking will give you valuable information about how to proceed and help.
 If the answer is yes, follow up with these three questions: 
Fortunately, the majority of people will either say that they have no definite plans or that they don't have the nerve to do it themselves. Although this is still a serious situation, you know that they are probably not in imminent danger of hurting themselves. Take their words as a plea for help and proceed with helping them to get the assistance that they need.﻿﻿ Urge them to seek professional help as soon as possible.
 
If the answers they give you lead you to believe they are in immediate danger, do not hesitate to contact the authorities. Your friend may tell you that you are betraying them or making them angry. You may feel like you will lose their friendship if you take action. Just remember that you may permanently lose their friendship if you don't. When they're well again, they will thank you.
 
Talking will allow them to reduce the emotional burden they are carrying and give them time to calm down.﻿﻿ The longer you keep them talking, the more you can take the edge off their desperation. As their momentum winds down, it's harder for them to act on their feelings.
 
Try not to offer quick solutions or belittle the person's feelings. How big they perceive the problem to be and how much they are hurting over it is what counts. Rational arguments do little good to persuade a person when they are in this state of mind. Instead, offer your empathy and compassion for what they are feeling without making any judgments about whether they should feel that way.
 
If the person has already started a suicide attempt, call for help immediately. If they are still conscious, get what information you can about what substances they have ingested, how long ago they took them, how much they took, when they last ate, and their general state of health.
 
If you are in a situation, such as an online friendship, where you know very little about the person, encourage them to call 911 on their own or to call a suicide hotline in their area. This is your best option, because a local agency, such as 911 or a hotline, may be able to trace the call and get assistance to them. If they refuse to call, do your best to learn whatever personal information you can about the person. Don't hesitate to ask them for their address, phone number, and other information to help dispatch an emergency crew to their home. 
 
Dealing with a suicide threat is very stressful. Be sure to care for yourself as well and seek assistance to process and decompress afterward. Talk to a trusted friend, a therapist, your doctor, a religious leader, or anyone who can offer support about what you've been through and how you feel about it.
 
Supporting a friend or loved one experiencing suicidal thoughts can be scary and taxing. Do your best to provide support and get help. If, in spite of your attempts to help, your loved one still attempts or completes suicide, do not blame yourself. Remind yourself that you did the best you could with the information you had and seek help for yourself such as grief counseling or joining suicide survivor support groups.

Drinking alcohol has been linked to a number of suicides and suicidal attempts. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, a diagnosis of alcohol misuse or dependence is associated with a suicide risk that is 10 times greater than those in the general population.﻿﻿
 
Of those medically treated after a suicide attempt, alcohol use disorders were found to be a significant factor, with acute alcohol intoxication present in about 30% to 40% of cases.﻿﻿
 Now there is evidence that suicide risk among alcoholics increases as they become older as well. People with alcohol use disorder who are middle-aged and older are at a significantly higher risk for suicide compared to their younger counterparts. 
This could prove to be a significant factor for baby boomers, many of whom have substance use problems, as they begin to reach retirement age.
 
The statistics are the result of a study published in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.﻿﻿ Lead author Kenneth R. Conner, assistant professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center, notes that ""This was the first study of a sample of adults across the age spectrum that explicitly focused on factors that increase the risk for suicide and medically serious suicide attempts associated with ​alcohol dependence.""
 
For the purposes of the study, a medically serious suicide attempt was defined as one that required hospital admission for up to 24 hours. It also needed to meet one other criterion that described the type of treatment received.
 
""Data were gathered from medically serious attempters because they are a subgroup of suicide attempters who engaged in the especially dangerous behavior, suggesting a high intent to die,"" said Conner. Even if not successful the first time, he notes that the risk of dying in subsequent attempts is higher.
 
In general, adolescents and young adults are at the highest risk for attempted suicides throughout the world. Yet, most of these attempts do not result in death. In contrast, though the attempts may be less frequent, men over age 65 are at the greatest risk for completed suicide.
 
To researchers, this reinforced the idea that there are different patterns related to age and suicide. This finding was backed up by a later 2017 study that found an increase in suicide attempts in older people who did and did not have substance use problems.﻿﻿ Among the concerns is the fact that the compounding life experiences of older alcoholics are not the same as their younger counterparts.
 Placing all ages into one group is not an accurate way to gauge the suicide risks of either alcoholics or non-alcoholics. 
The Rochester researchers examined data gathered by Annette L. Beautrais and colleagues for the Canterbury Suicide Project. This is a case-control study of suicides, medically serious suicide attempts, and randomly selected comparison subjects from the Canterbury region of New Zealand.
 
All subjects in the study were 18 years of age or older: 193 (149 males, 44 females) had died by committing suicide; 240 (114 males, 126 females) had made a medically serious suicide attempt; and 984 (476 males, 508 females) were controls. Researchers compared demographic and diagnostic variables.
 
The results found that there is indeed a link between alcohol dependence and suicide becomes amplified with age.﻿﻿ Increased age also amplified the association between mood disorders and suicide. Overall, researchers in this field continue to look at the associations between age, alcohol use disorder, and suicide.
 In addition to these factors, many experts note that mood disorders like depression must also be accounted for as they can also make older adults more vulnerable. 
It is believed that older adults with alcohol use disorder are at a higher risk of suicide because of the emotional and physical tolls their addictions take over the years. The results of these studies serve as a warning that anyone dealing with alcoholism—their own or that of a loved one—should be aware of the warning signs of suicidal ideation and be prepared to get help.

It's difficult to imagine what led a friend, family member, or celebrity to commit suicide. There may have been no clear warning signs, and you may wonder what clues you might have missed. Often, many factors combine to lead a person to the decision to take their own life.
 
Most people make the decision to attempt suicide shortly before doing so impulsively rather than planning it out extensively.
 
While there are many factors that can influence a person's decision to commit suicide, the most common one is severe depression.﻿﻿ Depression can make people feel great emotional pain and loss of hope, making them unable to see another way to relieve the pain other than ending their own life.
 According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, depression is present in about half of all suicides. 
Other mental illnesses that can increase the risk of suicide include: 
 
A person who has had a traumatic experience, including childhood sexual abuse, rape, physical abuse, or war trauma, is at a greater risk for suicide, even many years after the trauma.﻿﻿
 In a survey of nearly 6,000 U.S. adults, nearly 22% of people who have been raped had attempted suicide at some point while 23% who experienced physical assault tried to take their own life at some point. 
Being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or multiple incidents of trauma raises the risk even further. This is partly because depression is common after trauma and among those with PTSD, causing feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that can lead to suicide.
 
Drugs and alcohol can also influence a person who is feeling suicidal, making them more impulsive and likely to act upon their urges than they would be while sober. Substance and alcohol use can contribute to other reasons people commit suicide, such as the loss of jobs and relationships.﻿﻿
 
The rates of substance use and alcohol use disorder are also higher among people with depression and other psychological disorders. Put these together and the risks increase.
 
A person may decide to take their own life when facing a loss or the fear of a loss. These situations can include:
 
Hopelessness, either in the short-term or as a longer-lasting trait, has been found in many studies to contribute to the decision to commit suicide. The person may be facing a social or physical challenge and may see no way the situation can improve.
 When people feel they have lost all hope and don't feel able to change that, it can overshadow all of the good things in their life, making suicide seem like a viable option.  
While it might seem obvious to an outside observer that things will get better, people with depression may not be able to see this due to the pessimism and despair that go along with this illness.
 
If a person has chronic pain or illness with no hope of a cure or reprieve from suffering, suicide may seem like a way to regain dignity and control of their life. In some states, assisted suicide is legal for this very reason.
 
According to a study in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine, the following health conditions were associated with a higher risk of suicide:﻿﻿
 
Chronic pain can also bring on anxiety and depression, which can also increase your risk of suicide. According to research, people with chronic pain are four times more likely to have depression or anxiety than those who are pain-free.﻿﻿
 
A person with chronic pain or a terminal illness can also feel like a burden to others, as it becomes harder and harder to ask for yet another ride to the doctor's office or more help with household duties or assistance paying for hospital bills. In fact, many people who decide to commit suicide often state that their loved ones or the world, in general, would be better off without them.
 
This type of rhetoric is a common warning sign of suicide. People often see themselves as a burden to others or feel worthless due to the overwhelming emotional burden they are carrying within.
 
A person can become socially isolated for many reasons, including losing friends or a spouse, undergoing a separation or divorce, physical or mental illness, social anxiety, retirement, or due to a move to a new location. Social isolation can also be caused by internal factors such as low self-esteem. This can lead to loneliness and other risk factors of suicide such as depression and alcohol or drug misuse.
 
Sometimes people attempt suicide not so much because they really want to die, but because they simply don't know how to get help. Suicide attempts are not a cry for attention but a cry for help. It becomes a way to demonstrate to the world just how much they are hurting.
 
Unfortunately, these cries for help may sometimes prove to be fatal if the person misjudges the lethality of their chosen method. People who make a failed attempt are also at a much higher risk of trying again, and their second attempts are much more likely to be lethal.

Some situations that appear to be suicide may actually be an accidental death. The choking game (also known as “pass-out challenge,” “flatliner,” and ""space monkey”) where teens strangle themselves to achieve a high-like sensation and autoerotic asphyxiation are examples of suffocation suicides. Other accidental suicides include unintentional overdoses and firearm and poisoning suicides.
 
You may never know why a person committed suicide. While it might have appeared that someone had everything to live for, it probably didn't feel that way to them.

Suicides in the United States have been on the rise, up 33% from 1999 through 2017, and the pace of the increase has been rising since 2006.﻿﻿ In 2016, suicide ranked as the 10th leading cause of death among Americans. It is the second leading cause of death for those under the age of 35.﻿﻿
 
The annual suicide rate in the U.S. is over 14 deaths per 100,000 population.﻿﻿
 Nearly 47,000 people died from suicide in 2017. According to the CDC, one person dies from suicide every 11 minutes. 
The suicide rate is the number of completed suicides per 100,000 people. Attempted suicide is not counted in the suicide rate. In addition to completed suicides, the CDC reports that in 2017, 10.6 million adults in the United States seriously thought about suicide, 3.2 million people made a plan, and 1.4 million attempted suicide.﻿﻿
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gather data from hospitals on cases of self-harm and suicide each year. However, some consider the numbers to be low because the stigma still surrounding suicide can result in underreporting.
 
When the suicide rate is broken down by demographics, important information can be observed. For example:﻿﻿
 
Suicide statistics by age group have been consistent for several years. Broken down by age group across all racial and ethnic groups, suicide as a leading cause of death ranked as follows:
 
Suicide is expensive—costly not only in the emotional toll it takes but also for its real financial impact. The estimated loss is over $58 billion in medical costs and lost work.﻿﻿
 
The World Health Organization reports that nearly 800,000 people die worldwide each year from suicide, which is about one person every 40 seconds.﻿﻿ Globally, it is the second leading cause of death for those between the ages of 15 and 24.
 
A 2019 report published in The BMJ found that the global suicide rate has dropped by almost a third since 1990.﻿﻿ The study found that while the actual number of suicides increased during this time, the suicide rate dropped from 16.6 deaths per 100,000 in 1990 to 11.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2016.
 
These global declines in suicide deaths are largely attributed to drops in the suicide rates in China and India. Other countries including the United States, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, and Belize all experienced significant increases in suicides over the same time period.﻿﻿
 
Depression and suicide are linked, with an estimate that up to 60% of people who commit suicide have major depression.﻿﻿ But it's important to note that this figure doesn't mean most people with depression will attempt suicide.
 
Research suggests that the majority of suicides are related to a psychiatric condition, including depression, substance use disorders, and psychosis.﻿﻿ Estimates suggest that the suicide risk for mental disorders including depression, alcoholism, and schizophrenia is around 5% to 8%.
 However, while many people who commit suicide had symptoms of a mental condition, it is important to note that most people with symptoms of mental disorders do not commit suicide. 
There are warning signs you can watch for in those who may be at risk of attempting suicide.﻿﻿ Though there is no single type of person who may commit suicide and the symptoms below are not exhaustive, these are the most common signs observed among people who may be contemplating taking their own life.
 
If you or someone you know is depressed, there are effective treatments available.
 The suicide rate is four times higher for males than females. In the United States, male deaths make up almost 80% of all suicide deaths. Suicide is attempted three times as often by females; women are also more likely to have suicidal thoughts. Firearms are the most common cause of death for males. Poisoning is the most common cause of death for females. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual kids are three times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual kids. 41% of trans adults attempt suicide. The suicide rate is 1.8 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas.﻿﻿  The suicide rate is highest among middle-aged white males. A 2015 study in the Proceedings of the Natural Sciences found that the suicide rate among white, middle-aged American men has increased dramatically in recent years.﻿﻿ Among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, suicide is the eighth leading cause of death across all ages. For the age group 15 to 34 of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, suicide jumps to the second leading cause of death. A change in personality, especially behaviors in social situations Withdrawal from interaction or communication with others Mood changes that are drastic, such as being very low mood one day to being in a very high mood the next Triggers such as life crisis or trauma in a person who is already living with depression Threats of suicide, or expressed negative wishes regarding life, such as wishing they'd ""never been born"" Giving away cherished belongings to friends and loved ones Deep depression observed that affects their ability to function socially or in the workplace Aggressive or risky behaviors, such as high-speed driving Talking to your doctor is a good first step.

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in older children and teens.
 
In 2017, there were more than 6,200 suicides among teens and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24, which makes it the second leading cause of death for people in this age group—just after unintentional motor vehicle accidents.﻿﻿
 
While pre-teen suicide risk tends to be lower, data from the CDC shows that 183 children between the ages of 9 and 12 died by suicide in 2018.﻿﻿
 
Unfortunately, statistics show that suicide rates in teenagers are on the rise.
 
After a trend of decreasing suicide rates from 1996 to 2007, teen suicide rates have been slowing increasing again. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found a 47% increase in suicides between the years 2000 and 2017 among people between the ages of 15 and 24.﻿﻿
 
Why?
 
Experts aren't sure yet, but theories include:
 
Another leading theory is that the rise in teen suicides may be because fewer teens are being treated with antidepressants when they have depression. This follows the 2003 FDA warning about antidepressants and suicide. However, since untreated depression is itself a risk factor for suicide, fewer teens taking antidepressants could have the unintended effect of leading to more suicides.
 
Worldwide, about 90,000 teens commit suicide each year, with about four million suicide attempts. That means that one teenager dies from suicide about every five minutes. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among people between the ages of 15 and 29.﻿﻿
 
In addition to untreated depression, other suicide risk factors include:
 LGBTQ youth (and transgender youth in particular) have an elevated risk. The Trevor Project reports that LGB youth are five times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth.﻿﻿ Research also shows that 44% of transgender youth had considered suicide in the previous year and 35% had attempted suicide.﻿﻿ 
According to the American Association of Suicidology, the warning signs of suicide can include:
 
If you think that your teen has any of the warning signs for suicide, don't ignore them. Trust your instincts and either try to get more information or seek additional help.
 
In addition to all of the teens who successfully commit suicide, there are many more who attempt suicide.
 Experts estimate that 20 to 25% of teens admit to thinking about suicide at some time in their lives and for every suicide, there are between 5 to 45 suicide attempts. 
That makes it even more important for parents, pediatricians, and everyone else that is regularly around teenagers to understand how to try and prevent suicides, such as:
 
You should also make sure that your kids know that they can ask for help if they ever think about hurting themselves, including calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, calling their doctor, calling 911, or going to a local crisis center or the emergency room.

In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the numbers of men who elect to end their own lives prematurely through suicide. While women tend to experience more suicidal thinking, men are far more likely to die by suicide.
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 47,000 people died by suicide in 2017 in the United States.﻿﻿ Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death overall. In 2015, suicide was the seventh leading cause of death for all American men, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Suicide is a serious problem in the United States and worldwide, but there is hope. 
 
Here are some important things to understand about suicide among men and what you can do if you or a loved one are having hopeless feelings or having thoughts about suicide.
 
Not every attempt at suicide results in completion, although unsuccessful first attempts are often followed by successful second attempts.
 
The most common risk factors for suicide are:
 
In older men, suicide is most strongly associated with depression, physical pain and illness, living alone, and feelings of hopelessness and guilt.
 
In addition to the above risk factors, there are some other theories as to why men are at a greater risk of suicide.
 
Men are also more likely to use lethal suicide methods.
 
There are strategies that both individuals and communities can utilize to help reduce the risk of male suicide. 
 
Emotional and practical support is important for helping people to adjust their circumstances in order to restore well-being. The warning signs listed above do not inevitably lead to suicide attempts.
 
However, people who feel suicidal often report a certain kind of tunnel vision, of being unable to see the broader picture and thinking only in terms of black and white. In such circumstances, that individual may not be motivated to seek out help for themselves, and it often falls on others to offer support by listening, offering encouragement, and sometimes even challenging the preconceptions that people hold about themselves such as their abilities and worth to society.
 
Other ways to help reduce male suicide:
 A 2019 study published in the Journal of Mental Health found that receiving support from a trusted and respected friend can be an effective suicide prevention strategy for men. Forming connections with other people who are going through the same thing can also be helpful.  
Reframing help-seeking is also important. Men may avoid asking for help because they fear it is a sign of weakness. Finding ways to change this perspective is a critical aspect of reducing male suicide rates. The 2019 study also found that reframing help-seeking as masculine behavior increases the likelihood that men will ask for help when they need it.﻿﻿
 
Getting help for people expressing suicidal intent or showing the warning signs is incredibly important. Help is available from a number of different sources, including family doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, voluntary organizations, community mental health centers, local hospitals, or social agencies.
 
There are effective treatments for depression. Psychotherapy, antidepressants, and often a combination of both can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and lowering the risk of suicide.
 
Symptoms of depression may manifest differently in men than in women, which may explain why signs are often missed by loved ones and physicians. Cultural expectations can also play a role in why men fail to seek help when they are feeling hopeless or suicidal. Fortunately, there are treatments available that can help men learn to cope, feel better, and get back to their usual selves.
 In 2017, the suicide rate for men was 3.5 times higher than it was for women. The suicide rate is highest among middle-aged white men, who accounted for almost 70% of all suicides in 2017. Research also suggests that while women attempt suicide more often, men choose more lethal means of suicide. The World Health Organization reports that suicide represents half of all male violent deaths worldwide. Men over the age of 65 are at the greatest risk of suicide. Using drugs and/or alcohol to help cope with emotions, relationships, the pressure of work, or other issues Social isolation or living alone Not being able to form or sustain meaningful relationships Divorce or relationship breakdowns A history of physical and sexual abuse Imprisonment Being bullied at school, college, or work Unemployment Loss of a loved one through trauma or disease Mental illness, particularly where this is related to depression and painful or debilitating illnesses or conditions Traditional male gender roles discourage emotional expression. Men are told they need to be tough and that they should not need to ask for help. Such rigid gender norms may make it difficult for men to reach out and ask for support when they need it. Depression may be underdiagnosed in men. Men often do not disclose feelings of depression to their doctors. When they do, it is often described in terms of having problems at work or in relationships. Men also tend to describe their feelings as ""stress"" rather than sadness or hopelessness. Men are less likely to seek help for emotional problems. Researchers suggest that depression is diagnosed less frequently in men because of the tendency to deny illness, self-monitor symptoms, and self-treat.﻿﻿ Men may be more likely to self-treat symptoms of depression with alcohol and other substances. Watch for signs of depression. Symptoms of depression in men include irritability, social withdrawal, anxiety, loss of interest or pleasure, physical pains and complaints, engaging in risky behaviors, misusing drugs and alcohol, and being unable to keep up with normal daily tasks. Offer support. If you notice signs of depression, ask what you can do to help, and let him know that you are there to listen and help. Don't ignore the signs. Avoid dismissing or making light of comments that indicate suicidal thoughts or behaviors. If you hear suicidal talk or statements, encourage him to talk to his doctor or therapist. Identify men who are at risk and offer support. Teach men coping and problem-solving skills to help them manage challenges with work, relationships, and health issues. Make mental health support options readily available. Create opportunities that bring groups of people together so that they can form social connections and find support. Restrict access to lethal means of suicide, such as firearms and prescription drugs.",information present article may trigger people suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database recent years steady increase number men elect end live prematurely suicide women tend experience suicidal think men far likely die suicide center disease control prevention report people die suicide unite state suicide tenth lead cause death overall suicide seventh lead cause death american men accord national center injury prevention control suicide serious problem unite state worldwide hope important things understand suicide among men love one hopeless feel thoughts suicide every attempt suicide result completion although unsuccessful first attempt often follow successful second attempt common risk factor suicide older men suicide strongly associate depression physical pain illness live alone feel hopelessness guilt addition risk factor theories men greater risk suicide men also likely use lethal suicide methods strategies individuals communities utilize help reduce risk male suicide emotional practical support important help people adjust circumstances order restore well warn sign list inevitably lead suicide attempt however people feel suicidal often report certain kind tunnel vision unable see broader picture think term black white circumstances individual may motivate seek help often fall others offer support listen offer encouragement sometimes even challenge preconceptions people hold abilities worth society ways help reduce male suicide study publish journal mental health find receive support trust respect friend effective suicide prevention strategy men form connections people thing also helpful reframing help seek also important men may avoid ask help fear sign weakness find ways change perspective critical aspect reduce male suicide rat study also find reframing help seek masculine behavior increase likelihood men ask help need get help people express suicidal intent show warn sign incredibly important help available number different source include family doctor psychologists psychiatrists psychotherapists voluntary organizations community mental health center local hospitals social agencies effective treatments depression psychotherapy antidepressants often combination effective reduce symptoms depression lower risk suicide symptoms depression may manifest differently men women may explain sign often miss love ones physicians cultural expectations also play role men fail seek help feel hopeless suicidal fortunately treatments available help men learn cope feel better get back usual selves suicide rate men time higher women suicide rate highest among middle age white men account almost suicides research also suggest women attempt suicide often men choose lethal mean suicide world health organization report suicide represent half male violent deaths worldwide men age greatest risk suicide use drug alcohol help cope emotions relationships pressure work issue social isolation live alone able form sustain meaningful relationships divorce relationship breakdowns history physical sexual abuse imprisonment bully school college work unemployment loss love one trauma disease mental illness particularly relate depression painful debilitate illnesses condition traditional male gender roles discourage emotional expression men tell need tough need ask help rigid gender norms may make difficult men reach ask support need depression may underdiagnosed men men often disclose feel depression doctor often describe term problems work relationships men also tend describe feel stress rather sadness hopelessness men less likely seek help emotional problems researchers suggest depression diagnose less frequently men tendency deny illness self monitor symptoms self treat men may likely self treat symptoms depression alcohol substances watch sign depression symptoms depression men include irritability social withdrawal anxiety loss interest pleasure physical pain complaints engage risky behaviors misuse drug alcohol unable keep normal daily task offer support notice sign depression ask help let know listen help ignore sign avoid dismiss make light comment indicate suicidal thoughts behaviors hear suicidal talk statements encourage talk doctor therapist identify men risk offer support teach men cop problem solve skills help manage challenge work relationships health issue make mental health support options readily available create opportunities bring group people together form social connections find support restrict access lethal mean suicide firearms prescription drug

Suicidal ideation, sometimes referred to as suicidal thoughts, describes thoughts, fantasies, ideas or images related to committing suicide. Contrary to common belief, depression and suicidal thoughts are not limited to adults, but symptoms and warning signs are often different in teens. As a parent, caregiver or friend, the most important thing you can do to support a loved one who is struggling is to learn to recognize what suicidal ideation is, what it looks like in teens, and how to intervene.
 
For teens, thoughts of suicide can range from fleeting to making actual plans to end their life. For this reason, mental health professionals discuss suicidal ideation in terms of being either passive or active.
 
Passive suicidal ideation about suicide includes experiencing vague ideas about committing suicide. Suicide is viewed as a possible way to end the pain, but usually, no action is taken.
 
Active suicidal ideation is when a teen experiences persistent thoughts of suicide and continues to feel hopeless. When the ideation is active, a teen begins to take steps to carry out a suicide attempt.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death for children, teens, and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24.  
Suicidal ideation in teens is often caused by untreated depression or drug misuse and always needs to be taken seriously.
 
Suicidal thoughts and depression often have many causes. Social difficulties, stress, academic pressures, and other concerns facing teens may contribute to suicidal ideation.
 
Other risk factors include:
 
Genetic factors can play a role in depression and suicide risk as well. Teen that experience suicidal thoughts are often more likely to have family members who have died by suicide.﻿﻿
 
There are quite a few signs that your teenager may be experiencing suicidal ideation. Be on the lookout for:
 
Remember, warning signs can be different for every individual, and some teens keep these thoughts and feelings to themselves. If you feel like your teenager is showing any of these signs or are not acting like themselves, be sure to consult your physician as soon as possible.
 Early intervention is important with any mental illness, and if suicide is something your teen is considering, it's an emergency situation.  
Ivana, age 15, feels very sad when her best friend moves away and she experiences a deep sense of loneliness and insecurity. One night she finds herself thinking about suicide as a way to end the painful feelings she is having. She pictures herself taking a bottle of pills and drifting into a deep sleep she will not wake up from. When she wakes up the next day her suicidal ideation has changed, she knows it’s an option but is feeling better and decides to call a friend she hasn’t spoken to in a while.
 
If a teen is experiencing suicidal thoughts, there are steps that parents, friends and guardians can take.
 
For parents:
 
If your teen has symptoms of depression, anxiety or another psychiatric condition, talk to your child's pediatrician. While most people with mental health conditions do not attempt suicide, having an undiagnosed or untreated condition along with other risk factors can make suicide more likely.
 
Don't dismiss suicidal talk as ""typical teen drama."" If a child is making comments such as ""I might as well kill myself"" or ""I wish I was dead,"" you need to listen and acknowledge their pain. Let them know that you understand that they are hurting, you are there to offer support and you will help them get the help that they need.
 
If you are a parent or guardian, talk to your child's pediatrician and get a referral to a professional mental health provider. Your child's doctor or therapist may recommend psychotherapy, medications and lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of suicide.
 
If you are a teen and you are concerned that your friend is thinking about suicide:
 Poor social relationships Lack of family support Physical or sexual abuse Substance and alcohol misuse Health issues Bullying Isolation and withdrawing from social contact, especially if it's sudden Being self-destructive or engaging in risk-taking behaviors Looking for and/or acquiring means to commit suicide, such as getting a gun or a lot of medication Extreme mood swings Frequently talking about death or dying Saying things like, ""I wish I were dead"" or ""I wish I had never been born"" Giving away possessions for no particular reason Expressing hopelessness or a feeling of being trapped with no way out Changes in sleeping, eating or other patterns Making a point to say goodbye to people Beginning to use alcohol and/or drugs, or using them more frequently Changing obvious characteristics of their personality Becoming extremely agitated, upset, depressed and/or anxious Keep guns and prescription drugs away from children and teens. Watch for signs of substance use and get help immediately if you suspect there is a problem. Talk openly with your teen and let them know that you recognize their pain. Be supportive, understanding and nonjudgmental. Know the warning signs of suicide and depression. Take signs of suicide seriously. Encourage your friend to talk to their doctor or a trusted adult. Talk to a teacher, parent or another adult about your friend and your concerns.",information present article may trigger people suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database suicidal ideation sometimes refer suicidal thoughts describe thoughts fantasy ideas image relate commit suicide contrary common belief depression suicidal thoughts limit adults symptoms warn sign often different teens parent caregiver friend important thing support love one struggle learn recognize suicidal ideation look like teens intervene teens thoughts suicide range fleet make actual plan end life reason mental health professionals discuss suicidal ideation term either passive active passive suicidal ideation suicide include experience vague ideas commit suicide suicide view possible way end pain usually action take active suicidal ideation teen experience persistent thoughts suicide continue feel hopeless ideation active teen begin take step carry suicide attempt accord center disease control prevention suicide second lead cause death children teens young adults age suicidal ideation teens often cause untreated depression drug misuse always need take seriously suicidal thoughts depression often many cause social difficulties stress academic pressure concern face teens may contribute suicidal ideation risk factor include genetic factor play role depression suicide risk well teen experience suicidal thoughts often likely family members die suicide quite sign teenager may experience suicidal ideation lookout remember warn sign different every individual teens keep thoughts feel feel like teenager show sign act like sure consult physician soon possible early intervention important mental illness suicide something teen consider emergency situation ivana age feel sad best friend move away experience deep sense loneliness insecurity one night find think suicide way end painful feel picture take bottle pills drift deep sleep wake wake next day suicidal ideation change know option feel better decide call friend speak teen experience suicidal thoughts step parent friends guardians take parent teen symptoms depression anxiety another psychiatric condition talk child pediatrician people mental health condition attempt suicide undiagnosed untreated condition along risk factor make suicide likely dismiss suicidal talk typical teen drama child make comment might well kill wish dead need listen acknowledge pain let know understand hurt offer support help get help need parent guardian talk child pediatrician get referral professional mental health provider child doctor therapist may recommend psychotherapy medications lifestyle change help reduce risk suicide teen concern friend think suicide poor social relationships lack family support physical sexual abuse substance alcohol misuse health issue bully isolation withdraw social contact especially sudden self destructive engage risk take behaviors look acquire mean commit suicide get gun lot medication extreme mood swing frequently talk death die say things like wish dead wish never bear give away possessions particular reason express hopelessness feel trap way change sleep eat pattern make point say goodbye people begin use alcohol drug use frequently change obvious characteristics personality become extremely agitate upset depress anxious keep gun prescription drug away children teens watch sign substance use get help immediately suspect problem talk openly teen let know recognize pain supportive understand nonjudgmental know warn sign suicide depression take sign suicide seriously encourage friend talk doctor trust adult talk teacher parent another adult friend concern

A suicide safety plan is a written set of instructions that you create for yourself as a contingency plan should you begin to experience thoughts about harming yourself. It will contain a series of gradually escalating steps that you will follow, proceeding from one step to the next, until you are safe.
 
If you have depression, whether it has been diagnosed by a healthcare provider or not, there is a very real risk that at some point in the course of the illness you may experience thoughts of suicide. While the emotional pain that has triggered these thoughts may feel overwhelming, it does not mean that you will lose control or act on your thoughts.
 
In fact, having a suicide safety plan in place is one method you can use to cope with your bad feelings until circumstances change.
 
You should work together with someone you trust—such as your best friend, a close family member, or your doctor or therapist—to develop your suicide safety plan. It is best to get these people involved since you will most likely need to call on them if you decide to execute your plan.
 
Try to create the plan while you are feeling well and can think clearly, rather than waiting until you are actively suicidal. Put your suicide safety plan in writing and keep it in a place where you can easily find it should the need arise.
 
Your suicide safety plan should include several steps and be written in the order presented below. An example of each step is provided to help you think about what that step means for you.
 
The first step in creating your suicide safety plan is to familiarize yourself with the types of situations, images, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that might precede or accompany suicidal urges for you.
 
List these warning signs so that you can refer back to them when deciding whether to activate your plan. It's also helpful to familiarize yourself with some of the risk factors for suicide in order to recognize these warning signs if present.
 A warning sign could be that you tend to isolate yourself and not take good care of your health when you get depressed. 
Create a list of activities that can be soothing to you when you're upset. If you can't think of any examples off-hand, you may wish to brainstorm and try some mind-body methods that have helped others such as breathing exercises or body scan meditation. Or take a look at ​different ways to reduce stress to see if any methods might be helpful for you.
 A few self-soothing ideas to consider: taking a hot bath, listening to music, or exercising. 
Create a list of your reasons for living. When you are feeling suicidal, it is very easy to get caught up in the pain you are feeling and forget the positives in your life. Your list will help you refocus your attention on the reasons to keep going until your suicidal thoughts and feelings pass.
 
Some people with or without depression find that keeping a gratitude journal is helpful. If you find yourself feeling suicidal, looking at what you have written may help you focus on the positives in your life until the feelings pass.
 Consider writing about blessings like your family, friends, dog, health, or faith. 
Keep a list of contacts you can talk to if you are unable to distract yourself with self-help measures. List names, phone numbers, or other contact information, and be sure to have backups in case your first or second choices are unavailable.
 Your list of trusted contacts may include your significant other, friends, relatives, or your religious leader. 
Create a list of all professional resources available to you, along with their phone numbers, email addresses, and other pertinent contact information. This is also a good place to keep a number for a crisis hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255).
 Members of your professional health care team can include your psychiatrist and your therapist as well as a crisis hotline. 
If you haven't yet seen a mental health professional, take a moment to learn about the different types of therapists who care for people with depression, and make an appointment today.
 
Get our printable guide to help you ask the right questions at your next doctor's appointment. 
Plan what steps you can take to make yourself safe. This may involve removing or securing any items that you are likely to use to hurt yourself, or going to another location until the urges have passed. It may also involve getting another person involved to help you.
 If you feel like hurting yourself, you might plan to go to a public place like a mall, restaurant, or library to distract yourself. Or if you are feeling suicidal, you might ask someone to keep your gun at their house. 
If all other steps have failed to keep you feeling safe, go to your nearest hospital emergency room and ask for assistance.
 Keep the name, address, and directions to the hospital listed in your plan for easy access or save it in your GPS. 
If you do not feel that you can get to the hospital safely on your own, call 911 or the emergency contact number appropriate for where you live and ask for transport to the hospital.
 
Many people with depression have friends who are coping with similar challenges. This could be a friend you have met in a depression support group, or simply a friend or family member you have known for a long time. After all, depression is common.
 
After you have completed your own safety plan, encourage others who are coping with depression to create a plan for themselves.
 
If you begin to experience any of the warning signs of suicide listed in your suicide safety plan, proceed through the steps you have previously outlined for yourself, one by one, until you are feeling safe again. An exception would be if you are feeling out of control and are strongly thinking of suicide. In that case, it is best to call either a trusted friend who can be with you immediately or 911.
 
While you will likely have your suicide safety plan in your home, there are now smartphone safety plan apps that you can take with you anywhere. These apps may be of particular benefit for younger people and those in regions where suicide support options are lacking.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide is the third leading cause of death for teens in the United States.﻿﻿ The rates of depression and suicide in U.S. teenagers have been increasing for decades.﻿﻿ 
 
Although many factors are involved, several studies suggest that adolescents who engage in high-risk behaviors are more likely to attempt suicide. Research has also suggested that sexual activity and illegal drug use significantly increase teens’ risk for depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts.
 
Teens growing up in the U.S. are well aware of the mental health challenges facing their generation: In 2018, a Pew Research survey found 70% of teens aged 13–17 consider mental health to be “a major problem” among their peers.﻿﻿ 
 
When teens were asked about specific issues of concern within their peer groups and communities, substance use and teen pregnancy were among the problems noted: 
 
In recent decades, the rates of substance use and sexual activity among U.S. teens have been decreasing, while the rates of depression and suicide have continued to increase. 
 
There’s little doubt these factors can contribute to poor mental health for teens, but the relationship is complex. For adults who are seeking to understand the impact of these factors and behaviors, seeking and reviewing the most recent research, data, and guidelines (as well as considering their context) is key to mitigating the effects and improving the mental health of teens.
 
Around 28% of U.S. high school students have experienced severe depression, and suicide is the third leading cause of death for teens between the ages of 15–19. For those who study adolescent mental health, the first step in preventing these rates from increasing (and finding ways to lower them) is figuring out what forces are driving them.
 
In 2004, a team of researchers lead by Denise D. Hallfors, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, analyzed various sex and drug behavior patterns via data from a survey of nearly 19,000 teens in grades 7–12. The data were gathered from 132 U.S. schools as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.﻿﻿
 
The researchers divided the teens into 16 groups according to their behaviors, including: 
 
The teens in the “abstainer” group reported the lowest levels of depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts, while the teens in groups associated with sex and illicit drug use reported the highest levels. 
 
Teens who were “dabblers” in sex, drugs, alcohol, and tobacco fell somewhere in the middle in terms of depression and suicide risk. 
 
The study found that female teens were less likely than males of the same age to pursue high-risk behaviors. However, the girls who did engage in these behaviors were more vulnerable to depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts than their male peers.
 
That's not to say that simply engaging in sexual behaviors means a teen will become depressed—the type and relationship context may make a difference. In 2018, a team of researchers at Cornell found that teens who engage in casual, non-romantic sex or “hookups” may be more prone to developing depression than their sexually-active peers who are in stable relationships.﻿﻿ 
 
Other studies have indicated that sexually-active teens who participate in “sexting” may be more likely to have mental health problems as well as be more likely to be delinquent.﻿﻿ However, previous research has indicated that academically, teens who are sexually active don’t do any better or worse in school than their abstinent peers.﻿﻿
 
While these behaviors and activities may influence mental health for teens who are or become sexually active, they may not be the majority in their peer group. Data presented in a January 2018 edition of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report indicated teens are waiting longer to have sex for the first time.
 In 1991, 53% of U.S. high schoolers had been sexually active. By 2005, the percentage had fallen to 47%. In 2015, the number of high school students who had ever had sex was down to 41%. In 2017, the rate had dropped to 39.5%.  
In fact, the rates of teens having sex have been on the decline for the last several decades.﻿﻿ One survey from 2018 put the percentage of teens who had ever had sex at just 40%—the lowest numbers since tracking began in 1991.﻿﻿ 
 
Research from 2018 indicates that teens are using drugs and alcohol at lower rates than in previous decades.﻿﻿ According to CDC data, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana continue to be the most commonly used substances by teens in the U.S.﻿﻿
 
With the exception of marijuana (the rates for which have remained steady)﻿﻿ and vaping (which has significantly increased),﻿﻿ drug and alcohol use among teens has also been declining. In 2018, the rate of use for tobacco was actually the lowest in the survey’s history. 
 
Teens are more likely to use marijuana every day than cigarettes. In response to an annual NIH survey, 71% of high school seniors said they don’t see much harm in using marijuana every day. However, in the same survey, 64% of high school seniors said they disapprove of daily marijuana use.﻿﻿
 
Self-reported student data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of illicit drug use among U.S. teens is declining. In 2007, 22.6% of teens reported they had tried at least one illicit drug. In 2017, only 14% of teens reported ever using drugs.﻿﻿ 
 
Hallfors’ study also found that the risk of depression for teens is reduced by half if they come from a family of higher socioeconomic status.﻿﻿ However, at the same time, coming from a higher socioeconomic background increased teens’ risk for suicidal thoughts.﻿﻿ 
 
While the association isn't completely clear, previous research lead by the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco in 2010 investigated the high rate of suicides in wealthy California neighborhoods. The study suggested that for higher-income families, social and economic pressure to ""keep up"" with others (such as neighbors, colleagues, etc.) likely contributes to stress which in turn raises the risk of depression and suicide.﻿﻿
 
The socio-economic circumstances of a teen's family may influence their mental and sexual health in other ways. Research has shown that growing up in a low-income family can be a stronger determinant of the age at which a teen becomes sexually active than genetics (which is generally regarded as a prominent influence).﻿﻿ Studies have shown that female teens who begin having sex at a younger age may be more prone to depression.﻿﻿
 
As noted by Pew Research, the downward trend in teen births over the last few decades occurred in the context of an economic recession.﻿﻿ Historically, birth rates are lower in all age groups during periods of economic depression.
 
While the overall birth rate in the U.S. began to recover as the economy did, however, the teen birth rate did not. In fact, it has continued to fall. The rates of teen pregnancy and parenthood have been steadily declining over the last decade. In 2018, the birth rate among teen girls was half of what it was in 2008.﻿﻿ 
 
At the end of her team's study, Hallfors said doctors treating adolescent patients should “strongly consider” screening teens for depression, as well as assessing their suicide risk if they report having sex and/or using drugs.
 
However, surveys of medical professionals have found that doctors may not be talking about sex﻿﻿ and drug use﻿﻿ with teen patients. These findings are concerning, but researchers are hoping to encourage and support these important dialogues between doctors and the adolescents they treat.  
 
Healthcare providers should ask all adolescent patients about sexual activity and drug use. Any teen who reports engaging in the behaviors, especially if more than “dabbling,” needs to be screened for depression and suicide risk. 
 
When talking to teens about the risks of sexual intercourse and drug use, studies have shown that harm reduction approaches are most effective (for example, when compared to abstinence-only sex education).﻿﻿
 
Research has also consistently indicated that providing information about and access to contraceptives to teens does not lead to increased sexual activity.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ 
 
For teens, emerging sexuality, peer pressure, and exposure to substances can cause stress. It's important that the adults around them (including parents, teachers, coaches, doctors, and counselors) understand how these behaviors can contribute to depression in teens. This includes being aware of the most current research and statistics and being able to use these facts to engage teens when discussing these topics freely—and without shame.
 
It's also important that preteens and teens have access to accurate and actionable information and resources to help them become more informed about their sexual health. Teenagers also need supportive adults to educate them on and help them recognize the signs of substance use problems. They also need to become familiar with the resources available at school or within their community from which they can seek help if they (or someone in their peer group) is using substances.
 Drug use: 51% of teens considered drug use a major problem among peers. Alcohol use: 45% of teens considered alcohol use a major problem among peers. Teen pregnancy: 34% of teens considered teen pregnancy a major problem among peers. “Abstainers” (completely avoid sex and drugs) Sex “dabblers” (experimentation with sexual behavior) Teens with

Hearing a teen say things like, ""I should just go kill myself,"" should be cause for alarm. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among teenagers. 
 
If your teen brings up the subject—even if you think it's a bid for attention—address it right away. Unfortunately, many teens complete suicide every year and often their stunned friends and family say they never imagined their loved one would do it.
 
If your teen is talking about or threatening to commit suicide, there are some things you should understand. There is a part of your teen that doesn't really want to die. Teens contemplating suicide likely feel utterly hopeless, out of control, and unable to cope. The pain they are experiencing is intense and substantial, and in this moment suicide seems the only way out.
 
Suicidal teens are looking for a way to stop their emotional pain. They are tired of hurting and tired of feeling like no one understands what they are going through.
 Some of the potential warning signs that a teen may be suicidal include talking about or threatening suicide. Mood swings, changes in routine, withdrawal from friends and family, risky or self-destructive behaviors, and giving away possessions are also signs that a child may be thinking about or at risk of suicide. 
If you suspect that your teen is considering suicide, talk about it immediately. Take it seriously and don't dismiss it as acting out, looking for attention, or teenage drama. Contrary to popular belief, talking about suicide doesn't plant suicidal ideas in their heads.
 
In fact, addressing the topic head-on can do the very opposite by helping your teen to know what to do if they have suicidal thoughts or behaviors. It can help them identify a problem and know how to ask for help.
 
If your teen mentions wanting to die or wishing they were dead, encourage them to talk to you about their distress.
 
These strategies can help your teen start talking:
 Ask if your teen has a specific plan for suicide. The more specific the plan, the higher the risk.  
After gaining a better understanding, it's important to offer your teen emotional support. Use the suggestions that best fit you, your teen, and the situation:
 
A teen who is talking about suicide could be in immediate danger to themself. Take your teen's comments seriously. There are a few things you can do to make safety a top priority.
 
First, remove all dangerous implements or substances from the immediate area. Stay with your teen—make sure your child is not left alone during this crisis. Once the immediate danger has been addressed, get ongoing help for your child. Therapy can treat and address underlying mental health issues and is crucial to alleviating your teen's distress.
 
Factors that can increase the risk of teen suicide include having a psychiatric condition (such as depression or anxiety), bullying issues, interpersonal issues, and substance use. Getting your teen help with such issues is an important part of suicide prevention.
 If you or your child are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Ask your teen to share whether a specific incident led to suicidal thoughts. Ask a question such as, ""What happened? I want to know more, it might help to talk about it."" Don't invalidate your teen's feelings. Avoid saying things that may be perceived as empty or unhelpful such as, ""You should appreciate all you have in life,"" or ""I think you're overreacting."" Those reactions downplay your teen's pain. Encourage your teen to describe what they're feeling. Say something like, ""I had no idea things were so bad for you, talk to me about what's going on."" Show acceptance. Listen without verbalizing judgment or disagreeing with their statements or feelings. Be specific and direct. As compassionately as possible say to your teen,""I do not want you to hurt yourself and I will do everything possibleto keep you from committing suicide."" Explain that you understand your teen feels miserable. Say something like, ""It sounds like you've given up"" or ""I think you feel there's no way out."" Gently point out that suicide is not a solution. Try saying something such as, ""I know there are options that could help, I'd like you to at least try them."" Let your teen know you are worried. Don't downplay your concern about their well-being. Promise to be there for your teen. Do whatever it takes to get them through this. Provide reassurance by saying something like, ""You are not alone. I am here to help you now that I understand how bad things really are for you."" Remind your teen of your unconditional love. Now is the time to show how much you care.",hear teen say things like kill cause alarm suicide second lead cause death among teenagers teen bring subject even think bid attention address right away unfortunately many teens complete suicide every year often stun friends family say never imagine love one would teen talk threaten commit suicide things understand part teen really want die teens contemplate suicide likely feel utterly hopeless control unable cope pain experience intense substantial moment suicide seem way suicidal teens look way stop emotional pain tire hurt tire feel like one understand potential warn sign teen may suicidal include talk threaten suicide mood swing change routine withdrawal friends family risky self destructive behaviors give away possessions also sign child may think risk suicide suspect teen consider suicide talk immediately take seriously dismiss act look attention teenage drama contrary popular belief talk suicide plant suicidal ideas head fact address topic head opposite help teen know suicidal thoughts behaviors help identify problem know ask help teen mention want die wish dead encourage talk distress strategies help teen start talk ask teen specific plan suicide specific plan higher risk gain better understand important offer teen emotional support use suggestions best fit teen situation teen talk suicide could immediate danger themself take teen comment seriously things make safety top priority first remove dangerous implement substances immediate area stay teen make sure child leave alone crisis immediate danger address get ongoing help child therapy treat address underlie mental health issue crucial alleviate teen distress factor increase risk teen suicide include psychiatric condition depression anxiety bully issue interpersonal issue substance use get teen help issue important part suicide prevention child suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database ask teen share whether specific incident lead suicidal thoughts ask question happen want know might help talk invalidate teen feel avoid say things may perceive empty unhelpful appreciate life think overreact reactions downplay teen pain encourage teen describe feel say something like idea things bad talk show acceptance listen without verbalize judgment disagree statements feel specific direct compassionately possible say teen want hurt everything possibleto keep commit suicide explain understand teen feel miserable say something like sound like give think feel way gently point suicide solution try say something know options could help like least try let teen know worry downplay concern well promise teen whatever take get provide reassurance say something like alone help understand bad things really remind teen unconditional love time show much care

If someone you love has clinical depression, there is a strong risk that they will at some point think about suicide. Although estimates vary, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that around 2% of people who have ever had outpatient treatment for depression die by suicide.﻿﻿
 
But depression is not the only risk factor for suicide. Suicide accounts for about 1.5% of all worldwide deaths. Other psychiatric conditions including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychosis can also be risk factors for suicide.﻿﻿ While there is a strong relationship between mental health and suicide and the risk is serious, it is important to remember that the majority of people with mental health conditions do not attempt or complete suicide. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 54% of people who die by suicide did not have a known mental health condition.﻿﻿
 
The best way to prevent suicide, according to Suicide Prevention Resources, is to make sure you know the risk factors and warning signs of suicide.﻿﻿
 
Risk factors can include both the situations a person experiences and how the person is feeling internally. Though it may be easier to recognize situations and times when suicide is more common, understanding how someone is feeling inside requires a little more detective work.
 
Certain conditions and situations are associated with an increased risk of suicide, including:
 
In addition, there are certain times when people may be more prone to suicidal feelings, such as:
 
Emotionally, the suicidal person may be feeling:﻿﻿
 
Behaviorally, the person may:﻿﻿
 
There are two different types of suicide risk factors: proximal risk factors and distal risk factors.
 
Suicide warning signs which you should be aware of include:﻿﻿
 If you observe any of these warning signs in your loved one, encourage them to seek help from a mental health professional. If they refuse, be persistent. If they appear to be in immediate danger of hurting themselves, do not leave them alone, remove any possible means that they can use to hurt themselves, and get them to an emergency room as soon as possible. 
While not exclusive to depression, suicidal thoughts are common among people with depression. If you are living with depression but do not feel suicidal, some people find it helpful to make up a contingency plan on the chance that they may feel suicidal in the future.
 
If you don't know if you should be concerned about a loved one and aren't ready to take them to the emergency room or call the suicide hotline, here are some things you can do.﻿﻿
 
Know the risk factors and warning signs. Be particularly concerned if your loved one shows multiple suicide warning signs.
 
Encourage a loved one with depression to seek help. Help them locate treatment resources such as a doctor, therapist, or suicide hotline.
 
Don't discount your loved one's feelings. Even if a situation seems easily fixable to you that doesn't mean that your loved one sees it the same way.
 Ask your loved one about suicidal thoughts. Many people are afraid that bringing up the idea of suicide will raise the likelihood it will occur. That's simply not true. 
Express your love. Even if you feel your love should be obvious through your actions, many people crave—and feel validated by—the expression of that love in words.
 
Share your feelings with one another. Your loved one may ask you to keep what they share with you to yourself and not tell anyone. But when it comes to suicide warning signs, not only is that ask not fair to you, but it may be in their best interest to involve others if needed. Use your best judgment, and make your loved one's health and safety your first priority.
 
While most people who attempt suicide do show some sort of warning signs, there are also those people who, because of social stigma or a desire to not appear weak, will successfully hide what they are feeling. If you fail to recognize that your loved one is considering or considered suicide, do not blame yourself. Remember that you did the best you could with the information you had.

There are many common misconceptions about suicide that prevent parents from talking to teens or recognizing just how serious of a problem suicide can be among teens. 
 
By debunking these seven common teen suicide myths and revealing the facts, you can hopefully be better prepared to educate your teen, recognize the warning signs, and get help for your teen before it's too late.
 
Teens usually excel at hiding problems, especially from adults. A teen who is talking about suicide needs to be listened to carefully and taken seriously.
 If your teen mentions suicide, take it very seriously and seek professional help immediately.  
Sometimes parents fear that bringing up the subject of suicide will somehow plant the seed. But asking direct questions about suicide won't compel your teen to kill themselves. But if your teen is having any suicidal thoughts, they will feel likely relieved by your direct and honest questions. 
 
A teen who attempts suicide is trying to stop the pain and suffering. Teens who make an attempt are at much higher risk of trying again. Their second attempts are much more likely to be lethal. 
 
Depression in teenagers looks different from depression in adults. Teens with depression frequently don’t appear sad. They may be irritable or withdrawn and might even seem happy at times. Suicide may be a rather sudden response to a major stressful event.
 
The decision to commit suicide may be planned—but it could also be somewhat of an impulsive one. Suicide may feel like the best way to escape the pain. A teen who has been humiliated, rejected, or subjected to bullying, for example, may think suicide is the only way out.
 
More teens die from suicide than cancer, pneumonia, influenza, chronic lung disease, heart disease, AIDS, and birth defects combined. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people.
 
Most people aren't aware that it such a common problem. Suicides don't usually make the news and many families keep a teen's suicide as private as possible.
 Teens who struggle with mental illness like depression and those who abuse substances are at the highest risk of taking their own life.  
A teen with a specific plan for how and when to commit suicide is a teen in serious trouble. When a mental health professional assesses a teen for suicide risk, meeting this criterion means the teen is potentially in immediate danger and steps need to be taken to ensure safety. 
 
Although many parents talk to their kids about the dangers of using alcohol or drugs or the risks of meeting strangers online, few parents ever talk to their teens about suicide.
 Mental health problems and suicide can be an uncomfortable subject to broach—especially when you aren't sure what to say. But talking about it could save your teen's life. 
Check-in with your child regularly, beyond just day-to-day tasks like doing homework, to find out how they are feeling. You can simply ask: ""How are you doing?"" or ""How is everything going at school?"" Kids might open up as you're in the car, shuffling back and forth to after-school activities.
 
Learning about and understanding suicide will enable you to be on the lookout for possible signs your teen may be at risk. It will also help you hold meaningful conversations with your teen on the subject.
 
This includes understanding the risks factors and warning signs of suicide in teens, including:
 
Strike up a conversation with your teen about mental health issues, stress, and suicide. You might start by mentioning a story you read about the news or a TV show that you watched on the topic.
 You might also ask questions like, ""Does anyone at your school ever talk about suicide?"" or ""Does your school teach you about mental health issues?""  
Don’t be afraid to steer the conversation toward your child's mental health. If you have concerns that your teen may be contemplating suicide, or your teen is struggling with mental health issues or a recent stressful event, you might say, ""It seems like you've been dealing with a lot lately. Does it ever get so tough that you think about ending your life?” notes the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP).
 
Ask if they are experiencing any symptoms like trouble sleeping, feelings of hopelessness, or feeling trapped or overwhelmed. Reinforce the fact that you are always there to listen to and support them and that it's OK to seek help. It's also essential to talk to your child's doctor immediately. A pediatrician may refer your teen to a mental health professional. 
 
Teaching and modeling healthy habits for mental health is yet another way parents can help protect their teens from suicide. Do your best to talk openly about feelings, emotions, and challenges. This will help them understand that it's OK to struggle and that ""life is messy and challenging for everyone,"" says the AFSP.
 
If you're struggling with your own mental health, set a good example by practicing physical and mental self-care, managing stress in a healthful way, and seeking therapy. Doing your part to take away the stigma of mental illness treatment will go a long way toward dispelling any harmful myths and keeping your teen safe.

While you might think stretching, breathing, and focusing on your posture can’t possibly improve your psychological well-being, there’s growing evidence that yoga can be effective in reducing depression.
 
Traditional treatment for depression usually involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication. But not everyone responds well to these types of evidence-based treatments. Only one-third of individuals receive relief from their first trial with antidepressants.﻿﻿
 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in mind-body practices that can improve psychological well-being. Yoga, in particular, has shown a sharp increase in popularity over the last decade. One study found that the percentage of the US population who had practiced yoga increased from 5.8% in 2002 to 10.1% in 2012.﻿﻿
 
There are many studies that have found yoga can decrease symptoms of depression. In fact, some studies have found that yoga is just as effective as antidepressants and exercise in reducing symptoms of depression.﻿﻿
 
Researchers found that yoga provides immediate relief as well as long-term symptom reduction.﻿﻿ It also decreases symptom severity and increases treatment remission rates. 
 
While the number of studies on yoga and depression are increasing, there are still many questions about how to research the topic. Here are some of the reasons research on the impact yoga can have on depression is complicated:
 
Some research has been conducted on specific populations, such as women or expectant mothers. Here’s what studies reveal about how yoga can affect depression in these specific populations.
 
A 2019 study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Practice found that yoga can be a helpful complementary treatment for clinical depression or major depressive disorder.﻿﻿ Within one month of beginning a yoga practice, participants’ sleep quality significantly improved. Tranquility and positivity increased while physical exhaustion, and symptoms of anxiety and depression decreased.
 
It’s important to note that it was a small study with only 30 participants. And the researchers were trying to determine the correct “dose” of yoga.
 One group spent practiced yoga three times a week for 90 minutes each over three months, while the other group practiced yoga two times per week for 90 minutes each. The positive results for both groups were the same.﻿﻿  
A 2016 study published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine examined how mindfulness-based yoga compared to walking as an alternative treatment for depression.﻿﻿
 
There have been many studies finding that physical activities like walking can reduce depressive symptoms. But when researchers examined two groups of women with depression—one walking and the other practicing mindfulness-based yoga—they found that the yoga group experienced better results after 12 weeks.
 
While both groups experienced an improvement in their symptoms, the mindfulness-based yoga group reported significantly lower levels of rumination (which can trigger depression) after the study ended.
 Reducing rumination might be key to helping women keep their depression in remission. 
Depression is common in expectant mothers who are placed on bedrest due to high-risk pregnancies.﻿﻿ Social isolation, lack of activity, boredom, and physical health concerns, are just a few stressors women on bedrest often experience—and all of these factors can contribute to depression and anxiety.
 
Treatment for depression can be complicated for this population as medication may not be a safe option. Attending traditional therapy sessions in an office setting isn’t likely an option either.
 
Research shows that yoga may be quite beneficial to women on bedrest. A 2020 study published in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice found that as few as three sessions were helpful in reducing anxiety and depression for high-risk pregnant women on bedrest.﻿﻿
 
Depression and anxiety are common among individuals who have entered rehabilitation for an alcohol or drug addiction. Studies show that yoga may be a promising form of treatment.
 
A 2011 study published in Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences found that yoga significantly reduced both anxiety and depression in individuals who were in a rehabilitation clinic.﻿﻿ Participants in the study attended three 60-minute yoga sessions per week for five weeks.
 The researchers found that the impact yoga had on the body—including the nervous system and various hormones—seemed instrumental in reducing participants’ symptoms.﻿﻿ 
They recommended that yoga be prescribed to individuals recovering from addiction as a complementary form of treatment that can make medication and therapy even more effective.
 
If you’re feeling depressed, or your current depression treatment isn’t working as well as you’d like, talk to your physician about whether yoga might be an option. Your physician may be able to help you find the most helpful type of yoga for your depression. Your physician may also be able to recommend a good yoga instructor or program that may reduce your symptoms.
 
There’s still a lot of research that needs to be done on yoga to determine which types of yoga work best, how often yoga should be practiced, and how it can address specific symptoms of depression. But clearly the evidence so far shows that it may be an effective complementary treatment that can be good for your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
 
So don’t underestimate the power of stretching, breathing, and reaching. You might find that a few simple yoga exercises might be powerful ways to boost your mood and reduce your symptoms of depression.
 
The best news is that yoga may provide some immediate relief to your symptoms. Additionally, a regular yoga practice may reduce your symptoms of depression in the long-term as well. 
 Some studies include individuals who feel depressed but aren’t necessarily diagnosed with depression. There are many different types of yoga which makes comparing studies more complicated. Yoga likely affects each population in a slightly different manner.",might think stretch breathe focus posture possibly improve psychological well grow evidence yoga effective reduce depression traditional treatment depression usually involve combination psychotherapy medication everyone respond well type evidence base treatments one third individuals receive relief first trial antidepressants recent years grow interest mind body practice improve psychological well yoga particular show sharp increase popularity last decade one study find percentage population practice yoga increase many study find yoga decrease symptoms depression fact study find yoga effective antidepressants exercise reduce symptoms depression researchers find yoga provide immediate relief well long term symptom reduction also decrease symptom severity increase treatment remission rat number study yoga depression increase still many question research topic reason research impact yoga depression complicate research conduct specific populations women expectant mother study reveal yoga affect depression specific populations study publish journal psychiatric practice find yoga helpful complementary treatment clinical depression major depressive disorder within one month begin yoga practice participants sleep quality significantly improve tranquility positivity increase physical exhaustion symptoms anxiety depression decrease important note small study participants researchers try determine correct dose yoga one group spend practice yoga three time week minutes three months group practice yoga two time per week minutes positive result group study publish complementary therapies medicine examine mindfulness base yoga compare walk alternative treatment depression many study find physical activities like walk reduce depressive symptoms researchers examine two group women depression one walk practice mindfulness base yoga find yoga group experience better result weeks group experience improvement symptoms mindfulness base yoga group report significantly lower level rumination trigger depression study end reduce rumination might key help women keep depression remission depression common expectant mother place bedrest due high risk pregnancies social isolation lack activity boredom physical health concern stressors women bedrest often experience factor contribute depression anxiety treatment depression complicate population medication may safe option attend traditional therapy sessions office set likely option either research show yoga may quite beneficial women bedrest study publish complementary therapies clinical practice find three sessions helpful reduce anxiety depression high risk pregnant women bedrest depression anxiety common among individuals enter rehabilitation alcohol drug addiction study show yoga may promise form treatment study publish procedia social behavioral sciences find yoga significantly reduce anxiety depression individuals rehabilitation clinic participants study attend three minute yoga sessions per week five weeks researchers find impact yoga body include nervous system various hormones seem instrumental reduce participants symptoms recommend yoga prescribe individuals recover addiction complementary form treatment make medication therapy even effective feel depress current depression treatment work well like talk physician whether yoga might option physician may able help find helpful type yoga depression physician may also able recommend good yoga instructor program may reduce symptoms still lot research need yoga determine type yoga work best often yoga practice address specific symptoms depression clearly evidence far show may effective complementary treatment good physical mental spiritual well underestimate power stretch breathe reach might find simple yoga exercise might powerful ways boost mood reduce symptoms depression best news yoga may provide immediate relief symptoms additionally regular yoga practice may reduce symptoms depression long term well study include individuals feel depress necessarily diagnose depression many different type yoga make compare study complicate yoga likely affect population slightly different manner

Pleasant activity scheduling, which is also referred to as behavioral activation, is a therapy technique that is often used to treat individuals with mental health conditions such as depression.
 
It involves scheduling and participating in positive events that are meant to boost an individual’s mood. Pleasant activity scheduling is recognized as an evidence-based treatment that is effective in reducing a variety of mental health symptoms.
 
Individuals who are experiencing depression often isolate themselves. They may stop engaging in activities they previously enjoyed, and they may decline social invitations.
 
Withdrawing from activities may increase their depression. Their symptoms may last longer and become more intense which may increase their tendency to isolate themselves even more.
 
To help break out of this cycle, a therapist may assist a client in identifying an activity that might boost their mood. Eating dinner with a friend, going to the gym, or playing a round of golf might help someone feel better.
 But therapists don’t just assist clients in picking a random fun activity. Instead, they help clients identify their values. They rank how important specific values are to them such as work, education, volunteering, intimacy, family, friendship, spirituality, entertainment, and health. 
Then, the therapist assists in gathering concrete activities that support these values. Someone who values friendship, for example, might enjoy having coffee or watching movies with a friend. Once concrete activities are identified, the therapist encourages the client to schedule some of these activities that are important to their values.
 
Next, they review the results with the therapist and determine a course of further action. Clients who found the activity helpful in boosting their moods may continue scheduling it. Those who didn’t find the activity helpful may work with the therapist on finding other ones that may boost their moods.
 
Scheduling a pleasant activity may help in two different ways:
 
Pleasant activity scheduling has been around since the 1970s. Initially, it was incorporated into cognitive behavioral therapy.
 
Cognitive behavior therapists assist individuals in replacing the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that contribute to distress. So while an individual may be learning how to reframe thoughts that fuel their depression, they might also be learning how to increase their activity level.
 
But research indicates that pleasant activity scheduling can be an effective stand-alone intervention.
 
In fact, some individuals with severe depression may struggle to replace irrational thoughts—which is a key component in cognitive behavioral therapy. Additionally, addressing their unhealthy thoughts may actually increase their feelings of guilt (a common symptom of depression).
 
Therefore, pleasant activity scheduling may be an even more effective way to improve mood when it’s used as a standalone intervention for depression.
 
Here are some other things research reveals about pleasant activity scheduling:
 The overwhelmingly positive studies on pleasant activity scheduling have helped make it an evidence-based treatment. It’s used by many practitioners who are looking to improve the mental health of their clients. 
Pleasant activity scheduling is customized to each client. While the therapist assists the client in identifying the activities they want to engage in, it’s up to the client to make the decisions on what they want to do and when they want to do it. Here are a few examples of how pleasant activity scheduling may be used in treatment:
 
If you notice some mild symptoms of depression, you might find adding some pleasant activities to your regular routine helps you manage your symptoms. If, however, you’re struggling to feel better on your own, talk with your physician or consult with a therapist
 
You might find a therapist who encourages behavioral activation to be quite helpful in boosting your mood and helping you feel better. 
 The act of scheduling an activity may give the individual something to look forward to. As soon as they make plans, they may experience a boost in mood. Then, when they engage in the activity, they’re likely to experience an even brighter mood which can help them break out of a downward spiral. It’s effective in group settings. A 2019 study﻿﻿ published in Behavioral Therapy concluded that “behavioral activation delivered in groups produces a moderate to large effect on depressive symptoms and should be considered an appropriate front-line treatment option.” It may help you stop smoking. A 2020 study﻿﻿ published in Addictive Behaviors found that behavioral activation reduced the relapse rate in individuals who quit smoking since depression is often a factor that makes quitting difficult. Pleasant activity scheduling was effective in decreasing depressive symptoms while also increasing the chances that individuals would successfully stop smoking. It may be more effective than other types of treatment for certain individuals. Individuals with lifelong depression, substance abuse issues, dementia, and severe depression may not respond well to the cognitive components of cognitive behavioral therapy. A 2009 study﻿﻿ published in Behavior Modification found that these same individuals may experience relief from their symptoms when they engage in pleasant activity scheduling. The study also found that it may be superior to paroxetine (an antidepressant medication) in treating depression because it results in less relapse and recurrence, may be substantially cheaper, and does not have the risks associated with medication. A man developed depression after being laid off from his job. He spent his days at home watching TV and had little social interaction. His therapist helped him identify ways to increase his social interactions. He agreed to locate and attend one networking event each week. He also began meeting with a family member for coffee every morning. Increasing his social activity helped him feel happier and more hopeful about the future. A woman experienced depression for many years. She struggled with low energy, and consequently, she stopped going to the gym even though her health was important to her. She worked with her therapist on identifying some activities she was willing to try like going on a hike with friends. She scheduled one activity per week for a month and found that her mood slowly began to improve. A college student reported feeling depressed during his first year of college. His therapist discovered that he spent a lot of time in his dorm room alone. The therapist asked about activities he used to enjoy doing and discovered that he was very involved in his church when he was in high school. The client agreed to attend local church services. After several weeks of participating, he found that his mood gradually became better. A manager was given permission to work remotely. Initially, she liked the flexibility of working from home. But within a few months, she grew depressed. Her therapist helped her identify activities that could help her feel connected to the outside world. She began walking every morning, working from a coffee shop two afternoons per week, and attending the gym three evenings per week. Her symptoms of depression decreased as her social engagement increased.",pleasant activity schedule also refer behavioral activation therapy technique often use treat individuals mental health

Depression is treatable and most people see improvements in their symptoms when treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.
 
But treatment should be individualized. What works for one person might not necessarily work for another. It's important to talk to your physician and treatment team about which options may be most effective in reducing your depression.
 
The word ""therapy"" is used to describe many different types of treatments. Psychotherapists often use a specific type of therapy to treat depression. Some of them use an eclectic approach, based on a client's treatment needs. 
 While there are many different types of therapy, a 2013 study examined which therapies are most effective for depression. Researchers found that the following therapies were equally effective in reducing depression. 
Family or couple therapy may be considered when depression affects others in the household. Therapy that involves other family members focuses on the interpersonal relationships.
 
The roles played by various family members in a patient's depression may be examined. Education about depression in a general way may also be a part of family therapy.﻿﻿
 
Hospitalization may become necessary when it is deemed that a patient has become a danger to himself or others. A patient who is seriously considering suicide, for example, may require inpatient hospitalization.﻿﻿
 
Hospitalization may involve individual therapy, family therapy, and group therapy. A patient may also be prescribed medication. Once a patient is safe to leave the hospital, an intensive outpatient program, such as a partial hospital may be recommended. These services take place for several hours each day to help support a person's recovery from their depression. 
 
There are many different medications that can help reduce the symptoms of depression.
 Most studies have found medication is most effective when it is used in conjunction with therapy. 
Here are some classes of medication that are commonly used to treat depression: 
 
Self-help methods for the treatment of depression may be helpful for someone who is unable to access professional resources or to someone with mild symptoms. Self-help strategies may include the following:
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Interpersonal therapy is relatively short in duration. Sessions are highly structured. It's based on the idea that your relationships are at the forefront of depression. The goal of treatment is to help patients improve skills, such as communication skills and conflict-resolution skills.  Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on helping people identify and replace cognitive distortions and behavioral patterns that reinforce depressive feelings. It is usually short-term and it focuses on present problems and skills teaching.  Social skills therapy teaches patients how to establish healthy relationships. The goal is for patients to improve communication and learn how to build a strong social network with individuals based on honesty and respect.  Psychodynamic therapy is often featured in movies or pop culture. It involves helping patients explore their unconscious and unhealed emotional wounds from the past. The goal is to help people learn how their depression is related to past experiences and unresolved conflicts. The therapist helps patients address those issues so they can move forward in a productive manner.  Supportive counseling is unstructured and focuses on listening to the patient. Patients are invited to address whatever issues they want to talk about and the therapist uses empathy to provide understanding and support. Behavioral activation raises awareness of pleasant activities. The therapist seeks to increase positive interactions between the patient and the environment. By getting active and engaging in more pleasurable activities, symptoms of depression may be reduced. Problem-solving therapy aims to define a patient's problems. Then, multiple solutions are offered. The therapist helps the patient evaluate options and choose a solution.﻿﻿ Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) — were among the first developed antidepressants. They have more side effects than newer antidepressants but can be more effective for certain patients. These include Elavil (amitriptyline), Tofranil (imipramine) and Pamelor (nortriptyline).  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) — are another older type of antidepressant. If you are taking an MAOI, you will have to follow certain dietary restrictions to prevent a reaction that can cause high blood pressure. You will also have to be careful about interactions with certain other medications. Like tricyclics, these are not generally used first line, but can sometimes be helpful for more difficult to treat depressions. MAOIs include Marplan (isocarboxazid), Nardil (phenelzine) and Parnate (tranylcypromine). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — are the most commonly prescribed medication for depression today. Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Zoloft (sertraline) Celexa (citalopram) and Luvox (fluvoxamine) are commonly prescribed brand names. Compared to other antidepressant types, SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects. SSRIs should not be prescribed in conjunction with the older MAOIs due to the potential for a dangerously high level of serotonin to build up, which can cause serotonin syndrome.  Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — are a newer type of antidepressant that works similarly to SSRIs only they also block the reuptake of norepinephrine along with serotonin. Common medications in this class are Effexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Pristiq (deslavenfaxine). Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) — Wellbutrin (bupropion) is in a class all by itself. Wellbutrin is less likely to have the sexual side effects that are common in the other antidepressants.﻿﻿ Esketamine — Sold under the brand name Spravato, esketamine was FDA approved in March 2019. It is approved for adults with treatment-resistant depression, meaning other medication options have not worked for them, and needs to be prescribed together with an oral antidepressant. The medication itself is a nasal spray that works quickly in the body—within hours, compared to the weeks or months other medications take to work. However, there are risks associated with it. Esketamine is a variant of the hallucinogenic drug ketamine and may cause sedation and out-of-body experiences. Patients receiving the drug are monitored for several hours after taking it, and can only receive the drug at a certified location.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Support groups — They allow you to talk to other people who can relate to the issues and symptoms you are experiencing. Many people report support groups to reassure them that they're not alone and provide them with ideas and resources.﻿﻿ Online resources — There are many websites, newsletters, and online programs that specifically help people with depression.  Self-help books — Books can offer many of the same skills that people gain in therapy but it requires readers to be able to apply the information to their own lives. Many self-help books are available for free through local libraries.﻿﻿",depression treatable people see improvements symptoms treat medication psychotherapy combination two treatment individualize

With a preference for convenience and instant feedback, artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining ground with patients in mental and behavioral health care. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), major depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health conditions in the United States.
 
Depression may be common, but many people are not able to access treatment. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA)'s 2016 report on drug use and health, only 63% of adults identified as having had at least one major depressive episode reported receiving any kind of treatment.
 
For teens with major depression, the numbers are even more concerning: According to SAMHSA's survey, only 40% of teens who had at least one major depressive episode received treatment.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Statistics on people with depression who cannot get treatment has prompted the development of alternative pathways to mental health care, many of which leverage technological advancements. Here are a few ways AI could be used to help people manage depression, as well as what the technology can't do.
 
In the model of emotionally focused therapy, a person who is emotionally safe is accessible, responsive, and engaging. These are the qualities researchers and programmers in the field of AI hope to bring to technology-based mental health care.
 
AI apps can provide unprecedented accessibility by being available 24/7 at little to no cost. The programs collect data that allow them to create a level of therapeutic rapport with users and offer relevant responses.
 
The level of engagement continues to develop as the program learns more about the user and collects additional data. Through this process, the app is able to better detect and work toward meeting a user's individual behavioral and emotional health goals and needs.
 
Many people value their privacy and enjoy the anonymity technology can provide. Considering the sensitive and personal nature of the content shared in counseling and therapy, programs using AI that can be used anonymously by users can be an appealing asset.
 
AI-based depression resources also hope to address other barriers to mental health treatment, such as a lack of providers in rural areas, the stigma associated with mental illness, and feelings of fear, guilt, or shame that may stop someone with depression from reaching out to others.
 
There are several potential benefits to using AI to help manage depression, from improved access to coordinated care, but the technology also has some limitations.
 
Traditional outpatient counseling involves scheduling an appointment once or twice per week to meet with a therapist for a 50-minute session. To make an appointment, you need to find a time in a therapist's schedule that suits your schedule.
 
To attend your scheduled sessions consistently, you may have to ask for time off at work or school or make other arrangements (such as for childcare). You also need to factor in the time it takes you to commute to and from an office, which will vary depending on how close counseling resources are to where you live.
 
The ability to access mental health resources that are convenient and low cost are major benefits of apps and programs created with artificial intelligence. Most mental health apps and platforms available provide resources users can access anywhere from a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. They're also available at any time. You can use the apps day or night, on weekends, holidays, or any other time that works for your schedule.
 
Compared to the cost of therapy fees, as well as accounting for missed work, commuting, and other needs, these apps are also low to no-cost alternatives.
 
In the field of mental health, a major predictor of positive counseling experience is the rapport developed between clients and counselors. The relationship built in therapy establishes trust and creates a safe space to express challenging emotions and discuss difficult experiences.
 
Forging connection is a key part of the healing process. Those developing artificial intelligence-based apps consult a wealth of amount of data and research to create programs that help people to feel connected and understood.
 
In addition to building an emotional connection, AI can connect people to the help they need in situations where they otherwise wouldn't have access. In rural and remote areas, mental health resources can be few and far between. Furthermore, the resources that are available may not have the capacity to meet the demands of the whole community.
 According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, an estimated 106 million people in the United States live in areas referred to as Health Care Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). 
The ability to access and use mental health resources that are designed using artificial intelligence can be a lifeline of hope for people in areas where there is little to no affordable, accessible, and available help.
 
As much as humans are wired for connection and can recognize the benefits of personal counseling and therapy for treating depression, obstacles can prevent people from getting the help they need.
 
The stigma attached to mental illness and its treatment has lessened to a degree but is still present in society. The influence of depression stigma can make it harder for people to feel empowered and safe in seeking treatment.
 
The use of mobile apps and artificial intelligence platforms allows people to receive mental health services within the safety of their own personal living space, which eliminates the possibility of others knowing someone is receiving care, such as by crossing paths with an acquaintance when headed to a counselor's office.
 
Much of what would be discussed in counseling for depression involves emotional hurt, painful experiences and fear, and other tough topics that leave people feeling vulnerable. For some, discussing and sharing this information anonymously, and through a screen rather than face-to-face, can be less intimidating.
 
The ability to maintain one's privacy when discussing mental health coupled with the flexibility to do so when it's convenient and from one's own space makes these AI-designed apps for depression appealing and potentially useful. However, there are some limitations to the technology that should be kept in mind.
 
Many of the obstacles that can prevent people from seeking and receiving help for depression are removed, or at least minimized, by AI-driven apps and programs.
 But while research and development of technology-based mental health resources continue to improve, these apps are not intended to replace the clinical treatment of any mental health condition, including depression. 
It's also essential that clinicians are educated on how to use AI technology with their patients. A global survey of more than 700 psychiatrists found that while the majority believe AI will become a regular part of their clinical practice (particularly to perform documentation), many were not convinced of the technology's therapeutic benefits—especially compared to the potential risks.
 
Below are a few examples of popular AI-based technology that's available to help people manage depression. Although the apps cannot diagnose or treat a mental health condition, they may be complementary for people working with a doctor or mental health practitioner.
 
WoeBot launched in the summer of 2017 and is referred to as an automated conversational agent, also known as a chatbot. It is designed to offer convenient care to those struggling with depression by mimicking human conversation, offering self-help related guidance and companionship to its users.
 
The program can share with you information and resources, such as videos and exercises, based on what it thinks you are needing at that time. WoeBot can be used anonymously on iOS and you can also chat with it through Facebook Messenger.
 
The basis of WoeBot is designed with influence from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapeutic framework that works to help people change their unhelpful thinking and behaviors, ideally leading to improved mood and decision making.
 
As you continue to chat with WoeBot, it collects data through natural language processing (NLP) and uses this information to get to know you better.
 
The collected information allows for the program to more accurately detect and meet your emotional needs at a given time, offering personalized resources, self-help guidance, information and support related to your concerns.
 
Wysa is an artificial intelligence-based, ""emotionally intelligent"" bot that the company says can ""help you manage your emotions and thoughts.""
 
Like WoeBot, Wysa's designed based on principles of CBT to help users challenge and change thoughts and behaviors. Wysa also incorporates dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), meditation practices, and motivational interviewing into chats.
 
Wysa can be used anonymously, though as with other AI apps, it collects data as users chat to improve the accuracy of its interpretation of a user's behavioral and mental health needs and goals.﻿﻿
 
Although the chatbot service is free, the company that developed Wysa suggests users purchase a monthly subscription that provides the opportunity to interact with a human Wysa coach.
 
X2AI's Tess is described as ""a psychological AI that administers highly personalized psycho-education and health-related reminders on demand.""
 
The program is a text-based messaging conversation that users can access through Facebook Messenger, SMS texting, web browsers, and smartphone apps.
 
Through consistent messaging, the data Tess accumulates informs its responses with the aim of providing guidance that's most relevant to the user. Together with tracking a user's goals, the interventions suggested by Tess are influenced by the framework of cognitive-behavioral therapy.
 
This free app for iOS and Android uses AI chatbot technology to help users talk through their symptoms, behaviors, and patterns. The company calls Youper an ""emotional health assistant,"" that provides personalized feedback and insights based on what it learns in daily text-based conversations with users.
 
At the beginning of a chat session, users can communicate what they need from Youper. For example, a user might want help managing chronic depression or may need tips for feeling less anxious at the moment.
 
As users are chatting with Youper, the bot culls through various psychological techniques (such as CBT) to provide the user with helpful guidance based on their needs and goals.
 
At the end of a conversation, Youper provides a summary that can help users track symptoms, moods, and patterns over time.
 
Apps, platforms, and other technology that uses artificial intelligence to help people manage depression and other mental health conditions offer many benefits, but they do have limitations. Although these products address gaps in access and may help people overcome barriers to seeking mental health support and resources, they are not intended to replace clinicians in diagnosing conditions or prescribing medical or psychiatric treatment.

"
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Its main goals are to teach people how to live in the moment, develop healthy ways to cope with stress, regulate their emotions, and improve their relationships with others.﻿﻿
 DBT was originally intended to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD), but it has been adapted to treat other mental health conditions. 
DBT can help people who have difficulty with emotional regulation or are exhibiting self-destructive behaviors (eating disorders and substance use disorders).﻿﻿ DBT is sometimes used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
 
DBT was developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Marsha Linehan and colleagues when they discovered that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) alone did not work as well as expected in patients with BPD. Dr. Linehan and her team added techniques and developed a treatment to meet the unique needs of these patients.
 
DBT incorporates a philosophical process called dialectics. Dialectics is based on the concept that everything is composed of opposites and that change occurs when there is a ""dialogue"" between opposing forces.
 
In more academic terms, dialectics can be summarized as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.﻿﻿ The process makes three basic assumptions:
 In DBT, a patient and therapist work to resolve the apparent contradiction between self-acceptance and change to bring about positive changes in the patient. 
Another technique offered by Linehan and her colleagues was validation. Linehan and her team found that when validation was used along with the push for change, patients were more likely to cooperate and less likely to suffer distress at the idea of change.
 
In practice, the therapist validates that a patient's actions ""make sense"" within the context of their personal experiences without necessarily agreeing that they are the best approach to solving a problem.
 
DBT has evolved to become an evidence-based psychotherapy approach that is used to treat many conditions. DBT is used in three therapeutic settings.﻿﻿
 In DBT, individual therapists also meet with a consultation team to help them cope with the emotional demands of treating their patients. Consultation teams also help therapists navigate difficult and complex issues related to providing therapy. 
Each therapeutic setting has its own structure and goals, but the characteristics of DBT can be found in group skills training, individual psychotherapy, and phone coaching.﻿﻿
 
People undergoing DBT are taught how to effectively change their behavior using four main strategies.﻿﻿
 
Perhaps the most important strategy used in DBT is developing mindfulness skills. Mindfulness helps you focus on the present or “live in the moment.” This helps you pay attention to what is happening inside you (your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and impulses) as well as using your senses to tune in to what's happening around you (what you see, hear, smell, and touch) in nonjudgmental ways.
 
Mindfulness skills help you slow down and focus on using healthy coping skills when you are in the midst of emotional pain. The strategy can also help you stay calm and avoid engaging in automatic negative thought patterns and impulsive behavior.
 Pay attention to your breath. Take note of the sensation of inhaling and exhaling. Watch your belly rise and fall as you breathe. 
Distress tolerance skills help you accept yourself and your current situation. You will four techniques for handling a crisis:
 
Distress tolerance techniques help prepare you for intense emotions and empower you to cope with them with a more positive long-term outlook.
 Run up and down the stairs. If you're inside, go outside. If you're sitting, get up and walk around. The idea is to distract yourself by allowing your emotions to follow your body. 
Interpersonal effectiveness helps you to become more assertive in a relationship (for example, expressing your needs and be able to say ""no"") while still keeping a relationship positive and healthy. You will learn to listen and communicate more effectively, deal with challenging people, and respect yourself and others.
 Use the acronym GIVE to improve relationships and positive communication: 
Emotion regulation lets you navigate powerful feelings in a more effective way. The skills you learn will help you to identify, name, and change your emotions. When you are able to recognize and cope with intense negative emotions (for example, anger), it reduces your emotional vulnerability and helps you have more positive emotional experiences.
 Identify how you're feeling and do the opposite. If you are feeling sad and want to withdraw from friends and family, make plans to see your loved ones. 
Most DBT research has focused on its effectiveness for people with borderline personality disorder who have thoughts of suicide and self-harm, but the method could also be a successful treatment for other mental health conditions.﻿﻿
 
DBT might be an effective treatment for:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Researchers have also found that DBT is effective regardless of a person's age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity.﻿﻿ That said, the only way to find out if DBT is right for you is to talk with a professional who is trained in the method. They will evaluate your symptoms, treatment history, and therapy goals to see if DBT might be a good fit.
 
If you or a loved one might benefit from DBT, it's important to talk with a healthcare provider or mental health professional who is trained in the approach. That said, it's not always easy to find DBT therapists.
 
You can start your search with the Clinical Resource Directory, which is maintained by Behavioral Tech (an organization founded by Dr. Linehan to train mental health professionals in DBT). The directory lets you search by state for clinicians and programs with DBT training through Behavioral Tech, LLC, or the Behavioral Research and Therapy Clinics at the University of Washington.
 
You can also ask your provider, current therapist, or another trusted mental health professional to refer you to a colleague who specializes in DBT.
 All things are interconnected. Change is constant and inevitable. Opposites can be integrated to form a closer approximation of the truth. Group settings where patients are taught behavioral skills by completing homework assignments and role-playing new ways of interacting with others. Individual therapy with a trained professional where a patient's learned behavioral skills are adapted to their personal life challenges. Phone coaching in which patients can call the therapist between sessions to receive guidance on coping with a difficult situation they are currently in. Acceptance and change. You’ll learn strategies to accept and tolerate your life circumstances, emotions, and yourself. You will also develop skills that can help you make positive changes in your behaviors and interactions with others. Behavioral. You'll learn to analyze problems or destructive behavior patterns and replace them with more healthy and effective ones. Cognitive. You'll focus on changing thoughts, beliefs, behaviors, and actions that are not effective or helpful.   Collaboration. You'll learn to communicate effectively and work together as a team (therapist, group therapist, psychiatrist). Skill sets. You’ll learn new skills to enhance your capabilities. Support. You'll be encouraged to recognize your positive strengths and attributes and develop and use them. Distraction Improving the moment Self-soothing Thinking of the pros and cons of not tolerating distress Gentle. Don't attack, threaten, or judge others Interest. Show interest with good listening skills (don't interrupt someone else to speak) Validate. Acknowledge the other person's thoughts and feelings Easy. Try to have an easy attitude (smile often and be light-hearted) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Bipolar disorder Eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and

Often when people use the term doctor, what they're referring to is a Doctor of Medicine, or M.D. Technically, though, anyone who possesses a doctoral-level degree is referred to as a doctor, including psychologists who will generally have either a Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology (Ph.D.) or Doctor of Psychology (PsyD). So, in that sense, they are indeed doctors—not ones attending medical school.
 
It's also important to note that, in some states, masters-level graduates are allowed to provide psychotherapy and psychological assessment under the supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist. So, if working with a mental health professional who has a doctoral-level degree is important to you, be sure to inquire about the specifics of their education.
 
Licensed psychologists have a Ph.D., Psy.D., or EdD. degree, which is one of the highest levels of education. Training begins by earning a bachelor's degree, followed by an average of seven years of additional training and education.﻿﻿
 
Graduate training for psychologists includes a supervised internship as well as a year of supervised practice before gaining licensure. In order to become a licensed psychologist, professionals must also pass state and national examinations.
 
While psychologists are doctors, they cannot prescribe and administer medical treatments for depression, such as medications or procedures like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
 
A psychologist primarily works in one of two areas: psychological research and administration or working with patients through counseling and/or psychotherapy.
 
Counseling tends to be a short-term type of intervention aimed at helping the patient work through their problems. Psychotherapy, on the other hand, involves working with the patient on a long-term basis to delve into their thought processes and way of being in the world in order to determine why they are experiencing the problems they are and how to better cope with them.﻿﻿
 Although psychologists usually cannot prescribe medications, there are some exceptions to this rule. 
Certain entities including the states of Illinois, New Mexico, and Louisiana as well as in the Public Health Service, the U.S. military, and Guam do allow appropriately-trained clinical psychologists to prescribe medication, but with certain limitations.
 
While psychologists cannot prescribe medications in most cases, they do provide other essential mental health services. Licensed psychologists can diagnose psychological conditions, administer tests and assessments, perform psychotherapy, teach coping skills, and more.﻿﻿ 
 
They frequently help people by providing talk therapy, of which there are many different types. The kind of psychotherapy that a psychologist uses may depend upon their background and training, as well as the unique characteristics of your condition. Types of psychotherapy include behavior, cognitive, cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, psychodynamic, and interpersonal. 
 
Psychologists may help people with psychological problems such as depression or anxiety. They may also work to help people who are having short-term difficulties such as stress from a job loss or grief following the death of a loved one. These mental health professionals may also work with people who have addictions to alcohol or other substances to develop new coping strategies. 
 
In most cases, if you need medications or other medical treatments for your depression, then you will need to visit a different type of mental health professional called a psychiatrist.
 
A psychiatrist is an M.D., which makes them qualified to provide prescriptions. These professionals are also trained in how to provide psychotherapy, although more and more psychiatrists are opting to concentrate on the medical aspects of treatment, preferring to instead refer their patients to another mental health professional to address the psychological aspects of their illness.
 
Other physicians, such as your family doctor, may also prescribe psychiatric medications and this can be a good option for many, especially if your case is not complicated and responds well to treatment with an antidepressant.
 Seeing your personal physician is also a good idea in order to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, including certain medical illnesses like hypothyroidism and medication side effects. 
Both psychotherapy and medications are able to help people with depression; and, often, people will do well with just psychotherapy alone or with medications alone. Other times, a combination of both will give the best results. In cases where a person's depression has been difficult to treat or medications are not a good option, treatments such as ECT or TMS may provide better results.﻿﻿

If you have chronic depression, more than one factor may be causing your symptoms.﻿﻿ One of these potential causes is a deficiency in one or more essential nutrients. This could be great news, because along with medication, therapy, and any other treatment your doctor prescribes, making simple changes to your diet may help you to feel better.
 
Keep in mind that the body benefits most from vitamins and minerals that come from whole foods rather than pills. In fact, even if you aren't low in any particular nutrient, eating a balanced diet in general—one made up of fresh foods rather than processed ones—can help you feel better overall.﻿﻿
 Only a medical professional can determine if you have a nutritional deficiency, so before you fill your fridge with new foods or stock up on supplements, get an official diagnosis. 
B vitamins are essential for mental and emotional well-being. They're water-soluble, meaning they can't be stored in the body, so you need to get them through the foods you eat every day. B vitamins may be depleted by alcohol, refined sugars, nicotine, and caffeine. Excesses of any of these can play a part in a B-vitamin deficiency.
 
The brain uses vitamin B1 to help convert glucose, or blood sugar, into fuel. Without it, the brain rapidly runs out of energy.﻿﻿ Thiamine deficiencies are rare but can lead to a variety of disorders including irritability and symptoms of depression. One study found that thiamine supplements might help counteract the time lag of antidepressants for people with major depressive disorder.﻿﻿
 
Natural food sources of vitamin B1 include:﻿﻿
 If you have low levels of vitamin B1, you may want to avoid clams, milled rice, mussels, and shrimp. These foods contain the enzyme thiaminases, which renders thiamine inactive. 
A niacin deficiency can cause pellagra, a disease that can cause psychosis and dementia.﻿﻿ Because many commercial foods contain niacin, pellagra has virtually disappeared. However, deficiencies in vitamin B3 can produce agitation and anxiety, as well as mental and physical slowness.
 
Food sources of vitamin B3 include:﻿﻿
 
Deficiencies of vitamin B5 are rare but may lead to fatigue, depression, insomnia, skin irritation, and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of vitamin B5 include:
 
Vitamin B6 helps the body process amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins and some hormones. It is needed to make serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine. Many nutritionally oriented doctors believe that most diets do not provide optimal amounts of this vitamin.
 
Vitamin B6 deficiencies, although very rare, cause impaired immunity, skin lesions, and mental confusion.﻿﻿ A marginal deficiency sometimes occurs in people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, people with kidney failure, and women using oral contraceptives.
 
Food sources of vitamin B6 include:﻿﻿
 
A vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to a variety of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. Because vitamin B12 is important for red blood cell formation, a deficiency can also cause anemia.﻿﻿ Deficiencies take a long time to develop, since the body stores a three- to five-year supply in the liver.
 When shortages do occur, they are often due to a lack of intrinsic factor: an enzyme that allows vitamin B12 to be absorbed in the intestinal tract. 
This condition is known as pernicious anemia. Since intrinsic factor diminishes with age, older people are more prone to B12 deficiencies.
 
Food sources of vitamin B12 include:﻿﻿
 
Vitamin B9 is needed for DNA synthesis.﻿﻿ It is also necessary for the production of SAM (S-adenosyl methionine). A poor diet, illness, heavy alcohol use, and certain drugs can contribute to folate deficiencies. Pregnant women are often advised to take this vitamin to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus.
 
Food sources of folate include:﻿﻿
 
When too little vitamin C plays a role in depression symptoms, supplements may help. While there are currently more animal than human studies showing the effects of vitamin C on depression, one small study of young male students linked higher levels with an improved overall mood and lower levels with increased depression, anger, and confusion.﻿﻿
 Stress, pregnancy, and breastfeeding increase the body's need for vitamin C, while aspirin, tetracycline, and birth control pills can deplete the body's supply. 
Food sources of vitamin C include:﻿﻿
 
Vitamin D is important to the body in many ways. Your body needs this key vitamin to absorb calcium. What's more, your bones need it to stay healthy and strong, your cells need it to grow, your nerves need it to carry messages between the brain and other body parts, and your immune system needs it to fend off viruses and bacteria.
 
The “sunshine vitamin” also plays a role in mental health.
 More and more research has shed light on the link between a lack of vitamin D and depression. 
One meta-analysis found that people with depression have low vitamin D levels and people with low vitamin D have a much greater risk of depression.﻿﻿ While the best way to absorb vitamin D is through sun exposure, dietary supplements and certain foods are also viable sources. 
 
Food sources of vitamin D include:﻿﻿
 
Deficiencies in a number of minerals have been associated with depressive symptoms as well as physical problems.
 
The fourth most abundant mineral in the human body, magnesium is mostly stored in your bones.﻿﻿ While not common, magnesium deficiency can occur if you don't consume enough magnesium-rich foods.
 Health problems, like diabetes and moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, as well as certain medication that interferes with the absorption of magnesium in your small intestine, can also cause a deficiency. 
A deficiency of this essential mineral has been linked with personality changes, including apathy, depression, agitation, confusion, anxiety, and delirium.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of magnesium include:﻿﻿
 
Calcium, which is the most abundant mineral in the body, is mostly stored in the bones and teeth where it helps with formation and strength.﻿﻿ It also plays a role in muscle contraction, normal nervous system function, blood clotting, and hormonal secretion.
 Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density (osteopenia) or brittle, weak bones (osteoporosis). 
A diet low in calcium has also been shown to increase self-rated depression in middle-aged women.﻿﻿
 
Calcium deficiency can occur from a lack of calcium in your diet as well as an abundance of protein and sodium-rich foods, which are known to impair calcium absorption.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of calcium include:
 
Selenium is a trace mineral, which means that your body only needs a small amount. Selenium is essential for normal thyroid function, reproduction, and DNA synthesis. One study linked too high and too low levels of selenium in young people to an increased risk of symptoms of depression.﻿﻿
 
Selenium is often found in multivitamins as well as in the forms of selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast, or sodium selenite. It's still unknown how well the body absorbs selenium in supplement form.
 
Food sources of selenium include:﻿﻿
 
You need zinc for normal growth and a healthy immune system.﻿﻿ The trace mineral is involved in protein production, DNA synthesis, and cell division. It also helps with your sense of smell and taste.
 
Zinc deficiency, which is rare in children and young adults, may be due to diet as well as problems with absorption, which can be seen in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since zinc leaves the body quickly, you need to eat foods that contain zinc daily.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of zinc include:
 
Iron deficiency can impact anyone at any age. In fact, it's among the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world.﻿﻿
 Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, a protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to every part of your body, as well as myoglobin, which is found in your muscle cells. 
One study found that 72% of participants with depression had iron deficiency anemia (IDA) compared to 16% of non-depressed participants. Researchers also linked the severity of depression symptoms to an increase in IDA.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of iron include:﻿﻿
 
Although your body does not need much, this trace mineral is required for normal functioning of your brain, nervous system, and many of your body’s enzyme systems. A tiny amount (about 20mg) is stored in your bones, liver, pancreas, and kidneys, and you can also get it from food.﻿﻿
 People with manganese deficiency, which is extremely rare, often struggle with infertility, bone problems, altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and seizures. 
Research has linked both manganese deficiency and an over-abundance of the trace mineral to the development of depressive disorders.﻿﻿
 
Food sources of manganese include:﻿﻿
 
Your body requires potassium for optimum health, including proper kidney, heart, and brain function, muscle growth, and nerve transmission.
 
A deficiency in potassium can result from a low-carb diet and is also linked to certain conditions, including people with kidney disease, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease, and people who use laxatives or diuretics.﻿﻿
 
A recent study found that a diet low in potassium and high in sodium may predict future depression in adolescents.﻿﻿
 Getting potassium through your diet is preferred; talk to your health care provider before taking potassium supplements. 
Food sources of potassium include:
 
Nutrition is an important and often overlooked part of good mental health. Luckily, tweaking your diet to keep your body and mind healthy doesn't have to be complicated.﻿﻿
 
A nutritionist or dietitian is a great first step to determine if you are low in any of these vitamins and minerals. If you are, you can work together to find easy ways to incorporate more of them into your diet.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

"
When someone you care about is depressed, offering advice or wisdom may be something you do with only good intentions in mind. However, the words you use may not convey the message you want to send—especially if you don't understand the nature of depression and mental illness.
 
It's important to remember that depression is a medical condition that requires treatment, be it with medication, therapy, or both. When you're talking to a loved one about their depression, repeating platitudes can make someone feel that you're minimizing their feelings.
 
When you're expressing your own feelings, the phrases you use may seem clear and to the point from your perspective, but the person with depression who is on the receiving end may feel attacked, misunderstood, or deeply hurt.
 It's important to discuss mental health with people you care about, but if you don't use tact and compassion, your attempts to help may do more harm than good. Minimize their feelings Dismiss their symptoms Deny their feelings Compare their feelings to others Express apathy Call them selfish Tell them you care Ask how you can help Take care of tasks like chores or errands Offer to help them find help Express empathy and understanding Be supportive 
Avoid making comments like:
 
Having someone tell you to try harder when you are already giving it your best effort can be demoralizing and may make a person with depression feel their situation is hopeless.
 
There are many reasons depression develops and a person cannot necessarily control all of the risk factors involved. Once a person has become depressed, it's not a matter of just ""talking themselves out of"" a low mood.
 
Like diabetes or hypothyroidism, depression can happen because the body is not making enough of substances it needs to function properly.﻿﻿ A person with diabetes cannot will their body to make more insulin.
 A person experiencing depression due to low levels of neurotransmitters can't simply ""think"" themselves into having more. 
Similar to how people with diabetes might need treatment with insulin, people who have depression need medical intervention and support. For some people, this may mean taking medications that address chemical imbalances that can contribute to the condition.
 
Your well-meaning exhortations to ""cheer up"" or ""smile"" may feel friendly and supportive to you, but they oversimplify the feelings of sadness associated with depression.
 
Just as someone who is depressed can't force their brain to make more serotonin, they also can't just ""decide"" to be happy. While there are certainly benefits to practicing positive thinking,﻿﻿ it's not enough to cure someone of depression.
 
""People who need help often look like people who don't need help,"" said American author Glennon Doyle. In other words, how a person appears on the outside does not necessarily reflect how they feel on the inside. This is true of many mental illnesses, but also chronic illnesses and conditions that are sometimes deemed invisible. So avoid making statements like:
 
It's not uncommon for people with depression and anxiety to try very hard to ""put on a good face"" and hide how they really feel from others. These thoughts can become very intense and, in fact, are characteristic of depression itself—even though they don't reflect reality.
 
Some reasons people may try to hide what they are feeling:
 
Just because someone who is depressed tries to cover it up, it doesn't mean they want to be dismissed when they do choose to open up about how they really feel. It takes courage to speak openly about the pain they feel. If someone responds with doubt or disbelief, it may make them feel like talking about their depression is not safe.
 It can also make them doubt themselves. When paired with the stigma attached to mental illness, those feelings of doubt may make them reluctant to seek treatment.﻿﻿ 
When you're talking to a friend who is depressed or going through a difficult time, resist the temptation to compare pain. Remember that pain (emotional and physical) is not only subjective but relative.
 
Avoid comments like:
 
People with depression also lack the internal resources needed to cope with stress in an effective and healthy way.﻿﻿ To you, an event or situation that constitutes a minor annoyance or inconvenience may feel like an insurmountable obstacle to your loved one with depression.
 
People often worry if they don't see a clear ""reason"" for their depression, and not knowing why they are depressed can make matters worse. What someone's life looks like on the outside doesn't always reflect, or change, how they feel on the inside.
 
Depression doesn't need a justification. The experience is highly personal, and even if you care about someone and want to help, be aware that you can never know for sure how it feels to be them.
 Maybe a person's life could be worse, but depression isn't about how bad things are—it's about how bad they feel for that person at that moment. 
Avoid making comparisons or staging a ""competition"" for who feels the worst. Doing so isn't helpful and can make a person with depression feel that you're minimizing their experience or not really listening to what they're telling you.
 
While a deficiency of mood-regulating substances is technically occurring in the mind, the phrase ""all in your head"" tends to be dismissive. People who hear the phrase may also feel attacked, as though they are being accused of ""making it up"" or lying about how they feel. So avoid saying things such as:
 
Furthermore, depression very often is not just in someone's head but in their body as well. There are many physical symptoms of depression, including chronic pain, which are very real. Depression is a medical condition that can't be expected to improve without treatment.
 Depression is not a condition someone chooses to have, and while researchers don't understand all the potential causes, they know that there are many factors. 
Some of the key factors that contribute to depression include:
 
There are some modifiable risk factors and lifestyle changes that can have an impact on symptoms,﻿﻿ but simply recommending lifestyle changes they may not be prepared for can also be unhelpful. The symptoms of depression (such as fatigue and lack of motivation) can make mental and physical activity overwhelming and exhausting.
 
When someone is depressed, they may carry feelings of guilt and shame. They may feel that they are a burden to the people in their lives, and these feelings can make depression worse and may even lead to suicidal thoughts or self-harming behaviors.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Minimizing the pain of another person is not helpful. For people who are dealing with depression, it can be very hurtful and harmful.
 
When you're caring for (and about) someone who is depressed, you may say hurtful things when you are feeling frustrated or worried. If you find yourself thinking ""who cares?"" when you're listening to a loved one, recognize that it might be a sign you are burnt out.﻿﻿
 
You need to take care of your own emotional and mental health before you can help someone else with theirs. If you are feeling frustrated, irritated, or helpless, check-in with yourself and make sure that you have the support you need.
 
It may seem, at times, like someone who is depressed is very preoccupied with their own life (or, more specifically, their own thoughts) but that doesn't make them selfish. Avoiding making comments that shame them for how they are feeling such as:
 
Implying that a person with depression doesn't care about other people provides no comfort and only fuels feelings of blame, shame, and guilt. People who experience depression still care about others.
 
Even if you have experienced clinical depression yourself, your experience may be different from someone else's. If you've never had depression, it may be hard for you to empathize. In either case, if someone you love is depressed, the best thing you can do is be open and willing to learn.
 
Rather than giving up on a conversation by saying ""I just don't understand""—or saying you do understand when you really don't—start by reassuring your loved one that you care about them.﻿﻿
 If you are struggling to understand what they need, be honest. Calmly explain, then be patient and ready to listen. 
While this may be true, a person who is depressed may not have the perspective necessary to entertain the idea—let alone believe it. Platitudes, clichés, and vague statements don't offer much for someone to hold on to in terms of hope. So avoid making statements like:
 
A person who is depressed may have a hard time envisioning the future because they are overwhelmed by the present. It's also not easy to ""let go"" or ""escape from"" the past, especially for someone who experienced loss or trauma.
 
You may feel like you're offering hope by saying that, eventually, things will get better—but a person who is depressed may be frustrated wondering how long they will have to wait.
 Instead of pushing them to focus on the future or forget about the past: 
It's tough to find helpful words to someone who is feeling depressed. Don't be afraid to say, ""I am not sure what to say right now."" Stay mindful that the words you know can make a big difference. And if you're not careful, your words might do more harm than good.
 
If you think you've said something hurtful in the past, apologize. Explain that you weren't sure what to say or that you didn't understand. An apology can help someone begin feeling better if your words haven't been helpful in the past.
 Minimize their feelings Dismiss their symptoms Deny their feelings Compare their feelings to others Express apathy Call them selfish Tell them you care Ask how you can help Take care of tasks like chores or errands Offer to help them find help Express empathy and understanding Be supportive ""Snap out of it!"" ""Just try harder!"" ""But you don't look depressed!"" ""You don't seem sad!"" ""I haven't been acting any different."" They may be embarrassed, confused, guilty, ashamed, or afraid of what would happen if other people found out that they were depressed. They may worry that they will be seen as incompetent at work or as a parent. They may be worried that their spouse, family, and friends will stop loving them. ""It can't be that bad."" ""It could be worse."" ""You think you have it bad…"" ""It's all in your head."" ""It's your fault."" ""You're imagining things."" Genetics. Some environmental factors may also play a role, perhaps by triggering an underlying inherited vulnerability to depression. Environmental factors. As with genetics, people can't always control environmental triggers such as the type of home environment they grew up in. It's well known that people who experienced trauma or abuse in childhood are at an increased risk for depression later in life. Stress. Chronic daily stress, personal problems, and major life events can play a role in trigging symptoms of depression. ""You only think about yourself."" ""Other people have problems, too."" ""You're thinking about yourself too much."" ""This too shall pass."" ""Let it go."" ""You'll get over it."" Do your best to be present with them at the moment. Just sit with them and try not to worry about saying the right or wrong thing.

Psychotherapy is often called ""talk therapy"" because it involves an individual and a psychotherapist sitting in a room talking. But it is much more than that. Psychotherapists have training in a variety of techniques that they can employ to help people to recover from mental illness, resolve personal issues, and create desired changes in their lives.
 
Psychotherapy can be an effective treatment for depression because it can help you delve into possible underlying reasons for depression and learn new coping skills. Many of the therapeutic modalities described below have evidence supporting their benefit in treating depression.
 Several studies suggest, however, that the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy is the best approach, because of the biopsychosocial origins of most mood disorders. 
There are many different types of therapy that can be effective in treating depression. The kind that is right for you can depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of your symptoms, your own personal preferences, and your therapy goals.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
At the heart of cognitive therapy is the idea that our thoughts can affect our emotions. For example, if we choose to look for the silver lining in every experience, we will be more likely to feel good as opposed to if we only focus on the negative.
 
Negative thoughts can contribute to and exacerbate depression. It is hard to feel good when you are stuck in a constant loop of negative thoughts. Cognitive therapy helps people learn to identify common patterns of negative thinking (known as cognitive distortions) and to turn those negative thought patterns into more positive ones, thus improving mood.
 Cognitive therapy is usually short-term and goal-focused. Therapy sessions are structured with a specific plan for each session, and there is ""homework"" practice to do outside of therapy. Cognitive therapy usually lasts between six to 18 weeks. 
Where cognitive therapy is focused on the negative thoughts that contribute to depression, behavior therapy is centered on changing behaviors that affect emotions. One common focus of behavioral treatment for depression is behavioral activation. This entails helping patients engage in activities that will enhance their feelings of well-being.
 
Because cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy work well together to help depression and anxiety disorders, the two are often combined in an approach called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on addressing both the negative thought patterns and the behaviors that contribute to depression.
 
Your therapist may ask you to keep a journal to track the events of the week and any self-defeating and negative reactions to those events. Habitual negative responses to events (known as automatic negative reactions) are just one pattern of thinking you might address over the course of CBT. Other common response patterns include all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. 
 
Once you have learned how to identify this kind of response, you will work with your therapist to learn new thinking patterns and ways of responding. You might also practice positive self-talk.
 Like cognitive and behavioral therapy, CBT is usually brief and goal-oriented. It generally involves between five to 20 structured sessions centered around addressing specific concerns. 
CBT sessions are often accompanied by ""homework,"" which may include keeping a journal, practicing relaxation activities, completing readings, and using worksheets focused on specific goals. Research suggests that CBT can be effective in the treatment of depression and that it may have lasting effects that prevent future relapse of depressive symptoms.﻿﻿
 
Dialectical behavior therapy is a type of CBT. Its main goal is to teach people with depression the skills to cope with stress, regulate emotions, and improve relationships with others.﻿﻿
 
This type of psychotherapy also incorporates mindfulness practices from Buddhist traditions and the use of crisis coaching, in which an individual can call the therapist to receive guidance on how to handle difficult situations. As the person practices these new skills more and more, they will become better at handling these challenging situations on their own.
 The National Alliance on Mental Health states that DBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mental illnesses, including depression.  
Psychodynamic therapy, also known as psychoanalytic therapy, assumes that depression can occur because of unresolved—usually unconscious—conflicts, often originating from childhood. The goals of this type of therapy are for the patient to become more aware of their full range of emotions, including contradictory and troubling ones, and to help the patient more effectively bear these feelings and put them in a more useful perspective.
 
Unlike some of the other treatment approaches for depression, psychodynamic therapy tends to be less focused and longer-term. This approach can be useful for finding connections in past experiences and seeing how those events might contribute to feelings of depression. This approach can also be helpful for building self-awareness and increasing certain emotional capacities.
 
Interpersonal conflict and poor social support can also contribute to feelings of depression. Interpersonal therapy is a type of therapy that focuses on these issues by addressing past and present social roles and interpersonal interactions. During treatment, the therapist generally chooses one or two problem areas to focus on.
 
This type of therapy is usually brief and involves examining social relationships with important people in your life. This can include your relationships with your partner, friends, family, and co-workers. The goal is to identify the role these relationships play in your life and find ways of resolving conflicts. 
 
Your therapist might ask you to role-play different scenarios in order to practice and improve communication. By doing this, the hope is that you will be able to implement these strategies in your relationships and build a stronger social support system.
 
Psychotherapy can be delivered in a number of different ways. In some cases, your treatment may incorporate two or more forms, such as meeting individually with your therapist followed by the occasional group session where you can practice new skills. Common psychotherapy formats include:
 
Recommendations from others can often be the best way to find a good therapist. But in the end, it's up to you to decide whether or not the two of you click. It may be helpful to interview a new therapist and, if you feel that things are not working, to try a new one.
 Individual therapy: This modality involves one-on-one work between patient and therapist. It allows the patient to have the full attention of the therapist, but is limited in that it does not allow the therapist an opportunity to observe the patient within social or family relationships. Family therapy: This approach is most useful when it is necessary to work on dynamics within the family group. Family therapy can be especially helpful for children and teens.

In the United States, over 7% of adults and children (over the age of 12) experience depression within any two-week period.﻿﻿ In fact, depression is one of the most common chronic health conditions listed by doctors on their patients' medical records.
 
While depression is common, if you think you have it, you may be unsure about where to begin. Here are the steps to getting your mental health treated, so you can feel well.
 
If you suspect you may have depression, your first visit should be to your family doctor or primary care physician for a thorough checkup. While most doctors do screen for depression, it's best to tell your doctor your concerns about your mood.﻿﻿ Your doctor is there to help you, so don't hold back.
 
Your answers to these questions (and others) will help your doctor pinpoint whether or not you have major depressive disorder, often referred to simply as depression. Before confirming a diagnosis, however, your doctor will need to rule out other health problems.
 
Symptoms of several medical conditions can mimic those of depression. This is especially true in older adults with new-onset depression. These conditions include:﻿﻿
 
While blood tests cannot be used to diagnose depression, they can rule out some of these above conditions. Less commonly, your doctor may order an imaging test, like a brain MRI. This can rule out structural brain diseases, like stroke, especially if the doctor notices evidence of cognitive problems or neurological signs upon physical examination.
 Some medications may also cause symptoms of depression as a side effect. Be sure to tell your doctor all of the medications you are taking, including both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. 
Lastly, note that sometimes other mental health conditions can be difficult to tease apart from depression.﻿﻿ For instance, bipolar disorder may be misdiagnosed initially as depression.
 
Often this misdiagnosis occurs because symptoms of mania may be overlooked, as depressive symptoms are the ones that feel so bad and first prompt the doctor visit. Substance use, either intoxication or withdrawal, can also cause symptoms that overlap with depression. Try to remain patient as your doctor sorts through your symptoms.
 
If your doctor diagnoses you with depression, you may then be referred to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist.﻿﻿ The psychiatrist will further evaluate your mood and determine whether or not medication is needed. 
 Some people will do fine being treated by their primary care physician. Others may benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms are not improving with the first trial of an antidepressant or the depression is severe from the start. 
Research suggests that the combination of medication and therapy is most effective for treating depression. If you would benefit from psychotherapy, your psychiatrist may handle this as well, although some elect to refer patients to another mental health professional, like a psychologist.﻿﻿
 
It's important to note the treatment of depression is not as simple as receiving a prescription for an antidepressant. The individual causes of depression are diverse and poorly understood. The medications used to treat it are just as diverse, so matching a drug with an individual is not a clear-cut process.﻿﻿
 
When your doctor chooses your antidepressant, they will consider many factors to try to make this match. These include your specific symptoms, any co-existing illnesses you have, your tolerance of side effects, and any medications you have previously tried.﻿﻿
 
Treatment can take some time. While many people begin to feel better within one to two weeks, it can take six to twelve weeks to feel the full effect of your medication.
 
Be sure to communicate regularly with your doctor, especially if you are experiencing bothersome side effects. If you are noticing very little or no improvement in your symptoms after two to four weeks, your doctor may increase your dose, add another medication to increase its effect, or switch your medication.﻿﻿
 
Get our printable guide to help you ask the right questions at your next doctor's appointment. 
The most important thing to remember about seeking treatment for your depression symptoms is simply to speak up and ask. Depression is not a sign of weakness or laziness. It's a sign that something is out of balance. With proper treatment, which usually entails the two-pronged approach of medication and psychotherapy, you can feel well again.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. How long have you been feeling sad or down?

Depression chat rooms can help if you are feeling depressed and need to talk to someone who understands just what it is that you are going through. You can find a safe place to express yourself and get support from others who are also experiencing depression.﻿﻿
 
However, if you are feeling suicidal and in danger of hurting yourself, rather than going to a non-crisis chat room, you should seek assistance from your doctor, therapist, or a suicide hotline.
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
You can also text to 838255 during these times of crisis. These links are also appropriate for veterans (press 1 and you will be linked to counselors who have been trained in issues that you may be experiencing).
 
These organizations provide moderated chat rooms, which means a volunteer is present in the rooms to help make sure that all users are following site rules and treating each other respectfully. These rooms are not a substitute for professional treatment for depression, but you may find the community to be supportive.
 
Moderated chat rooms offer a safer place to express yourself compared with open social media platforms. However, they are not generally staffed by mental health professionals.﻿﻿ The volunteer moderators or hosts will try to maintain order, but they may not always be effective in preventing abusive behavior.
 
You may find the design and usability for some of the chat rooms to be better than others. Be sure to read the etiquette rules for the group, which might include guides on starting new topics, a list of topics that are off-limits, and whether it's OK to attach images or provide links.
 
You may also wish to explore whether there are health organizations in your area that offer a form of online intervention or treatment for depression. If you have a doctor or therapist who is treating you for depression, ask about options you have for online therapy. Chat rooms provide peer-to-peer support, but therapy (either online or in person) is important for the treatment of depression.
 
If you struggle with sharing your emotions, verbal communication via an online chat room might be easier for you. Another perk: anonymity. Some people find comfort in not having to express themselves face to face. This can be especially true if you struggle with depression as well as low self-esteem.
 There's a lot of solidarity when talking to people who are going through similar situations. Even if you have a supportive group of friends and family, they might not be able to fully understand what it feels like to live with depression.  
That said, these forums shouldn't replace your real-life support system. If you find yourself spending a lot of time online, in lieu of meeting up with friends and family, it may be a red flag that you're using these forums to replace face-to-face interactions.
 
While the majority of people on these online forums are there to help, it's impossible to know everyone's motivation, so you'll need to exercise caution to ensure your online relationships are healthy and genuine. Unfortunately, online predators who are looking to take advantage of those who are feeling vulnerable do exist. If someone is making you uncomfortable or ashamed of your depression, block or report the person to the moderator.
 While a depression forum is a great place to connect with others and share experiences, it cannot (and should not) replace seeing a professional. If you are experiencing severe depression, it is best to consult with your doctor or a mental health practitioner. 
Connecting with others who are going through what you are experiencing can be a positive step. Depression is a mood disorder that causes a constant feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It may require long-term treatment, but most people with depression feel better with medication, talk therapy, or both. Get the help that can further your journey out of depression.
 Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) offers peer-led online support groups and forums to give people living with depression and bipolar disorder a place to share experiences and coping skills and gain hope. Depression Chat Rooms from depression-chat-rooms.org aims to connect people who have issues regarding depression and anxiety. They also welcome people with similar or related health issues such as bipolar disorder and eating disorders. The website is independent, nonprofit, and free. Note that chat rooms on the site are moderated, while forums are not. Depression Forums has more than 70,000 members and offers forums on topics ranging from depression and anxiety to recovery and coping to medication and therapy that are moderated by volunteers.  Depression Sanctuary is a nonprofit organization created to provide a safe, moderated platform for people with depression to seek support from other like-minded people. Membership is required to participate in the Depression Sanctuary chat rooms, but it's completely free to join. They offer hosted chats at specific times. Be aware that to keep the support group a safe and comfortable place for all members, certain rules must be followed while in the chat rooms. Depression Sanctuary is staffed by volunteers who also live with depression. Be kind and treat them with the same respect and care that you'd want for yourself. Depression Understood offers a depression chat room that is always open. They aim to have a relaxed, supportive, and informal atmosphere. HealthUnlocked runs in partnership with the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) and offers a safe space for anxiety and depression support. ",depression chat room help feel depress need talk someone understand find safe place express get support others also experience depression however feel suicidal danger hurt rather non crisis chat room seek assistance doctor therapist suicide hotline suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database also text time crisis link also appropriate veterans press link counselors train issue may experience organizations provide moderate chat room mean volunteer present room help make sure users follow site rule treat respectfully room substitute professional treatment depression may find community supportive moderate chat room offer safer place express compare open social media platforms however generally staff mental health professionals volunteer moderators host try maintain order may always effective prevent abusive behavior may find design usability chat room better others sure read etiquette rule group might include guide start new topics list topics limit whether attach image provide link may also wish explore whether health organizations area offer form online intervention treatment depression doctor therapist treat depression ask options online therapy chat room provide peer peer support therapy either online person important treatment depression struggle share emotions verbal communication via online chat room might easier another perk anonymity people find comfort express face face especially true struggle depression well low self esteem lot solidarity talk people similar situations even supportive group friends family might able fully understand feel like live depression say forums replace real life support system find spend lot time online lieu meet friends family may red flag use forums replace face face interactions majority people online forums help impossible know everyone motivation need exercise caution ensure online relationships healthy genuine unfortunately online predators look take advantage feel vulnerable exist someone make uncomfortable ashamed depression block report person moderator depression forum great place connect others share experience replace see professional experience severe depression best consult doctor mental health practitioner connect others experience positive step depression mood disorder cause constant feel sadness loss interest may require long term treatment people depression feel better medication talk therapy get help journey depression depression bipolar support alliance dbsa offer peer lead online support group forums give people live depression bipolar disorder place share experience cop skills gain hope depression chat room depression chat room org aim connect people issue regard depression anxiety also welcome people similar relate health issue bipolar disorder eat disorder website independent nonprofit free note chat room site moderate forums depression forums members offer forums topics range depression anxiety recovery cop medication therapy moderate volunteer depression sanctuary nonprofit organization create provide safe moderate platform people depression seek support like mind people membership require participate depression sanctuary chat room completely free join offer host chat specific time aware keep support group safe comfortable place members certain rule must follow chat room depression sanctuary staff volunteer also live depression kind treat respect care want depression understand offer depression chat room always open aim relax supportive informal atmosphere healthunlocked run partnership anxiety depression association america adaa offer safe space anxiety depression support

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a well-known and accepted syndrome that can occur in people who abruptly discontinue Effexor (venlafaxine), a type of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used to treat depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.
 
Within a matter of hours of missing a dose, some people begin to experience symptoms of Effexor withdrawal.﻿﻿ Because of this, healthcare providers often recommend starting on the medication by building up from a low dose and decreasing the dosage when weaning from the drug. Still, symptoms of withdrawal can occur even if the medication is slowly tapered off.
 
Some people report experiencing ""brain shivers"" or “brain zaps” when they are late taking their prescribed dose of Effexor.﻿﻿ People often describe these sensations as a very brief, repetitive electric shock-like feeling that remains confined to the brain or head. Others report the sensation spreads out to other parts of the body. The sensation can be triggered by moving your eyes and is often accompanied by disorientation, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo, and/or lightheadedness.
 There is no current evidence that suggests that brain shivers or brain zaps represent any danger. However, these electric shock-like sensations can cause you to become alarmed or worry and happen frequently enough to disrupt daily life or quality of life. 
When decreasing or stopping an antidepressant, a neurochemical change takes place in the brain. As the brain readjusts to the new environment, symptoms of withdrawing from Effexor (or another antidepressant) may include:
 
Psychiatric or cognitive symptoms: 
 
Effexor withdrawal symptoms develop quickly, so if you are experiencing withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose, take it as soon as you remember.﻿﻿ If it is already close to the timing of your next scheduled dose, simply skip your missed dose and stick to your schedule. You can reduce your withdrawal symptoms by getting back on your prescribed dosing schedule as soon as possible.
 
While symptoms will typically go away in a few weeks, there are ways to make Effexor withdrawal more tolerable during that time. Here are a few steps to consider:
 
Some Effexor withdrawal symptoms can cause disorientation, which can be dangerous when driving or operating heavy machinery.﻿﻿
 
Although rare, stopping Effexor on your own can result in severe and frightening reactions. If you or someone you love experiences any of the following symptoms, call 911 or seek medical help right away:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you experience worsening anxiety or depression during withdrawal, and these symptoms last more than a month, it may mean you're having a relapse and need ongoing mental health treatment. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.
 
When you've decided to stop taking your antidepressant, it might be tempting to toss out your medication. Instead, take your time and work with your doctor to gradually decrease your dose over an extended period of time. How you'll do this will depend on several factors, including:
 
Sometimes, even if you are slow and deliberate when weaning off an antidepressant, you still may experience symptoms of discontinuation syndrome. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe fluoxetine, which has been found to help ease discontinuation symptoms.﻿﻿
 
In addition to teaming up with your doctor and asking a trusted family member or friend to help you through this period, you may find it helpful to reach out to others who are also going through Effexor withdrawal.
 The National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) both offer online discussion groups where you can connect with others who may share similar experiences. You may also be able to find groups on Facebook, in which members can offer each other tips and support. 
While Effexor withdrawal symptoms are rarely life-threatening, they can be uncomfortable and interfere with your daily life. The key to preventing withdrawal is to take your medication as prescribed and approach any dose changes under the close guidance of your doctor.
 Flu-like symptoms (fatigue, muscle pain, nausea) Headache Imbalance Nausea Sweating Restlessness High blood pressure Abnormal sensory disturbances Dizziness﻿﻿ Nightmares or excessive dreams Problems with concentration Anxiety or worsening of depression Confusion Narcolepsy (short-lived) Cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion) Psychosis﻿﻿ Team up with your doctor. They are your best ally when it comes to preventing and coping with symptoms of withdrawal. Discuss the benefits and risks of stopping Effexor and work together to figure out how (and when) to slowly stop taking the drug. Ask about OTC medications. Consult your doctor about any over-the-counter medications that can help ease Effexor withdrawal; for example, sleep aids, anti-nausea medications, and pain relievers. Consider psychotherapy. According to investigators at Harvard Medical School, undergoing psychotherapy while discontinuing an antidepressant can decrease your risk of having a relapse.﻿﻿ Seek support. Consider asking a close friend or family member for support and let them know what to expect as you work with your doctor to wean off the drug. Keep up with follow-ups. It’s important to keep in touch with your healthcare provider as you are weaning from the drug as well as after you’ve stopped altogether. Depending on how you feel, you may need to book ongoing monthly check-ins until discontinuation symptoms have eased and there are no signs of relapse. Practice self-care. As you are going through withdrawal, it’s more important than ever to exercise, eat healthfully, get regular sleep, and practice stress management.﻿﻿ These acts of self-care can help keep your mood stable as you taper off Effexor.  Delirium Suicidal feelings Psychosis﻿﻿ How long you've been taking the drug Your current dose (if you're on a low dose, you'll be able to taper off more quickly) Past experience with withdrawal symptoms Overall health",antidepressant discontinuation syndrome well know accept syndrome occur people abruptly discontinue effexor venlafaxine type serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri use treat depression anxiety panic disorder within matter hours miss dose people begin experience symptoms effexor withdrawal healthcare providers often recommend start medication build low dose decrease dosage wean drug still symptoms withdrawal occur even medication slowly taper people report experience brain shiver brain zap late take prescribe dose effexor people often describe sensations brief repetitive electric shock like feel remain confine brain head others report sensation spread part body sensation trigger move eye often accompany disorientation tinnitus ring ears vertigo lightheadedness current evidence suggest brain shiver brain zap represent danger however electric shock like sensations cause become alarm worry happen frequently enough disrupt daily life quality life decrease stop antidepressant neurochemical change take place brain brain readjust new environment symptoms withdraw effexor another antidepressant may include psychiatric cognitive symptoms effexor withdrawal symptoms develop quickly experience withdrawal symptoms miss dose take soon remember already close time next schedule dose simply skip miss dose stick schedule reduce withdrawal symptoms get back prescribe dose schedule soon possible symptoms typically away weeks ways make effexor withdrawal tolerable time step consider effexor withdrawal symptoms cause disorientation dangerous drive operate heavy machinery although rare stop effexor result severe frighten reactions someone love experience follow symptoms call seek medical help right away suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database experience worsen anxiety depression withdrawal symptoms last month may mean relapse need ongoing mental health treatment talk doctor concern decide stop take antidepressant might tempt toss medication instead take time work doctor gradually decrease dose extend period time depend several factor include sometimes even slow deliberate wean antidepressant still may experience symptoms discontinuation syndrome case doctor may prescribe fluoxetine find help ease discontinuation symptoms addition team doctor ask trust family member friend help period may find helpful reach others also effexor withdrawal national association mental illness nami anxiety depression association america adaa offer online discussion group connect others may share similar experience may also able find group facebook members offer tip support effexor withdrawal symptoms rarely life threaten uncomfortable interfere daily life key prevent withdrawal take medication prescribe approach dose change close guidance doctor flu like symptoms fatigue muscle pain nausea headache imbalance nausea sweat restlessness high blood pressure abnormal sensory disturbances dizziness nightmares excessive dream problems concentration anxiety worsen depression confusion narcolepsy short live cataplexy loss muscle tone trigger strong emotion psychosis team doctor best ally come prevent cop symptoms withdrawal discuss benefit risk stop effexor work together figure slowly stop take drug ask otc medications consult doctor counter medications help ease effexor withdrawal example sleep aid anti nausea medications pain relievers consider psychotherapy accord investigators harvard medical school undergo psychotherapy discontinue antidepressant decrease risk relapse seek support consider ask close friend family member support let know expect work doctor wean drug keep follow important keep touch healthcare provider wean drug well stop altogether depend feel may need book ongoing monthly check ins discontinuation symptoms ease sign relapse practice self care withdrawal important ever exercise eat healthfully get regular sleep practice stress management act self care help keep mood stable taper effexor delirium suicidal feel psychosis long take drug current dose low dose able taper quickly past experience withdrawal symptoms overall health

Is it really possible to be depressed and not know it? After all, depression is a serious clinical diagnosis. In reality, it can be difficult to recognize signs of depression over common experiences like sadness or grief.
 
Depression can appear suddenly or gradually. It can be related to a situation (as with adjustment disorders) or there may be no ""reason"" at all. You may be aware that you feel bad or not like your usual self, but you may not be aware that what you are feeling is clinically significant depression.
 
There are several possible explanations for being depressed and not knowing it. Depression might not be on your radar, either due to denial or stigma, or you may dismiss your symptoms because you've been experiencing them for so long. You may even be mistaking the symptoms of depression for something else.
 
The following are some reasons why you may not realize that you are depressed:
 
So how do you know if you are depressed? If you've been experiencing several of the following symptoms for at least two weeks then it is possible that you could be experiencing depression:﻿﻿
 
If you suspect that you may have depression—or things simply don't feel quite right—it is wise to speak with your doctor about what you are feeling. Your doctor can screen you for possible causes for your symptoms and get you the proper medical care that you need.﻿﻿
 
Get our printable guide to help you ask the right questions at your next doctor's appointment. 
As part of your doctor's visit, you may have certain blood tests done to rule out other causes of your depression symptoms. Certain conditions such as hypothyroidism can create symptoms that mimic depression.
 
There are a number of different treatment options available for depression. Your specific treatment plan will depend on your diagnosis and the severity of your symptoms.
 
Once other conditions have been ruled out and a depression diagnosis has been confirmed, your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant medication. There are several different types of antidepressants that can be effective for treating depression, including the following (in order of how commonly they are prescribed):
 
SSRIs are by far the most commonly prescribed, although SNRIs and atypical antidepressants are also often used. MOAIs and TCAs are less commonly used due to their side effects, but may still be used in some instances.
 
Your doctor may also refer you to a psychiatrist, psychotherapist, or another qualified mental health professional who specializes in treating mental health conditions.﻿﻿ Talk therapy or a technique known as cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful in the treatment of depression.
 
Whichever direction you take, remember that there is no stigma in getting help for depression. It is a serious and treatable condition—and one you don't have to manage alone.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. You've been depressed for a while. If you have been depressed for a long time, it simply feels normal to you. This may be especially true for those who have been depressed since early childhood. You don't feel sad. Because you may not be feeling particularly sad, you may think it can't possibly be depression. In reality, depression can take more forms than just a feeling of profound sadness. You may feel tired, low in energy, or lack in any real sense of joy without necessarily feeling sadness or being weepy.﻿﻿ Your symptoms have developed slowly. Depression can develop gradually over an extended period of time. When the changes in mood are subtle and come on slowly, you may not recognize that things aren't the same as they used to be.﻿﻿ You feel down about yourself. If you are feeling like you are somehow bad or defective, it's easy to dismiss what you are feeling as somehow being an innate part of yourself that can't be fixed. You may feel that rather than struggling with a treatable illness, you are irreparably broken and unworthy of feeling better.﻿﻿ You have internalized attitudes about mental health. Cultural differences can also make it more difficult to recognize and acknowledge depression. If those around you treat depression as something that must be borne without complaint, then you may feel as if asking for help is a sign of weakness.﻿﻿ Anger and irritability Anxiety and agitation Changes in appetite or weight (can be either a lack of appetite accompanied by weight loss or increased appetite with weight gain) Fatigue or lack of energy Feelings of sadness or emptiness Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or excessive guilt Loss of interest in activities usually enjoyed Mysterious aches and pains with no discernible cause Problems with thinking, memory, concentration, and decision making Sleep problems such as insomnia or sleeping too much Slowed thought, speech, or physical movements Thoughts of death and suicide Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Atypical antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Individual therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can provide a safe and supportive environment for you to explore what's behind your depression and how to work through your sadness.

The pain of an ended relationship is one that many people experience, maybe even more than once in a lifetime. Movies and books make it seem easy to bounce back after a broken heart: The happy endings either see a couple getting back together or someone moving on to an even better relationship. 
 
In real life, relationship woes aren’t usually resolved in two hours like they are on the silver screen, and the stories don’t always have tidy endings. 
 
If you’re trying to come to terms with the end of a relationship, commonly repeated platitudes, adages, and cliches are not likely to be helpful.﻿﻿ Although people may mean well when they say, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,” offering such sentiments doesn’t give you much by way of practical advice for coping with your emotions. 
 Healing from heartbreak is not the same process for everyone. It may even vary within the same person throughout their life, changing from one relationship to the next.  
Nobody can tell you with any degree of certainty how long you will need to heal, but there are some ways you can make the process of mending a broken heart into an opportunity to learn more about your wants and needs. 
 
Ultimately, you can use these insights to develop and strengthen your healthy coping skills. The growth you experience will help you navigate future relationships with others, as well as the relationship you have with yourself. 
 
In the immediate aftermath of a breakup, know that it’s OK to allow yourself time to grieve the loss. You don’t need to jump straight into problem-solving mode—in fact, doing so when you haven’t allowed yourself to fully embody your feelings may make the process more protracted and difficult. 
 
In the early days, try to resist the urge to isolate yourself. Sadness, guilt, confusion, and other intense feelings may be overwhelming. Reach out to the people who care about you. To come to terms with the changes in your life, you’ll need the support of your family and friends. 
 
When you’re ready for the next step, here are some do's and don’ts to help guide you through the process of healing. 
 
Try not to view the end of a relationship as a failure. Instead, think of it as an opportunity to learn and grow.﻿﻿ It doesn’t matter if it was your first relationship or if you’ve had others before. Everyone, whether they’re 15 or 50, can get to know themselves better and work on improving their relationship skills. 
 
You may have a lot of anger around the relationship, including the way it ended. You may even be tempted to “exact revenge” on your ex or fantasize about interfering in or disrupting their life—including new relationships. 
 
Remember that hurting another person won’t lessen your pain. In fact, it’s more likely to make you feel worse and will slow the progress of your own healing. 
 
Good self-care is emotional, physical, and spiritual. You have your own unique needs in each area, but there are some general acts of self-care that are beneficial for almost everyone such as a nutritious diet, regular exercise, a social support system, and strategies for coping with stress, to name a few.
 
Try to be patient, gentle, kind, and giving toward yourself. It may help to know that the pain of a break-up is not just emotional; research has shown people can also feel physical pangs of loss.﻿﻿
 
You may also need to work on restoring the “big picture” perspective. When you’re in a romantic relationship it may be a central part of your life, but romantic love isn’t the only kind that can be nourishing. Continue to nurture relationships with friends, family, and yourself.
 
If you feel guilt or shame about your role in a relationship that has ended, it may be hard to be a good friend to yourself as you work through these feelings. Keep in mind that practicing compassion toward yourself makes it more likely you’ll attract that kind of energy from others. 
 If you find you cannot let go of a relationship or feel you are unable to cope with the loss (even with support from friends and family) as time goes on, you may want to seek counseling.  
Working with a trustworthy, knowledgeable, skilled, and compassionate therapist is good self-care during any period of major change in your life, but can be especially helpful when you’re coping with loss.
 
We all have the tendency to look back on our lives, or certain relationships, with “rose-colored glasses.” The effect of “rosy retrospection” is that you may refuse to see the problems and only focus on the good parts (which you’re likely to miss).﻿﻿ 
 
Sometimes, both the good and bad memories may feel as though they’re playing on an endless loop in your mind. These intrusive thoughts can slow down the process of healing and can be quite distressing.﻿﻿ 
 
Though it may be difficult, try not to lose perspective. No relationship is all bad, but none are perfect either. If you are glorifying the relationship or find you continue to put your ex on a pedestal, it may be a sign that you need to give yourself some emotional and perhaps physical distance.﻿﻿
 
For example, you may struggle in the digital age to refrain from “checking up” on your ex via social media.﻿﻿ If you can’t resist the temptation, it may be time to unfriend them or block their profile. 
 
You won’t be able to move on with your own healing if you’re constantly being drawn back into their lives and thinking about what once was, as well as what will never be.﻿﻿ 
 
If your ex starts a new relationship, seeing them post on social media (even if it’s not always an accurate representation of reality) may cause old feelings to resurface for you. It can also fuel preoccupation with any unresolved aspects of your relationship with them. 
 
Even if your relationship ended on a sour note, chances are it was not all bad. It’s normal to look back at what was good about it and you may find you miss certain things about your ex and the love you shared.﻿﻿
 
At the same time, you may feel overwhelmed by the empty space that’s left when the relationship ends or harbor resentment about what happened that lead to its dissolution. 
 
Riding out these shifts in emotions is part of the healing process. When a happy memory comes up, allow yourself to be grateful for it—then move on.
 
Being honest with yourself about your needs (especially those that aren’t being met) can be a painful process. You may feel it would be easier, and less painful, to simply ignore them. ﻿﻿
 
While it may feel better in the short term to “numb” yourself to the hurt, it will only make it harder for you to heal in the long term. Pretending you don’t have needs makes it impossible for you to grow, both in your relationships with others and the one you have with yourself. 
 
Following a break-up is a good time to think about your wants and needs in a romantic relationship. You may find it helpful to journal or make lists. 
 Ask yourself questions like, “Have I been choosing partners who are not capable of a loving and mature relationship?” and “Was I hoping this person would change, or that I would be able to change them?”  
It can be painful to admit that your previous relationship wasn’t able to meet your needs. Taking the time to honestly reflect can be hard work, but once you do, you’ll be able to clarify the qualities to look for in a future partner. 
 
You may feel a sense of urgency about finding a new romantic partner, but so-called “rebound” relationships prevent you from working through your previous one.﻿﻿
 
If you don’t take time to reflect on a relationship that has recently ended, you may end up repeating patterns or making the same mistakes in a new one.
 
It can be hard to break free from old ways of thinking and behaving, even if you know it’s not helpful. But recognition is the first step to making changes. 
 
Sometimes, people have a hard time coping with being single when they had become used to being part of a couple.﻿﻿ This may be especially true after a long-term relationship ends. 
 If you’re struggling with your identity as a single person,﻿﻿ try to remember that your value comes from who you are, not who you're with.  
Being on your own gives you the opportunity to focus on yourself—though this can be hard if you are used to taking care of others and generally find it easier than thinking about your own needs. 
 
Sometimes, people who aren't as confident socializing on their own are more comfortable in social situations when they're part of a couple. Others may enjoy being social whether they’re in a relationship or not, but they might resist going out after a break-up.
 
The tendency to avoid social situations is often a mix of worrying about seeing an ex-partner or someone you know who might ask about the relationship combined with wanting to avoid places, activities, and people who would remind you of an ex.
 
Try not to isolate yourself. You certainly don’t have to go out on Friday night if you’d rather stay at home with a book, but if you do feel like spending time around others and just don't want to go out on your own, ask a friend to tag along. 
 
While you don’t have to rush it, you may begin to open up to the possibility of another relationship as time goes on.
 
It might be scary to think about falling in love again—especially after you’ve been hurt—but try to remember that as deep as the pain of a broken heart can be, it means that you experienced love just as deeply.
 
You may not even be looking for a relationship when love finds you, as it can show up in unexpected places. If you are looking more intentionally, be open to meeting others when you go out and choose the places and activities you enjoy.
 
Whether a church group, sports team, or the local library, you’re more likely to make positive connections with others and find lasting relationships (friends and romantic partners alike) in places where you feel safe and comfortable being yourself. 
 
Forgiving your ex may take time and may not come easily, especially if you were hurt or betrayed. It's important to note that forgiving someone does not mean that you condone their hurtful behavior and actions.
 
In fact, sometimes, the act of forgiveness is not so much about the other person. Arriving at a place of forgiveness gives you permission to stop investing time and energy into a person and situation that is no longer healthy for you.
 
To mend a broken heart and move on, there's someone else you need to be ready to forgive: yourself. 
 
You may find it easier to forgive your ex, but remember that the longest-running and the most powerful relationship you’ll ever have is with yourself.
 
You can't change the past, but you can learn from it. Whether you’re single or in a relationship, you can always change behaviors or shift your paradigm to prevent repeating mistakes, allow yourself to grow, and continue to develop self-love.

"If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you're experiencing severe depression symptoms, having thoughts of harming yourself or others, or your treatment just isn't helping, you may consider checking yourself into a hospital. Although this can be a frightening thought, you may find it less intimidating if you know what to expect from the process.
 
You may choose to be hospitalized if you're having symptoms that are putting you or others at risks, including:
 
Hospitalization can also be helpful if you're finding yourself too ill to eat, bathe, or sleep properly. In addition, your doctor may recommend hospitalization when you're making major changes in your treatment plan that require close supervision.
 Hospitalization is appropriate any time you need a safe place in which to receive intensive treatment until your symptoms stabilize. 
Because you're probably feeling overwhelmed right now, you may want to ask a friend or family member to help you through the process of checking into the hospital and filling out paperwork.
 
If possible, you or they should call ahead of time to find out about the hospital's rules and procedures and ask about what items you should bring with you. Information about visiting hours and telephone access will also be helpful.
 Even though you may have been hospitalized of your own free will, the hospital will set rules to ensure your safety, including: 
One of the first things that will happen is that you will be evaluated by a psychiatrist in order to determine an appropriate treatment plan to meet your specific needs.
 
Your treatment plan will probably involve work with a variety of mental health professionals, including:
 
You will most likely participate in individual therapy, group therapy, or family therapy during your stay. In addition, you will probably receive one or more psychiatric medicines.﻿﻿
 
Hospital staff will also take care of getting approval for your stay from your insurance provider. Your insurance company will periodically evaluate your progress during your stay to determine if you need additional time in the hospital.
 In the event that you are denied by your insurance company, you and your psychiatrist may appeal. 
Note that the criteria and rules surrounding voluntary hospitalization (you check yourself in) differ greatly from involuntary hospitalization (someone else checks you in). In the case that you sign yourself into a hospital, you also have the right to sign yourself back out.﻿﻿
 
The exception to this rule, however, is if the hospital staff believes you are a danger to yourself or others. If you are not a danger to anyone, the hospital must release you within two to seven days of your formal request, depending on the laws in your particular state.﻿﻿
 If you experience any problems with getting the hospital to release you, you should contact your state's protection and advocacy agency. 
While you are at the hospital, you also have the right to...
 
With the exception of your insurance company, no one will be told about your hospitalization without your permission.﻿﻿
 
After you are discharged from the hospital, your doctor may recommend a day-treatment program. This type of program will provide you with many of the benefits that you received during your hospitalization, such as psychotherapy and other services, but you may return home at night and on the weekends.
 
Treatment for depression doesn't end with hospitalization. Steps that you can take to ensure your continued recovery include:﻿﻿
 
Because depression tends to be a chronic illness, it's wise to have a plan of action should you ever need to be hospitalized again. This plan should include the following:
 
You may also have an advance directive and medical power of attorney prepared for you if you wish to give a trusted person the authority to act on your behalf in making medical decisions.﻿﻿ This will ensure that your will is carried out should you become too ill to make your own decisions.

If you like music, you probably already know it can affect your mood. Maybe you put on your favorite song to pump yourself up for an important meeting or listen to soothing music when you’re relaxing at home before bed.  
 
Research has demonstrated the benefits of music therapy for people with depression and anxiety.﻿﻿ While music therapy is often used to promote mental and emotional health, it may also improve the quality of life for people with physical health problems.  
 
A music therapy session may incorporate different elements, such as making music, writing songs, or listening to music. Music therapists are trained in more than music; their education often covers a wide range of clinical skills, including communication, cognitive neuroscience, psychological disorders, as well as chronic illness and pain management.  
 To practice music therapy, a person must take and pass an exam to become board certified. Credentialed professionals are listed on the National Music Therapy Registry.   
When you begin working with a music therapist, you will start by identifying what your goals are. For example, if you have depression and feel ""down and out"" most days, you may hope to use music to naturally lift your mood. You may also want to try applying music therapy to other symptoms of depression like anxiety, insomnia, or trouble focusing.  
 
After discussing your needs, a music therapist's goals for your treatment might include: 
 
Depending on your goals, a typical music therapy session lasts between 30 minutes to one hour. Much like you would plan sessions with a psychotherapist, you may choose to have a set schedule for music therapy—say, once a week. Or, you may choose to work with a music therapist on a more casual “as-needed” basis.  
 
Music therapy is often one-on-one, but you may also choose to participate in group sessions if they are available. Sessions with a music therapist take place wherever they practice, which might be a private office, clinic, or community health center. Wherever it happens to be, the room you work in together will be a calm environment with no outside distractions.  
 
Each music therapist will have their own routine for sessions. For example, some therapists like to start and end sessions the same way each time, perhaps with a particular song. Therapists can use many different styles and techniques depending on their education, interests, and strengths.  
 
For instance, some types of music therapy use a lot of movement. If you have physical pain or illness, it’s important to ask your music therapist about the techniques they use to make sure they will be a good fit for you.  
 
During a music therapy session, you may listen to different genres of music, play a musical instrument, or even compose your own songs. You may be asked to tune in to your emotions as you perform these tasks or allow your feelings to direct your actions. For example, if you are angry you might play or sing loud, fast, and dissonant chords.  
 
In addition to using music to express your feelings without words, you may also explore ways to change how you feel with music. If you express anger or stress, your music therapist might respond by having you listen to or create music with slow, soft, soothing tones.  
 
You may notice that switching to calm music makes you feel calm—and there’s a scientific explanation. Several studies have shown that heart rate and blood pressure readings respond to changes in volume and tempo.﻿﻿ Some research has suggested that listening to music also releases endorphins, which may help people manage pain.  
 
Between sessions, your music therapist may give you shorter exercises to do at home. They may recommend using apps on your smartphone to play music, generate sounds, and track your progress.  
 
Music and sound therapy have several subtle but important differences. Each type has its own goals, protocols, tools, and settings. Music therapy is also a relatively new discipline compared to the concept of sound healing, which is based on ancient Tibetan cultural practices.  
 
Rather than making or listening to music to address symptoms like stress and pain, sound therapy is more focused on using tools to achieve specific sound frequencies. Drums, flutes, chimes, bells, tuning forks, and natural sounds such as running water are used to produce tones, vibrations, and pitches that reach a specific frequency.
 The two types of therapy have some similarities and people may benefit from both, but there is less research on the effectiveness of sound healing compared to traditional music therapy.  
It's also important to note that those who practice and offer sound healing don’t necessarily have the same education, training, and credentialing as music therapists. The training and certifications that exist for sound therapy are not as standardized as those for music therapists.  
 
Another difference is where you’re most likely to encounter each type. While sound healing is often a component of complementary or alternative medicine, a music therapist is more likely to work in a hospital, substance abuse treatment center, or have a private practice. 
 
If you don’t consider yourself musical, that’s OK. You don't need any musical ability or previous experience to benefit from music therapy. 
 
Music therapy can be highly personalized, making it suitable for people of any age. Even very young children can benefit from music therapy. In fact, you'd likely recognize the foundations and techniques in most preschool classrooms.﻿﻿  
 
Children and young adults who have developmental and/or learning disabilities can use music therapy to strengthen motor skills and learn to communicate more effectively. ﻿﻿ 
 
Adults may find music therapy useful for everything from simple stress management to treating mental and physical illness.  
 
Older adults may have much to gain from music therapy in a group setting where it can fulfill social needs as well as promote physical and mental well-being.﻿﻿  
 
Research has also shown that music can have a powerful effect on people with dementia and other memory-related disorders.﻿﻿
 
The uses and benefits of music therapy have been researched for decades. Key findings from clinical studies have shown that music therapy may be helpful for people with depression and anxiety, sleep disorders, and even cancer. 
 
A systemic review published in 2017 found that studies have shown music therapy can be an effective component of depression treatment.﻿﻿ According to the research cited, the use of music therapy was most beneficial to people with depression when it was combined with the usual treatments (such as antidepressants and psychotherapy).  
 
A small study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2015 indicated that when used in combination with other forms of treatment, music therapy may help reduce obsessive thoughts, depression, and anxiety in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder.﻿﻿
 
In 2016, researchers conducted a feasibility study that explored how music therapy could be combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat depression.﻿﻿ While additional research is needed, the initial results were promising. The self-help group concept, which researchers named Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Music Therapy (CBT-Music), may prove to be an effective option for treating mild-to-moderate depression symptoms.
 
Many people find that music, or even white noise, helps them fall asleep.﻿﻿ Research has shown that music therapy may be helpful for people with sleep disorders or insomnia as a symptom of depression.﻿﻿  
 
Compared to pharmaceutical and other commonly prescribed treatments for sleep disorders, music is less invasive, more affordable, and something a person can do on their own to self-manage.  
 
Specific techniques like music-assisted relaxation therapy have been shown to benefit people with sleep difficulties by creating a relaxing “pre-sleep” state.﻿﻿ It can also be used in a non-home setting: Studies have shown that music can be a nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia in hospitalized patients.﻿﻿  
 
Music has been explored as a potential strategy for acute and chronic pain management in all age groups. Research has shown that listening to music when healing from surgery or an injury, for example, may help both kids and adults cope with physical pain.﻿﻿
 
Post-Surgical Pain
 
A 2015 study published in the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine found that when paired with standard post-operative hospital care, music therapy was an effective way to lower pain levels, anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure readings in patients who were recovering from thoracic surgery.﻿﻿
 
Non-pharmacological distraction techniques are often preferred methods of treating pain in children. Many studies have indicated that music therapy can be a valuable tool within this arsenal of treatments. In fact, some research has even shown music may affect children's behavior even if they aren't consciously aware of it.﻿﻿
 
A Scandinavian study published in 2017 found that children and teens who listened to music with headphones during minor surgical procedures showed fewer post-surgical maladaptive behaviors (which are scored using a special questionnaire) for up to a week after surgery.﻿﻿
 
Labor, Childbirth, and Newborn Testing
 
Music has also long been a popular pain management strategy during labor and childbirth. A 2019 review of literature conducted by Sydney Mohr at Lesley University found that even though the research is limited, music therapy assisted childbirth appears to be a positive, accessible, non-pharmacological option for pain management with benefits for laboring mothers and newborns.﻿﻿
 
Newborns might also benefit from music therapy, especially during the common tests performed after birth. One study found that when music was added to standard neonatal pain management during heel prick blood tests, the premature infants' facial expressions and vitals (taken to be indicators of pain) were noticeably different.﻿﻿
 
The premature babies who were exposed to music had lower heart rates and different facial expressions (believed to be indicative of pain). These changes were monitored during the test as well as for five minutes after it was complete. The researchers concluded that music could be a valuable addition to pain management in neonatal intensive care units, similar to how it can be used with older children and adults.
 
Chronic Pain
 
On an emotional pain level, music therapy can be part of a long-term plan for managing chronic pain. Music's strong connection to memory processing﻿﻿ means it can also help people recapture and focus on positive memories from when they did not have distressing symptoms.﻿﻿  
 
Coping with a cancer diagnosis as well as going through treatment is as much an emotional experience as a physical one. In the same way cancer patients often need more than one type of treatment to address their complex medical needs, they also need different sources of support to take care of their emotional and spiritual well-being.  
 
Music therapy has been shown to help reduce anxiety in cancer patients starting radiation treatments and may help them cope with the side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea.﻿﻿  
 
The emotional benefits of music therapy experienced by people with depression often apply to people with cancer as well, many of whom may experience symptoms of depression at some point after receiving a diagnosis, while they are undergoing treatment, or even once they are in remission.  ﻿﻿
 
Researchers are also exploring the potential of music therapy to help people of all ages with physical and mental health conditions, including:
 
On its own, music therapy has not been shown to constitute adequate treatment for medical conditions, including mental health disorders. However, when combined with medication, psychotherapy, and other interventions, it can be a valuable component of a treatment plan. 
 
If you’d like to explore music therapy, talk to your doctor or therapist. They can connect you with practitioners in your community. You'll also want to check your health insurance benefits. Music therapy sessions may be covered or reimbursable under your plan, but you may need a referral from your doctor.

"If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If someone you love has depression, you may wonder how you can help. You may even experience a range of difficult feelings of your own, such as worry, disappointment, and anger.
 
If you live with someone who is depressed and see their day-to-day life, you may be confused and even afraid at times. And if you have never been depressed yourself, you might have a hard time imagining what it feels like. You may not know much about the causes of depression, how it's diagnosed, or what treatment options are available.
 
There are many steps you can take to educate yourself about your loved one's experience with depression, but you also need to take care of your own mental health and well-being. Below are 10 things you can do to help someone you love who has depression.
 
While every person's experience with depression is unique (as is the experience of supporting someone who is depressed) here are a few ideas to start with.
 
You won't be able to support someone else if you are feeling overwhelmed and depleted yourself. Periodically take some time to step back from the situation and recharge your batteries.
 
While you can't ""catch"" depression the way you would a cold or the flu, the shared genetic and environmental influences may make it more likely that people who live together or are members of the same family will become depressed.
 
Depression can be demanding both for the person experiencing it and those who care about them. Remember that your feelings are a valid response to what can be, at times, a challenging situation to navigate.
 
You may find it helpful to find a caretaker support group, talk with a close friend, or see a counselor. The important thing is to vent your frustrations rather than allowing them to build up.
 
There are trusted resources on the internet that provide facts about depression, including symptoms and treatment. Reading up on what depression can feel like as well as the myths, misconceptions, and stigma around mental illness, can help you better understand your loved one's experience.
 
You should also learn about the other aspects of living with depression, such as informed consent and the legal rights of people seeking treatment. You may also want to inform yourself and your loved one about the relevant disability laws in your state for people who have a mental illness.
 
Sometimes, the most helpful thing you can offer to someone going through a hard time is your presence. Just providing a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on can be very comforting. Be patient and let your loved one know you are there for them.
 
You may decide to share what you've learned about depression in your research, but the most important thing you can tell them is that you understand depression is not their fault and that they are not lazy, weak, or worthless.
 
Depression can impair a person's social skills as well as make them feel less like being around others. They may become withdrawn, shy, sullen, and angry.﻿﻿
 
While it can be hard to be on the receiving end of an outburst, when someone who is depressed lashes out in anger, keep in mind that it may not be related to you at all—you might have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 
When your loved one pulls away from you, it can be very difficult not to take it personally—especially if you are in a romantic relationship. If your partner doesn't feel like having sex, you may feel rejected or worry they don't love you anymore.
 
Try to keep in mind that loss of sex drive is a classic symptom of depression. Sexual dysfunction can also be a side effect of the medications used to treat it.﻿﻿
 
If someone you love is depressed and no longer able to do the activities they used to, including working or helping around the house, you may feel like they are lazy. When you get frustrated, try to remember that someone who is depressed isn't lazy—they're ill.﻿﻿ Everyday activities like cleaning the house, paying bills, or feeding the dog may seem overwhelming, if not impossible, to someone who is depressed.
 
If your loved one's responsibilities around the house are piling up, you may not be able to take them on yourself.
 In addition to resisting the urge to blame your loved one, try not to blame yourself either. Know that it's OK if you need to ask for help. 
Many people with depression take medication, if not several. One practical way you can help them is by educating yourself on how the medication works, what the side effects are, and knowing signs to look for that would indicate the treatment is not working or that your loved one has stopped taking a medication (i.e., withdrawal symptoms).
 
You can also help them remember to refill prescriptions, keep their pills organized, make sure they are taking their medication as prescribed, and reassuring them that they are not ""crazy"" for needing to take it.
 
Offer your loved one hope in whatever form they are able to accept it. It may be a faith in God or another kind of higher power, their children or pets, or anything in their life that makes them want to keep living.
 Know what matters to your loved one and find ways to remind them of it when they feel down and hopeless. Be sure to remind yourself of these things, too. 
If someone with depression is showing signs of suicidal ideation, self-harming, or you are worried they are planning to attempt suicide, they need immediate help.
 
For your loved one's safety, know the warning signs that could indicate they are suicidal, such as:
 
People who are depressed often feel a deep sense of guilt. They may believe that they are a burden to those around them. Sometimes, they even begin to feel that their loved ones would be ""better off"" with them.
 
One of the ways you can combat these feelings is by regularly showing and telling them that you love them unconditionally. When you become discouraged or angry, it's important to reassure them that you are frustrated with their illness, not them.
 When you care about someone with depression and are trying to find the best way to help, it's essential that you have some support yourself. Whether it comes from other people in your life or a support group for caregivers, taking care of yourself not only strengthens your ability to help your loved one but also sets a positive example of good self-care.

For those who are grieving a loss, the holidays can be a particularly difficult time. Other notable times such as birthdays and anniversaries can also be painful when coping with loss. Gathering together with friends and family only emphasizes the absence of a deceased loved one. However, there are some things you can do to help yourself or a loved one through this difficult time.
 
If you have never experienced the loss of a loved one, it may be difficult to understand exactly what the grieving person is going through. The first step to comforting a loved one is to understand what they are going through.
 Grief is a process made up of five distinct stages. These stages can occur before or after the death has occurred and will apply to both the person who is dying and those who love them. 
All people are unique in their grieving process, but the stages often look something like the following.
 
A person in this stage talks about the future, avoids talking about the illness, blames the doctor for the illness, claims that the test results are wrong, and may avoid family and friends who want to talk about these matters.
 
The anger stage typically occurs when the person has come to terms with the fact that they or a loved is actually dying. This person begins to ask ""Why me?"" They may question their faith or religious beliefs. They may accuse family members or friends of uncaring attitudes.
 
At this stage, a person has vented all their anger and now tries to make a deal with God or higher power that if they change their lives or fulfill some other promise they will be allowed to live or to live long enough to complete some special task.
 
At this stage, the person realizes that death will be inevitable. If the person has already died, this is when the reality of death has begun to sink in for loved ones. There are two types of depression that can occur during this stage. Depression may be due to the change of circumstances (financial, family role, intimacy, independence) or it may be due to the loss itself. This stage is what is referred to as Holiday Blues when it occurs around the holidays.
 
For the person who is dying, acceptance may be exhibited as a decrease in interest in worldly events, a desire to be left alone, a decreased desire for communication, and an increase in detachment from loved ones. For the survivors, this will be a time when healing begins.
 
When helping support a friend or loved one through their grief, be prepared to listen, reassure, and make yourself available.
 
Your friend may need to talk about what has happened, their feelings about it, or just to reminisce about their lost loved one. Don't try to force your loved one to discuss things that they are not ready or willing to share. Just be a good listener and try to show that you care.
 
It's very common for a person to feel guilty, perhaps feeling that they could have done more. Let them know that they did what they could. People may also experience survivor's guilt. Remind them that they are loved and look for ways to focus on things other than the loss.
 
This is especially true immediately after the death and during holidays and other special events when the loss is most keenly felt. Grief and depression can cause people to withdraw, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Even doing small things like calling, texting, or dropping by for a quick visit can show that you are there to offer support whenever your loved one is able to accept it.
 
Depending on the situation, a grieving person may feel too overwhelmed with emotion to do even simple tasks; they may be having to deal with funeral arrangements or medical care. They may be having to take up the slack for a spouse who is no longer around to help them. Ask what tasks they may need help with around the house. Prepare a meal, volunteer to make phone calls, or offer to drive your friend to appointments.
 Practical assistance such as organizing meals, babysitting, and bringing in groceries can be very helpful when a person is grieving. 
If a loved one refuses to accept your invitations to dinner or other social events, be patient and keep asking. They will be ready in time, and you will be there when they are.
 
The grieving person may be angry and upset and take their anger out on you. Understand that they are going through a difficult time and don't hold it against them. Just keep offering steady, unconditional support. In time, your loved one will move onto other stages of grief and will be better able to handle feelings of anger and distress.
 
Write letters, send sympathy cards or flowers, or call periodically. The person who is grieving may not always be able to convey how much these gestures mean, but reaching out is a great way to show your love and support.
 
Helping someone you love through their grief also means knowing what not to do. Even people with the best intentions can make the following missteps.
 
Don't avoid your friend, even if you feel awkward or unsure of what to do or say. Don't worry if you don't know the right thing to do or say. Your presence and the simplest of gestures may be all that is required to help.
 
Each person grieves in their own time and their own way. Let them cry, scream, or sit quietly while you hold them. Whatever it takes to get their emotions out is OK.
 
Don't hide your grief or avoid the subject because you don't want to upset them. Instead, grieve together, hold each other and cry, or talk about the times you both spent with the person who has passed. If you don't mention the person at all, it may, in fact, feel as though you don't even care or understand how they are feeling. Open the communication lines.
 
Don't advise them to let go of clothing or personal effects before they're ready. Each person grieves in their own time. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" does not apply to someone you've loved deeply. Some people may want to let things go fairly quickly, while others will want to hold onto sentimental objects long-term.
 There's no right or wrong way to grieve, so don't pressure someone to do something that they are not ready for or comfortable doing. 
Each child is a unique person. One baby can never replace another. Don't philosophize or try to make things seem better. They're not. Instead, express your sincere sorrow for their loss, offer the support that you can, and try to simply be physically present to comfort your grieving loved one.
 
Realizing this doesn't diminish the pain and sense of loss. Even if the loss was after a long and painful illness, it does not make the grief any easier to deal with. Trying to make philosophical sense of someone's death can make it seem like you are minimizing the loss. Instead, simply say ""I'm so sorry"" and ""I'm here for you.""
 
These are just hollow words unless you have been in the same situation and can offer suggestions about what helped you to heal. Even if you have dealt with the same type of loss, remember that every situation is still unique and that everyone copes with grief differently. In many cases, it may be more helpful to simply offer your understanding rather than make suggestions to ""fix"" the situation.

Celexa (citalopram) is a commonly prescribed antidepressant. It is part of a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Celexa is an FDA-approved treatment for the symptoms of major depression, but it is also used off-label to treat anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorders, and eating disorders.﻿﻿
 
All antidepressants have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms. Although newer antidepressants like Celexa are less likely to lead to adverse reactions while you’re taking them, when you quit it’s a totally different story.
 Fortunately, Celexa is not among the worst offenders when it comes to withdrawal, but it still packs a punch. ﻿﻿ 
Overall, more than half (56 percent) of people quitting antidepressants experience withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can last for weeks, or longer. ﻿﻿ Unfortunately, there is no way to predict how—or if—you will be affected. Common symptoms of Celexa withdrawal include dizziness, irritability, sensory and flu-like symptoms. ﻿﻿ Occasionally, the dizziness can get so bad that it becomes hard to stand up.
 
When you quit Celexa, there is a possibility that you will relapse and begin experiencing symptoms of depression again. Discontinuing your dose can also lead to an increase in suicidal thinking and behavior. ﻿﻿
 
Celexa is an SSRI that works by increasing serotonin levels in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter—chemical messenger—involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety among other functions. When you take SSRIs regularly for an extended period of time, your brain becomes accustomed to this level of serotonin.
 
When your dose is suddenly discontinued or reduced, your brain has to adjust to lower levels of serotonin. This adjustment period can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.
 
 Celexa has a half-life of about 35 hours, that means that it takes 35 hours for half of the drug to effectively leave your system. It takes about one week for the drug to leave your system entirely. ﻿﻿ This is good, because it means withdrawal won’t hit hard and fast as soon as your dose is discontinued.
 
 For most people, Celexa withdrawal begins within three to six days of your last dose. Symptoms may continue for anywhere from five days to and in some cases over one month. ﻿﻿ Keep in mind that antidepressant withdrawal duration is a difficult thing for researchers to measure, so experiences can vary.
 
 The severity of SSRI withdrawal symptoms also varies widely. Recent research has found that the severity is worse than what doctors once believed. Researchers estimate that nearly half (46 percent) of people going through SSRI withdrawal describe their symptoms as severe. People with severe symptoms may have difficulty fulfilling their responsibilities at home and at work. 
 
 To get a better idea of the range of symptoms and symptom severity, you may want to check out the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale (DESS), which is sometimes used by clinicians. 
 
 The following is the complete list of symptoms associated with SSRI withdrawal:
 
If you are having trouble quitting Celexa, don’t worry, you have options. If you are quitting Celexa because your depression has abated and you have determined with your doctor that it makes sense to come off your antidepressant, you may want to consider a taper. Tapering a medication means incrementally reducing your dose over the course of several weeks or months. When it comes to SSRIs like Celexa, tapering isn’t always effective in avoiding withdrawal symptoms, but recent research has found more promising results.
 
New research suggests that a very slow taper (lasting several months) that continues well beyond therapeutic levels may help successfully manage withdrawal symptoms. This means that by the end of your taper, you will be taking a much smaller dose then what you started on. Your taper may continue until you are taking almost nothing.﻿﻿
 
If tapering isn’t working or you are still experiencing breakthrough symptoms, there are other steps you can take. A good first step is to reach out for support from family, friends, and other people struggling with antidepressant withdrawal. When you have social support, you are less likely to feel isolated, ashamed, or alone. When friends and family know what to expect, they can forgive you for being more anxious or agitated then normal. You can also look online for groups of people going through the same thing as you. It’s a great place to trade tips and tricks that you hadn’t thought of. Here are a few examples: 
 
Celexa, like other SSRIs, comes with a warning from the FDA about the potential increased risk of thoughts of suicide and suicidal behaviors in children and young adults. When you quit or change your dose, your risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may increase. ﻿﻿ 
 
If you or someone you love is quitting or has quit Celexa, it is important to know what to look for. Contact a doctor or emergency services if any of the following symptoms arise:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you become pregnant while taking Celexa, you have some decisions to make. Talk to your OB-GYN about the risks and benefits of continuing antidepressants during your pregnancy.
 
There is a small risk that women who take antidepressants during their second and third trimesters could experience preterm labor.
 
Unfortunately, women who choose to discontinue antidepressant therapy are five times more likely to have a depression relapse. Post-partum depression is harmful to both mother and baby. ﻿﻿
 
Your treatment outlook will depend on a variety of factors, such as why you have decided to quit antidepressants and what symptoms you are currently experiencing. If you are quitting Celexa because it wasn’t working or because the side effects were too much, then you should continue to seek treatment from a qualified mental health professional.
 
A psychiatrist can help you switch to another antidepressant, while a psychologist or therapist of another discipline can provide psychotherapy-based treatment. Keep in mind that psychotherapy and antidepressants can both effectively treat many of the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.
 
About 50 percent of people who recover from depression will have future depressive episodes.﻿﻿ To reduce your chances of relapse it is often important to continue on an antidepressant and participate in therapy. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and other universities have found that people engaging in psychotherapy while discontinuing antidepressants are less likely to relapse than those who do not. ﻿﻿ 
 
If you or someone you love is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255). You will be connected with staff or volunteers at a crisis center near you. The people on the other end of the line will be able to listen and help you figure out what to do next. It is available 24/7, 365 days per year. If you are hesitant to call, you may prefer to chat with a counselor. The chat services are also open 24/7. 
 
If you are interested in finding a new psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist in your area, there are several ways to find one. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a searchable directory of qualified providers. You can also call them at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) and a knowledgeable operator will search for you.
 
If you have health insurance, you can also search the company’s list of local providers who accept your insurance. Most insurance companies have at least some mental health coverage, including state and federal plans.
 
Although quitting Celexa may not be as easy as you thought it would be, the symptoms are often mild. While you’re doing your taper it helps to remind yourself that the discomfort you’re experiencing is only temporary. Your symptoms will go away eventually, and you’ll be back to your normal self.

Prozac is a well-known antidepressant that is used to treat a variety of disorders, including major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorders, and some eating disorders. Prozac (fluoxetine) belongs to a class of medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These drugs increase the amount of serotonin in your brain, which helps improve your mental health. When you stop taking an SSRI like Prozac, you may experience withdrawal symptoms while your brain adjusts to lower levels of serotonin. 
 
Antidepressants like Prozac are among the most commonly prescribed medications in America. In a given month, more than 40 million people take an antidepressant. As antidepressant use grew over the past two decades, more and more people began to realize how hard it is to quit. About one in four people on antidepressants have been taking them for ten years or more.﻿﻿
 
One of the reasons long-term antidepressant use is so common is that people are afraid to stop taking them. These concerns center around the potential for relapse of symptoms and possible withdrawal.
 
These fears are not entirely unfounded. SSRI withdrawal is a well-established condition. More than half (56%) of people who quit antidepressants experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, dizziness, nausea, and prickling sensations. Going off antidepressants can also increase your risk of relapse, including the return of symptoms of depression anxiety. Quitting also increases your risk of suicidal behavior.﻿﻿
 
 It is important to work with your doctor to weigh these risks against the potential risks of continuing Prozac. Prozac has a number of side effects that can have a negative impact on your life. While many of Prozac’s side effects dissipate over time, the sexual side effects tend to continue as long as you remain on the drug. Sexual side effects are a common motivator for people to stop taking Prozac.﻿﻿
 
The good news is that among the SSRIs, Prozac is the least likely to cause withdrawal symptoms. The reason for this is Prozac’s long half-life. A drug’s half-life is the time it takes for 50% of the drug to be effectively eliminated from your body. Most antidepressants are half out of the body in under 24 hours, but Prozac’s half-life is four to six days.﻿﻿
 
 Withdrawal symptoms typically begin when a drug is about 90% out of your body. With Prozac, this can take up to 25 days.﻿﻿
 
Prozac is unique among the antidepressants because withdrawal symptoms typically don’t appear for several weeks. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a double-edged sword, because Prozac withdrawal symptoms also tend to last longer—about two months.﻿﻿
 
The longer timeline associated with Prozac withdrawal increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Because withdrawal symptoms appear later and last longer, it is often mistaken for a relapse. This may lead people to unnecessarily start taking antidepressants again.
 
Recognizing the signs of Prozac withdrawal, along with the extended timeline on which they occur, can help you distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.
 
 Symptoms associated with SSRI withdrawal are varied, affecting many different systems.
 
Prozac withdrawal symptoms can range from mildly bothersome to severe and incapacitating. The Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale, or DESS, is a checklist you can use to evaluate your symptoms and their severity.
 
Quitting Prozac doesn’t have to be a nightmare. If you are worried about withdrawal, your doctor may recommend tapering your dose. When you taper your dose, by taking progressively smaller doses over a period of time, you can often prevent or reduce withdrawal symptoms.
 
Your doctor may recommend a short taper of one to two weeks (as given the long half life of prozac, in some respects it tapers itself) or a longer taper that plays out over the course of several weeks or months. Recent research suggests that a longer taper (at least one month) that continues until your dose is down to zero, is the best way to minimize SSRI withdrawal.﻿﻿
 
 If you are currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms, there are ways to ease your discomfort, including:
 
When quitting Prozac, there is a risk that symptoms of major depression will return in spades. Studies have shown that when your dose is changed or stopped, you may be at an increased risk for suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and actions. The risk may be greater for children, teens, and young adults.﻿﻿
 
Prozac comes with a black box warning (the FDA’s most serious warning) stating that children, teens, and young adults are at increased risk of suicidal ideation when starting these medications. They may also recommend close observation during, changing, or discontinuing their dose.﻿﻿ 
 
In the weeks and months following Prozac discontinuation, it is important to look out for suicidal behaviors. Signs of suicidal ideation include:
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
There are also risks of Prozac overdose, so make sure you seek immediate care.
 
After you stop taking Prozac, your long-term outlook will depend on your particular circumstances. If you are quitting Prozac because you find the side effects to be intolerable, then you will want to work with your doctor to find an alternative medication. There are many other antidepressants with lower rates of side effects that may be equally or even more effective at improving your moods.
 
About 50% of people who recover from one episode of depression will have more depressive episodes in their lifetime.﻿﻿ You may want to take other actions to reduce your risk of relapse.
 
Psychotherapy (talk therapy) is an evidence-based treatment for depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and other universities have found that people who participate in psychotherapy while discontinuing antidepressants are less likely to relapse than those who do not.﻿﻿
 
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline connects you with staff or volunteers at a crisis center near you. The people on the other end of the line can help you calm down and figure out what to do next.
 
If your doctor isn’t helping, consider finding a new psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist in your area. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a searchable directory of qualified providers. You can also call them at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).
 
If you have health insurance, you can also search the company’s list of local providers who accept your insurance.
 
When Prozac first arrived on the scene, it helped a lot of people. Today, there are many alternative antidepressants, so if you need to come off Prozac, there are ways to do this with your doctor safely and effectively.

If you have depression and are taking a prescription medication like Prozac, you might worry that it could show up on a drug test. This is especially a concern if you must take a pre-employment drug screen for a new job.
 
Because antidepressants are not considered drugs of abuse, they are not included in common urine drug screens. However, there may be cross-reactions that can produce false positive results for the substances these tests are designed to detect.
 
Learn the actions you can take to ensure your results are interpreted accurately and your rights are protected.
 
If you are in treatment for depression, the good news is that antidepressants are not the drugs that an employer is looking for in an employment drug screen. The lab would have to do specific additional tests to look for antidepressants. The types of substances tested for on a typical employment drug screens include:﻿﻿
 
False positive test results can sometimes occur if a prescription drug or its metabolite has a similar chemical structure to the target drug being tested for.﻿﻿
 Some antidepressants can inadvertently trigger a false positive for a controlled substance. To avoid this, advise the tester about any drugs you may be taking so that confirmatory tests can be performed to weed out any false positive. 
Certain antidepressant drugs are more prone to false-positive readings. For example, Wellbutrin (bupropion), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Desyrel (trazodone) can all potentially show up as amphetamines in a drug screen.
 
Similarly, Zoloft (sertraline) may show up as a benzodiazepine. Less commonly, antidepressants have been known to trigger false positives for LSD.
 
If you are concerned that your antidepressant might show up as a false positive, your best course of action is to be proactive. In addition to informing the technician about your antidepressant use, bring along the prescription bottle and ensure that the drug is notated on your record. It is better to declare this before the test rather than after.
 
Due to the risk of false positives, all drug screen results should be considered presumptive until confirmed by a second testing technique, such as liquid or gas mass spectrometry.
 If your drug screen is positive and a second confirmation test has not been done, demand that it be performed immediately, ideally with the same sample. Moreover, get a copy of both results to confirm that a different technique was used. 
Even if you are able to sort out any false positives from your drug screen, you may be concerned about the disclosure of your antidepressant drug use.
 
In most cases, any information you share with the tester won't be included on the result. The employees at the lab and your present or future supervisor will likely have no direct contact with each other. All your employer will receive is a list of positive and negative results to the requested drug screens.
 
Workplace harassment and discrimination for depression and other mental health conditions are prohibited under the Americans With Disabilities Act,﻿﻿ but you may have valid concerns about your rights being upheld.
 If you're concerned about confidentiality, ask the tester for a copy of the company's protected health information (PHI), outlining their legal duties and privacy practices as directed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
Although awareness about mental health conditions such as depression has grown over the years, it is still common for people with depression to worry about the stigma associated with a depression diagnosis.
 
It is fully understandable that you would want your depression diagnosis to be kept private, especially from a current or prospective employer. You may fear you could be discriminated against or singled out for the condition in the workplace, even with the legal protections in place.
 
First and most importantly, do not stop taking your medications or reducing the dosage unless you are doing so under the guidance of your physician. This is true even if you are concerned about false positives.
 
Even short-term interruptions can have serious consequences for the treatment of your condition, not least of which is antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS).﻿﻿ Discuss any concerns you have with your mental health provider so you can take the drug screen safely and without stress.
 
It is also important to remember that antidepressants aren't the only drugs that can trigger a false positive drug screen. Others include:
 
Facing a drug screen can make anyone anxious, especially when it is required for a job. You are not alone if you feel this way.
 
However, try not to stress unduly about taking a drug screen. Remember that false positives do happen and that most drug screening companies understand this. Simply divulge your prescriptions so that false positives can be avoided and your rights can be preserved.

While antidepressants have been shown to be effective in treating major depression and anxiety in children and teens, they need to be used cautiously and monitored closely to make sure there are no serious side effects.
 
Before your child starts on an antidepressant, it's best to have a complete physical examination to rule out any physical causes of depression or anxiety. If the physical exam turns out fine, the next step is to have a psychiatric evaluation done by a pediatrician, family doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist, preferably one who specializes in pediatric mental health.
 
This evaluation will include important information such as family history, behaviors you notice in your child and any risk factors there might be for him to hurt himself. Understanding all of these issues will help you and your mental health professional decide on the best course of action for your child, which may or may not include antidepressants.
 
If you and your physician decide that an antidepressant is necessary, your child will start on the lowest possible dose, to begin with. This may have to be adjusted if it's not helping your child's symptoms. The risk for suicidal thoughts and/or behavior is greatest during the first couple months of starting an antidepressant,﻿﻿ as well as if the dose is increased or decreased, so be particularly observant of your child's behavior during these times. Your mental health professional will likely want to monitor your child fairly closely at first as well. 
 
There are two antidepressants that the FDA has approved for use in children or teens to treat depression: Prozac (fluoxetine) for kids 8 and older and Lexapro (escitalopram) for kids 12 and older.﻿﻿ Additionally, Zoloft (sertraline), Luvox (fluvoxamine), and Anafranil (clomipramine) have been approved along with Prozac to treat kids with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).﻿﻿
 
Just because a medication is not FDA-approved doesn't mean that your doctor won't prescribe it, however, particularly if you have an older child. Physicians often prescribe other antidepressants for children and teens that are not FDA-approved because they have been proven to be effective and fairly safe. Be sure to read the medication guide that comes with your child's antidepressant to find out more information, such as risks, side effects, and cautions.
 
The most serious potential side effect of antidepressant use in people under 25 is that some data has shown that starting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may worsen suicidal thoughts.﻿﻿ This side effect is rare, but it's serious enough that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning about it on every prescription antidepressant.
 
Also, dealing with depression in and of itself can cause suicidal thoughts and/or behavior, which is yet another reason antidepressants should be considered carefully for moderate to severe depression with the help of your doctor. The benefits of using antidepressants usually outweigh the potential problems as they can be extremely helpful in an uplifting mood and lessening anxiety.
 
Warning signs of suicidal thoughts may not be very obvious, which is why you need to watch your child closely when she first starts on an antidepressant or whenever her dosage is changed. Warning signs may include:﻿﻿
 
If you see any of these signs in your child, particularly if they are new or noticeably worse than before, be sure to talk to your doctor as soon as possible.
 If your child is having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
In general, antidepressants are safe and effective to treat depression and anxiety in children and teenagers, especially when combined with psychotherapy.﻿﻿ Also, keep in mind that antidepressant use is often temporary and may just be needed for a short time. If your child has mild depression, psychotherapy may be all they need to help their symptoms improve.
 
However, if the depression is severe or not responding to psychotherapy, an antidepressant may be needed to help your child live the best and most fulfilling life they can. If you have concerns and questions, be sure to discuss them with a mental health professional.

Even though they're often used to treat anxiety, antidepressants can potentially cause anxiety, especially during the initiation of treatment for depression.﻿﻿
 
In addition to feeling jittery or anxious, people may also experience such symptoms as:
 
There also appears to be a complex relationship between the presence of these symptoms and other rare symptoms, such as mania, worsening depression, and suicidal thoughts—with children, teens, and young adults appearing to be the most susceptible.﻿﻿ In 2004, the FDA added a black box warning to all antidepressant labels describing these potentially serious side effects.
 Generally, however, any anxiety that you feel while taking an antidepressant will be mild. In addition, it will most likely dissipate in time as your body become adjusted to the medication.﻿﻿ 
The reason for this may be related to the levels of a neurotransmitter called serotonin. Low serotonin in the brain is thought to play an important role in causing both depression and anxiety. It is also believed that fluctuating serotonin levels during the early days of treatment might be the reason that some people feel anxiety as an antidepressant side effect.﻿﻿
 
If you find that your anxiety is unbearably strong or is not getting better—especially if you are experiencing certain other symptoms like mania, worsening depression or suicidal thoughts—do not hesitate to immediately contact your physician or seek emergency help.
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
You should not, however, stop taking your medication without first consulting with your doctor. Rapidly stopping your antidepressant may result in uncomfortable discontinuation symptoms or the reemergence of significant mood symptoms.﻿﻿ 
 
Your doctor can best advise you on what to do in order to avoid this problem.

For many people dealing with depression, prescription medications can be wonder drugs. Antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac (fluoxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline). They can have side effects and can be expensive depending on your health insurance coverage.
 
There are many ways to counter some of the symptoms of depression that don't involve prescription medications. If you have depression and would like to try handling it without drugs, or if you'd like to supplement your antidepressant with other tactics, check out these alternatives and then talk to your doctor about which might make sense as part of your treatment regimen.
 
Always take symptoms of depression seriously as depression doesn't just go away on its own. While there are many things you can do to support your mental health, don't try to just handle your symptoms alone. Talk to your doctor and discuss some of the self-help strategies that may support your treatment.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Sleep and mood go hand in hand. Get too little of the former and the latter is bound to flag (whether you have depression or not). Make sure you have what sleep experts call ""good sleep hygiene.""﻿﻿ This means you keep consistent bedtimes and wake-up times, your bedroom is set up for sound sleep (it's dark, quiet, and uncluttered), you have a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve sitting in front of a screen, and so on.
 The relationship between sleep and depression can be complex. Not only is poor sleep thought to contribute to the onset of depression, but depression may then cause low quality sleep. 
Whether you can't seem to get any sleep or can't seem to stop sleeping, there are steps you can take to try to improve the quality of your sleep.
 
Also, try to spend a little time outside each day, even on days when you are tempted to draw the shades and hide indoors. Light plays an important role in regulating sleep cycles and circadian rhythms,﻿﻿ so a lack of sunshine may be making it more difficult to sleep at night.
 
Coffee, tea, soda, and even chocolate are steeped in caffeine. It's fine to indulge in a reasonable amount of caffeine in the morning, but if you do, don't consume caffeine after late afternoon so it doesn't interfere with sleep.
 
If you do tend to rely on caffeine, try cutting back gradually in order to avoid unpleasant symptoms of caffeine withdrawal. When you are craving a soda or cup of coffee, try going for a short walk around the block instead.
 
There's some evidence that a deficiency of this important nutrient could play a role in depression.﻿﻿ If you aren't getting enough vitamin D through your diet and lifestyle (like sun exposure), ask your doctor if you should try taking a supplement. Certain nutrient deficiencies can play a role in depression symptoms. If you are having a difficult time spending enough time outdoors or if overcast weather conditions make it hard to get sunshine, a supplement may be useful.
 
For treating mild to moderate depression, dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e), and 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) may be worth a try.﻿﻿
 Research has shown that St. John's wort is more effective than a placebo at relieving symptoms in those with mild-to-moderate depression.﻿﻿ 
Be careful with these substances, though. Don't take any of them without checking with your doctor first. Just because they're available without a prescription and are touted as natural doesn't mean they're always safe. For example, mixing St. John's wort with an SSRI such as Prozac can lead to a complication called serotonin syndrome.﻿﻿ Also, SAM-e carries a risk for hypomania/mania in bipolar disorder. 
 
No need to join a church, synagogue, or mosque (although certainly for many people dealing with depression, religion can be an impactful source of support). But simple daily practices such as meditation or adding to a list of things you're grateful can help boost mood and overall well-being.
 Meditation can have a range of beneficial effects such as lowering stress levels and helping people to become more aware of their thoughts and reactions. 
Research indicates that an intervention called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which combines elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with mindfulness meditation, can be helpful in treating depression and preventing future relapses of symptoms.﻿﻿ Studies also suggest that different types of mindfulness meditative practices can also be effective in the treatment of depression.﻿﻿
 
There are many different types of meditation, but you can get started with a simple meditative exercise:
 
This doesn't mean train for a marathon, but it does mean putting in a half-hour or so of low-intensity activity each day, which has been found to be effective in improving mood and quality of life.﻿﻿ Even better, take it outdoors. Fresh air and sunshine are especially healing for folks dealing with a special form of depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
 
While research has shown that regular physical activity can be effective in both the prevention and treatment of depression,﻿﻿ it can be hard to start an exercise habit when you're depressed. Lack of energy and low mood may mean that you simply feel too fatigued to get up and get active.
 
Some things that you can try to stick to your habit:
 
Alcohol in and of itself is a depressant. Oddly enough, drinking can interfere with sleep, and quality sleep is a key to battling the blues. While alcohol might seem like a quick fix to escape what you are feeling, it can actually make many of the symptoms of depression feel much worse.﻿﻿ Not only that, but it can decrease inhibitions and potentially lead to risky behaviors and bad decisions that can have long-term consequences.
 If you're taking any sort of antidepressant, you really shouldn't drink at all. Alcohol doesn't interact well with medication. 
If you have been misusing alcohol or other substances and need help quitting, talk to your doctor. You may also have an alcohol or substance use disorder as well. Withdrawal symptoms may temporarily worsen symptoms of depression, so you may need extra assistance as you go through this process.
 
What you put in your mouth can have a direct effect on how you think and feel. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet, one that's rich in nutrients and low in saturated fat. A nutritionist or dietitian can help you analyze your eating habits and pinpoint potential nutrient deficiencies that could contribute to depression.
 
Some foods that may be beneficial when you have depression:
 
Pollyanna-ish as it may sound, thinking good thoughts can help you feel good. Your thoughts truly do have a direct bearing on your mood. If you're struggling with negativity, consider seeing a therapist to help you learn ways to counter it.
 
One of the most popular and effective treatments used in the treatment of depression is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).﻿﻿ This form of psychotherapy focuses on identifying negative thinking patterns and then replacing them with more positive ones. There are different ways that you can practice some of these ideas on your own.
 
Learn to Recognize Negative Thinking
 
Sometimes these thoughts can be obvious, such as times when you berate or criticize yourself. Other times, they can be more subtle. You might find yourself engaging in things like catastrophizing or all-or-nothing thinking.
 
Catastrophizing involves always anticipating negative outcomes. All-or-nothing thinking means that you think of things as either successes or failures. Once you get better at recognizing these cognitive patterns, you can start working on some healthier replacements.
 
Reframe Your Thoughts
 
When you find yourself having a negative thought, consciously reframe it in a positive way. For example, you might replace something like ""This will never work"" with something more positive such as, ""Here are a few things that I can try that will help me get started."" Shifting your focus to your strengths and abilities can help you maintain a more positive mindset.
 
Stress can drive up levels of a brain chemical called cortisol, which has been found to be higher in folks with depression.﻿﻿ There are lots of strategies for coping with stress, such as time management, meditation, and biofeedback training.
 
Some stress-relieving activities that you might want to incorporate into your daily life include:
 
Learning to manage your stress takes time and practice. Talk to your doctor or therapist about other strategies you might try to minimize the stress and your response to it.
 
When you're depressed, there's no reason to go it alone—and all sorts of reasons to reach out to friends and family. Make plans with loved ones and keep those dates. Join a club or sign up for a group activity such as a local dodgeball league, for example, or a French class.
 
Other things you might try:
 
The problem is that depression often causes people to withdraw, which only further exacerbates feelings of isolation and loneliness. Even when you don't feel like going out or being social, try reaching out in whatever way is most comfortable for you. Enlist a few of your closes loved ones who understand what you are experiencing.
 
Doing the things you used to do might not bring you quite the same enjoyment, but getting out of the house and spending time with people who care about you can help you feel better.

 Give yourself a period to unwind before you go to bed; do something relaxing and avoid stressful tasks or thoughts. Go to bed at the same time each night, and set an alarm so that you wake at the same time each morning. Have a consistent bedtime routine. Turn off your devices and try reading a book for a few minutes. Sit comfortably Close your eyes Breath naturally Focus on how your body feels while you breathe When your mind wanders, redirect attention back to your breathing Enlist a friend. Ask a loved one to walk with you or do another form of exercise at least a few times a week. Having the support of a friend can not only help get you into a routine, but it can also help you maintain those social connections when you are feeling down. Remind yourself of the benefits. Getting started is tough, but doing it is something that will help you feel better in the long-term. Start small. Try walking for just a few minutes each day, then work on gradually increasing your walks. Fish: Research has found that people who ate a diet high in fish were less likely to have symptoms of depression.﻿﻿﻿ Fish are high in omega-3 fats, which play a role in helping neurotransmitters such as serotonin work in the brain. Nuts: Nuts are also a good source of omega-3 fats and one study indicated that people who ate walnuts were 26% less likely to have symptoms of depression.﻿﻿ Probiotics: Research is increasingly pointing to a connection between gut and brain health.﻿﻿ Foods high in probiotics include yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and kombucha. Deep breathing: A few minutes to slow your breathing and focus your attention on your body in the moment can help you get a better handle on your worries. Exercise: Regular physical activity is a great way to blow off steam. Progressive muscle relaxation: This process involves intentionally tightening muscles throughout the body, holding that tension for several counts, and then releasing that tension until the muscles are completely lax. With regular practice, you may be able to learn how to intentionally relax your body fairly quickly whenever you are feeling tense.﻿﻿ Join a support group. Talking to other people who are facing the same experiences and challenges can be informative and helpful. Schedule activities. Having routines can be helpful when you are going through depression. Create a daily schedule that includes spending time with others. You are more likely to stick to it if its a scheduled event. Volunteer. Joining a cause that you care about is a great way to meet new people and expand your social circle.",many people deal depression prescription medications wonder drug antidepressants especially

"
Most parents would never ignore their child’s broken bone or obvious signs of physical injury. Yet, when it comes to a child’s mental illness, symptoms often go untreated for months or even years.
 
Some parents don’t recognize the warning signs of a teenage mental illness. Others worry that their child will get labeled as ""crazy"" if they seek help.
 
But early intervention and proper treatment is the key to helping your teen feel better.﻿﻿ If you suspect your teen has a mental illness, seek professional help right away.
 
Sometimes, parents struggle to acknowledge their suspicion that their teen may have a mental illness. But ignoring the problem isn’t likely to make it go away. In fact, without treatment, your teen’s mental health is likely to get worse.
 
Without proper treatment, your teen may be tempted to try self-medicating. They may reach for drugs, alcohol, food, or other unhealthy habits that temporarily dull their pain. Ultimately, self-medicating only adds more problems to your teen’s life.
 
Untreated mental health problems may also increase your teen’s risk of suicide. Most teens who kill themselves have a mood disorder, like depression or bipolar.
 
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 19.﻿﻿ The vast majority of teens who kill themselves give some type of warning sign that they’re feeling helpless and hopeless first.
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If your teen makes comments about wanting to hurt themselves or kill themselves, take it very seriously. Don’t assume they are just saying those things ""to get attention,"" or ""because they're mad."" Consider such comments a serious warning sign that your teen is struggling.
 
Adolescence is a common time for mental health issues to emerge. Researchers suspect this is due to a variety of factors.
 
Hormonal changes and brain development during adolescence may put teens at a higher risk of mental health problems. Some researchers have explained this phenomenon by saying, “moving parts get broken,” which means that when all the parts of the neural system don’t develop at the correct rate, a teen may experience changes in thinking, mood, and behavior.﻿﻿
 There is a genetic link to some mental health issues. If one or both of a teen’s biological parents has a mental health problem, a teen may be at an increased risk of developing one as well. 
Environmental issues can also be a factor in a teen’s mental health. Traumatic incidents, like a near-death experience or a history of abuse, may increase your teen’s risk.
 
Stress can also be a factor in developing mental illness.﻿﻿ If your teen is being bullied at school or if he puts a lot of pressure on himself to perform well academically, he may be more susceptible to mental health issues.
 
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 49.5% of adolescents will experience mental illness at some point between the ages of 13 and 18.﻿﻿
 
The most common mental health disorders found in teenagers are:
 
Teens may also develop psychotic disorders, like schizophrenia, or substance use disorders, like alcohol abuse or opioid dependence.﻿﻿
 
Distinguishing a mental illness from hormonal changes, teenage phases, and normal mood swings becomes a challenge. But it’s important to monitor your teen’s mood and behavior and if you notice changes that interfere with your teen’s daily life, it likely isn’t normal.
 
Mental illness presents differently in different people. Some warning signs of teenage mental illness include (but are not limited to) these behaviors.﻿﻿
 
Mental health issues are usually very treatable. And a problem doesn’t mean your teen is ""crazy."" Instead, it means your teen needs medical attention.
 
Similar to the way some teens develop physical health problems, like asthma or acne, others develop mental health problems, like obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder.
 Stay calm, but take action. Rather than spend months worrying about a potential problem, commit to finding out if your teen could benefit from treatment. 
Bringing up concerns about your teen’s mental health may feel uncomfortable at first. But, it’s important to talk to your teen about the red flags you’re seeing.
 
Point out your observations and invite your teen’s input. Be careful not to infer your teen is ‘crazy’ or that it’s his fault. Here are some examples of things you might say:
 
Don’t be surprised if your teen insists nothing is wrong or he becomes irritated by your suggestion. Many teens are embarrassed, ashamed, afraid, or confused by the symptoms they’re experiencing.
 
It’s possible your teen will feel relieved when you bring up the subject as well. Sometimes, teens know they are struggling, but aren’t sure how to tell anyone what they’re experiencing.
 
It is important for teens to have healthy adults they can talk to about issues going on in their life—and quite often they're more willing to talk to someone other than their parents. So, make sure your teen has other people in their life can talk to.
 
Help them identify at least three trusted adults they might be able to talk to about any problems, concerns, or issues they're having.
 
Ask, “If you had a problem and you couldn’t talk to me about it, who could you talk to?” While many teens are happy to talk to their friends, a teen’s peers may lack the wisdom to deal with serious problems. So, it’s best if your teen has older people they can count on as well.
 
Family friends, relatives, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors, and friend’s parents might be among the people they can talk to. Reassure them that it’s OK to bring up problems with those people whom you agree are trustworthy.
 
It can also be a good time to ask, “Do you ever think it might be a good idea to have a professional to talk to?” Sometimes teens aren’t comfortable asking to see a therapist, but some of them may welcome the idea if you suggest it first.
 
If your teen’s mental illness is nearing a crisis level, go to your local emergency room.
 Threats of suicide, serious self-injury, or hallucinations are just a few reasons to get your teen evaluated immediately. 
For mental health concerns that aren’t an immediate crisis, schedule a doctor’s appointment for your teen. Talk to your teen about the appointment the same way you’d discuss an appointment for an earache or a regular check-up.
 
Say, “I’ve scheduled a doctor’s appointment for you on Thursday. I know you aren’t concerned about how tired you’ve been lately, but I want to get you checked out by the doctor just to make sure.”
 
Explain your concerns to the doctor and give your teen an opportunity to speak with the doctor alone. Your teen may talk more openly when you’re not present.
 
The evaluation may put your mind at ease and assure your teen is healthy. Or, the doctor may recommend you seek additional treatment from a mental health professional, like an adolescent therapist.
 
If a doctor recommends further assessment, your teen may be referred to a mental health professional. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or licensed clinical social worker, may interview you and your teen to gather more information.
 
Some mental health professionals provide written questionnaires or other screening tools. A trained mental health professional will likely gather information from your teen’s doctor as well. A mental health professional can provide you with an appropriate diagnosis (if applicable) and will present you with treatment options, such as talk therapy or medication.
 
A teen’s mental health affects the entire family, so it’s important to seek support for yourself if you're teen has a mental illness.
 
Talking to other parents can be key to staying mentally strong. Some parents find comfort in gaining emotional support from parents who understand, and others find it helpful to learn about community resources and educational options.
 
Look for a local support group or talk to your teen’s doctor to learn about programs in your community. You might also find it helpful to research online forums or groups that could offer you help.
 
You might also consider meeting with a therapist on your own. A mental health professional may be able to ensure you’re managing your stress well so you can be best equipped to help your child.
 ADHD Mood Disorders Major Depression Conduct Disorder Anxiety Disorders Panic Disorder Eating Disorders Changes in sleep habits – Your teen may complain of insomnia or she might start taking naps after school. Wanting to stay in bed all day or stay up all night may also be signs of a problem. Loss of interest in usual activities – If your teen quits her favorite activities, or shows a lack of interest in spending time with friends, she may be experiencing a problem. Major changes in academic performance – Mental health issues often lead to dramatic changes in motivation to do school work. If your teen has lost interest in doing her homework, or she suddenly falls behind in school, it could be a sign of a problem. Weight or appetite changes – Skipping meals, hoarding food, and rapid changes in weight could be a sign of an eating disorder. Depression is often characterized by weight changes as well. Extreme moodiness – Excessive anger, unexpected weeping, and high levels of irritability can be a sign of a mental illness. Increased isolation – A strong desire to be alone or excessive secrecy may be a sign of a problem. “I see you are spending more time in your room by yourself and you aren’t going out with your friends. I’m concerned about that.” “I’ve noticed you haven’t been doing much homework lately. I’m wondering if you just haven’t been in the mood to deal with school.” “You are sleeping a lot more than usual.

While there is no way to predict how your child will react to the death of a parent, or how this loss will affect them, some circumstances may increase the likelihood that a child will experience depression after a parent dies. Surviving parents and family members can take steps to ensure that your child receives the support or treatment they need to heal.
 
The way that you and other caregivers react to death will affect how your child reacts. As a parent or caregiver, you will need to address your own grief through outside support or counseling for the benefit of the whole family. Getting the support you need will show your child that healing is important.
 Parents and caregivers who express and discuss their feelings are likely to have children who do the same, whereas families who hide their emotions may teach a child to be ashamed of their feelings. Keeping feelings inside is a common behavior among people with depression. 
Collaborative healing efforts will provide your child with the extra support and love they need during this difficult time. Your child's pediatrician, teachers, and friends' parents need to know about the parent's death. Reaching out to those who have daily contact with your child will increase the available support.
 
Make an appointment with your child's pediatrician to discuss how your child is coping.
 
Grief is a normal process and typically does not require medication or therapy. However, you may initially need to spend more time with your child and assure them that you will not leave.
 
Talking with your child on an age-appropriate level and encouraging questions provides a supportive environment. Here are some more suggestions for supporting your preschool and school-age children through the grieving process:
 
While a loss of a parent or caregiver is traumatic for any child, the likelihood of this turning into depression depends on four factors, according to a report in the Journal of American Psychiatry.
 
Researchers found that children whose parents died by suicide or an accident were at higher risk for depression than children whose parents died after developing a sudden and natural illness.﻿﻿ Additionally, they found that children in the following situations were more likely to experience depression within two years of the loss when compared to their peers:
 While these findings suggest that certain circumstances surrounding a parent's death may increase the likelihood of depression in some children, it is important to understand that not all children in these circumstances will become depressed as a result. 
It is normal for a child to feel sad or scared when a parent dies. But if their sadness or fear continues for an extended period of time, worsens or significantly interferes with their normal functioning, it's important to consult your child's physician for evaluation. Seek immediate attention if your child has thoughts of suicide or self-harm.
 
Early identification and treatment of depression in children are important, as there is potential for short- and long-term consequences such as low self-esteem, substance use, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.
 If you or your child are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Children who are depressed may feel hopeless, guilty, angry, or misunderstood. Here are a few more signs to watch for:
 
You cannot prevent your child's loss, but you can support them through this difficult time by allowing them to grieve and by creating a safe and loving environment. Part of that support is recognizing when your child has become depressed and seeking treatment to help them heal.
 Answer any questions they have honestly, but try to keep your answers simple and brief. It's also OK to say that you don't know or that you don't have the answer right now. Avoid using euphemisms for death, such as ""resting"" or ""sleeping forever,"" as this can be confusing for a child. Instead, explain that when someone dies, their body stops working. They can no longer breathe, talk, move, eat, etc. Reinforce the fact that death is part of life—not a form of punishment. Share any religious or spiritual believes your family has about death and dying. Make sure the child understands that it is not their fault and they are not to blame. Help them understand that their parent is not going to “come back,” even if they are ""good."" Be careful about associating death with sickness as this can cause them to become fearful about their own illnesses. Use books and online resources to help them understand death. Encourage them to express their emotions and feelings by writing or drawing a picture. Explain what to expect at the memorial services and allow your child to decide if they want to attend. If your child decides to attend, ask a trusted friend or family member to be available in case they can't handle it and want to leave early. Allow older children and teens to play a role in planning the memorial if they want; this can include gathering pictures to display or picking a favorite poem or reading for the memorial service. Encourage your child to spend time with friends and participate in hobbies and social activities; remind them that having fun is OK and it doesn't mean you don't miss or love your deceased parent. Let them know that it will take time to feel better and that it's normal to experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, guilt, shame, and anxiety. Teens, in particular, may deal with sadness with displays of anger or risky behavior (such as unprotected sex or substance use). Remind children how much the deceased parent loved them and do your best to talk about them, show them pictures, and share memories. Past mental health illness, like depression Feelings of accountability for the parent's death Lost a mother Changes in sleeping habits and appetite Withdrawal from family, friends, and hobbies that they used to enjoy A significant drop in school performance Avoidance of school or social activities Vague, unexplained physical complaints, like a headache or bellyache Difficulty concentrating and making decisions",way predict child react death parent loss affect circumstances may increase likelihood child experience depression parent die survive parent family members take step ensure child receive support treatment need heal way caregivers react death affect child react parent caregiver need address grief outside support counsel benefit whole family get support need show child heal important parent caregivers express discuss feel likely children whereas families hide emotions may teach child ashamed feel keep feel inside common behavior among people depression collaborative heal efforts provide child extra support love need difficult time child pediatrician teachers friends parent need know parent death reach daily contact child increase available support make appointment child pediatrician discuss child cop grief normal process typically require medication therapy however may initially need spend time child assure leave talk child age appropriate level encourage question provide supportive environment suggestions support preschool school age children grieve process loss parent caregiver traumatic child likelihood turn depression depend four factor accord report journal american psychiatry researchers find children whose parent die suicide accident higher risk depression children whose parent die develop sudden natural illness additionally find children follow situations likely experience depression within two years loss compare peer find suggest certain circumstances surround parent death may increase likelihood depression children important understand children circumstances become depress result normal child feel sad scar parent die sadness fear continue extend period time worsen significantly interfere normal function important consult child physician evaluation seek immediate attention child thoughts suicide self harm early identification treatment depression children important potential short long term consequences low self esteem substance use suicidal thoughts behavior child suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database children depress may feel hopeless guilty angry misunderstand sign watch prevent child loss support difficult time allow grieve create safe love environment part support recognize child become depress seek treatment help heal answer question honestly try keep answer simple brief also say know answer right avoid use euphemisms death rest sleep forever confuse child instead explain someone die body stop work longer breathe talk move eat etc reinforce fact death part life form punishment share religious spiritual believe family death die make sure child understand fault blame help understand parent come back even good careful associate death sickness cause become fearful illnesses use book online resources help understand death encourage express emotions feel write draw picture explain expect memorial service allow child decide want attend child decide attend ask trust friend family member available case handle want leave early allow older children teens play role plan memorial want include gather picture display pick favorite poem read memorial service encourage child spend time friends participate hobbies social activities remind fun mean miss love decease parent let know take time feel better normal experience range emotions include sadness anger guilt shame anxiety teens particular may deal sadness display anger risky behavior unprotected sex substance use remind children much decease parent love best talk show picture share memories past mental health illness like depression feel accountability parent death lose mother change sleep habit appetite withdrawal family friends hobbies use enjoy significant drop school performance avoidance school social activities vague unexplained physical complaints like headache bellyache difficulty concentrate make decisions

Given the association between low self-esteem and depression risk, people sometimes question whether or not depression and self-esteem are similar concepts. While low self-esteem is a risk factor for depression, this does not mean that the two are the same.
 
Both self-esteem and depression are thought to work on a sort of continuum, or scale, ranging from high to low self-esteem, and no depressive symptoms to debilitating depressive symptoms.
 
Self-esteem is the way you view yourself—flaws, positive characteristics, and all. It's developed by your experiences, thoughts, feelings, and relationships. If your child has low self-esteem, they will generally view themselves as highly flawed, think little of their own ideas and opinions, and worry that they are not good enough. They also might struggle to accept positive feedback and see everyone around them as better than they are.﻿﻿
 
Depression is much more than just feeling sad. It saps your energy, makes everyday activities difficult and interferes with your eating and sleeping patterns. Psychotherapy and/or medication are highly effective in treating depression. There are several types of depressive disorders, including major depression, persistent depressive disorder (PDD), psychotic depression, postpartum depression (PPD), and seasonal affective disorder (SAD).﻿﻿ 
 
Low self-esteem and depression share many of the same signs and symptoms, including:
 
Despite the obvious similarities between low self-esteem and depression, research supports the view that they are, in fact, separate and different concepts.
 
According to experts, it is more likely that low self-esteem is a risk factor for depression in children, as opposed to being one and the same.﻿﻿
 
Another difference is that some kids will try to compensate for their low self-esteem by trying to please others and be accepted. In these cases, kids might excel in academics and behave well.
 
Most kids with significant depression, on the other hand, will suffer noticeable changes in behavior and academic performance as well as a loss of interest in social activities and appearance.
 
The warning signs of self-esteem issues include:
 
If your teen has depression, they may experience all of these signs of low self-esteem as well as the following red flags:﻿﻿

There are some small but significant steps parents and caregivers can take to help build a healthy sense of self-esteem in their child:﻿﻿
 
A child with low self-esteem may be at risk for a depressive episode, but their self-esteem concerns don't necessarily mean they are currently depressed. For both symptoms of self-esteem and depression, early identification is extremely important, especially for children. A proper diagnosis and preventative treatment can reduce the severity of a child's course of depression.﻿﻿
 
If your child shows signs of low self-esteem or depression, talk to their pediatrician or other mental health professionals for an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment options. While many parents fear heavy-duty medication, depression treatment for children most often involves talk therapy, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help them identify and change unhealthy thought patterns that contribute to poor self-esteem and depression.

The negative effects of depression on relationships involving children, teens, or adults are well-established. In general, depressed children and adolescents report having less satisfying relationships and feeling more insecure about their relationships.
 
Forming romantic relationships is an important developmental step for adolescents, as teen relationships teach important skills that aid future adult ones.
 
Adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms may lack problem-solving skills, resulting in difficulty resolving conflict in romantic relationships through early adulthood, according to a study published in The Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology in 2011.﻿﻿
 
Researchers investigated the depressive symptoms, problem-solving skills, and conflict resolution behavior of 200 10th-grade students over a period of four and a half years. They suggest that depressive symptoms may interfere with the acquisition of problem-solving skills, which appear to be essential for future romantic relationships.
 Common symptoms of depression, such as social withdrawal, feeling misunderstood, or irritability, may decrease a child's desire to form relationships at all. 
Depression often causes people to feel more irritable. This can be problematic in romantic relationships, but it can impact other social interactions as well including those with friends, family, classmates, teachers, and co-workers.
 
Because interacting with people is often difficult or exhausting when you are depressed, teens and young adults may withdraw from friends and family. People who are depressed may also feel worthless and unworthy, which further exacerbates social withdrawal. 
 
Lack of relationships, of course, may deprive such youth of the problem-solving and conflict resolution skills that will serve them well in adulthood.
 
Distress in a relationship has been identified as a precursor and consequence of childhood depression. Given this, parents of children or adolescents who show significant distress or difficulty in relationships should watch out for other signs and symptoms of depression, such as:
 
Even subsyndromal symptoms of depression are shown to negatively affect romantic relationships. Therefore, the early identification and treatment of even mild depressive symptoms in childhood could have important benefits for your child.
 
Social support can be an important tool for coping with symptoms of depression. If you start to notice signs that you are withdrawing from friends or that you are struggling to maintain relationships with partners, there are things you can do:
 
It can be difficult to see the person you are in a relationship with struggle with feelings of depression. If you suspect that your loved one might be depressed:

All children and adolescents will have ups and downs in their relationships, but if you feel like your child's relationship difficulties are significantly interfering with their daily functioning, it is worth talking to their pediatrician or mental health provider to explore what's happening. On the other hand, depression may not be the cause of a child's bad relationship. Incompatibility or the fleeting nature of young love could be to blame as well.
 Sadness Feelings of guilt Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Unexplained physical complaints Sleeping and appetite changes Talk about it. While it can be helpful to be around upbeat people when you are feeling down, it can also feel exhausting. When you need some time and space, let the people around you know what you are going through and ask for a little space. Find ways to connect on your terms. If you aren't able to spend time socializing because of your depression, try to find other ways to connect. Talking on the phone, texting, or other forms of online communication can help you maintain positive social connections. Let your partner know that you might need some space to decompress and deal with your emotions privately. Have realistic expectations. Your partner, no matter how sympathetic, might not be able to fully understand. Let them know that what you are looking for is support. Join an online support group. Online communities can be a helpful place to find support and connections when you are depressed. It can also be helpful to talk to other teens who are going through the same thing. Have empathy. Depression is a serious condition, not something that someone can simply pull themselves out of if they ""try hard enough."" Ask your loved one how they are feeling, express support, and encourage them to talk to a doctor or mental health professional. Be supportive. Feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and irritability are all common symptoms of depression. Let your loved one know that you care and that you accept them, even when they are feeling low. Don't go it alone. It's important to understand that while you can show your love and support for your loved one, it is not your job to ""fix"" things. If you need help, reach out to a trusted adult such as your parents, your partner's parents, a teacher, or your school counselor.",negative effect depression relationships involve children teens adults well establish general depress children adolescents report less satisfy relationships feel insecure relationships form romantic relationships important developmental step adolescents teen relationships teach important skills aid future adult ones adolescents high level depressive symptoms may lack problem solve skills result difficulty resolve conflict romantic relationships early adulthood accord study publish journal clinical child adolescent psychology researchers investigate depressive symptoms problem solve skills conflict resolution behavior grade students period four half years suggest depressive symptoms may interfere acquisition problem solve skills appear essential future romantic relationships common symptoms depression social withdrawal feel misunderstand irritability may decrease child desire form relationships depression often cause people feel irritable problematic romantic relationships impact social interactions well include friends family classmates teachers workers interact people often difficult exhaust depress teens young adults may withdraw friends family people depress may also feel worthless unworthy exacerbate social withdrawal lack relationships course may deprive youth problem solve conflict resolution skills serve well adulthood distress relationship identify precursor consequence childhood depression give parent children adolescents show significant distress difficulty relationships watch sign symptoms depression even subsyndromal symptoms depression show negatively affect romantic relationships therefore early identification treatment even mild depressive symptoms childhood could important benefit child social support important tool cop symptoms depression start notice sign withdraw friends struggle maintain relationships partner things difficult see person relationship struggle feel depression suspect love one might depress suicidal thoughts contact national suicide prevention lifeline support assistance train counselor love one immediate danger call mental health resources see national helpline database children adolescents down relationships feel like child relationship difficulties significantly interfere daily function worth talk pediatrician mental health provider explore happen hand depression may cause child bad relationship incompatibility fleet nature young love could blame well sadness feel guilt feel hopelessness worthlessness unexplained physical complaints sleep appetite change talk helpful around upbeat people feel also feel exhaust need time space let people around know ask little space find ways connect term able spend time socialize depression try find ways connect talk phone texting form online communication help maintain positive social connections let partner know might need space decompress deal emotions privately realistic expectations partner matter sympathetic might able fully understand let know look support join online support group online communities helpful place find support connections depress also helpful talk teens thing empathy depression serious condition something someone simply pull try hard enough ask love one feel express support encourage talk doctor mental health professional supportive feel worthlessness low self esteem irritability common symptoms depression let love one know care accept even feel low alone important understand show love support love one job fix things need help reach trust adult parent partner parent teacher school counselor

Broody, introspective, self-conscious, even self-absorbed, are words parents might use to describe their teens from time to time. While it's true that many preteens and adolescents demonstrate these characteristics, research has shown there may be a link between depression in children and increased self-focus.﻿﻿
 
In general, people with depression tend to think about themselves, examine their personalities, mull over their feelings, and question their motives more than non-depressed people do. While depression in children and adults can look (and feel) different, these tendencies may be shared by people with depression regardless of age.
 
At first, it may sound counter-intuitive that a person with depression would be self-focused, but the reality is that depression tends to give people a heightened sense of self-consciousness.
 
In turn, self-consciousness or a negative sense of self-awareness tends to increase negative emotional states (such as sadness, hopelessness, or anger). In these states, a person is more likely to focus on setbacks and negative experiences, which continues to feed the emotional cycle of depression.﻿﻿
 A child who is depressed might perseverate on a disagreement they had with a friend or be extremely worried and upset about a poor grade they received on a test. 
Studies have indicated that female children may be especially vulnerable to depression during the preteen years due to chronic peer stress combined with other environmental and genetic factors.
 
Depression can look and feel different for everyone who experiences it, but there can be some notable differences in how depression manifests in children compared to adults. For example, while an adult who is depressed may feel and seem sad, a child is more likely to appear irritable.﻿﻿
 
Children are still learning how to identify and explain how they feel, which can make it more difficult for caregivers to notice depression. However, there are some symptoms of depression in children that are easier to spot.
 
Your child may not display all of the symptoms, or may only show certain ones at specific times or in a particular environment (such as at home or school).
 
A child who is depressed may show or experience:
 
If you are concerned about your child's wellbeing, don't hesitate to ask your pediatrician for help. They can connect you with mental health resources in the community or even your child's school to ensure they get the support they need.
 
A child who appears self-absorbed or self-conscious is not necessarily depressed. In general, all children go through periods of self-absorption and self-focus and may display feelings of self-consciousness. In fact, these behaviors are a normal stage of child development.
 
But if your child's self-consciousness is extreme and they have persistent symptoms of depression (generally lasting longer than two weeks), you'll want to discuss their behavior with your pediatrician. They will rule out other causes for your child's symptoms, such as a medical condition or a different mental health disorder.
 
It can be very difficult for a child to navigate a depressive state. Negative thoughts, self-consciousness, and intense emotions tend to be cyclic and can have a compounding effect, leading to more negative thoughts and feelings.
 
Children may not understand the feelings they have, and they may be afraid or ashamed of how they feel. Even if you ask them directly, they may not be able to express to you that they are depressed.
 
As adults do, children and teens with depression need help as they learn to navigate, and eventually manage, the condition. If your child is depressed, counseling can help them cope with the cycle.
 
If you think your child might be depressed, don't try to diagnose the condition yourself. Your child's pediatrician, a mental health provider, and school counselor can work together to properly evaluate your child. Accurate diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential for managing depression at any age.

If you are a parent of a child with depression, you may wonder what the likely consequences of depression are and if treatment is necessary. The reality is that depression has the potential for very serious consequences in young people, especially when left untreated.
 
It is important to know that, though all children with depression suffer the painful emotional experience of the condition, not all children with depression will experience all of the other potential negative consequences.
 There is no sure way to determine which children will go on to experience them and which will not. 
As such, it is important to identify and treat any depression symptoms in children as soon as possible.
 
Consequences of depression range from mild to severe and may appear years after a depressive episode, especially when left untreated.
 
Children with depression may begin to withdraw from friends or family. They may appear unfriendly to others or irritate them. Unfortunately, this can lead to the loss of relationships, difficulty forming and keeping new relationships and the potential for getting involved in negative or abusive future relationships.
 
Children who have had a depressive episode, especially those with untreated depression, are more likely to experience recurrent depressive episodes or to develop an additional mental illness.
 
Children who are depressed may engage in behaviors that they would otherwise avoid because they are dangerous. This can include reckless driving, vandalism, breaking the rules at school or otherwise getting in trouble with the law.
 
For some, substance use may be a way of self-medicating to feel better or ""normal."" Substance abuse due to childhood depression typically begins in adolescence but may start as early as age 10.
 
A common symptom of childhood depression is academic decline. When this is present and the child's depression remains untreated, the problem is likely to get worse and to be more difficult to recover from.
 
The most serious risk of depression is suicide. Feelings of hopelessness, isolation and worthless may lead to thoughts of suicide.

All of these effects are scary and reading about them collectively might even be overwhelming for parents of a depressed child. But remember that not every child will experience the above reactions to depressions and getting your child help as soon as possible can reduce her risk. There are many treatment options that are proven safe and effective for reducing and eliminating depression in children.
 Talk with your child's pediatrician or other mental health providers about the best treatment option for your child. 
If you are unsure if your child is depressed but have concerns, it is best to consult with his pediatrician. It can be difficult to know exactly what your child is thinking or feeling, but it is always better to be safe when it comes to the well-being of your child.

Separation anxiety disorder and depression share many symptoms. As a parent, you are probably familiar with separation anxiety—the feeling an infant experiences when separated from her caregivers, for example. You may be less familiar with separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and its relation to depression. This is not to be confused with seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
 
Your infant will likely experience some separation anxiety when you or other caregivers are out of sight. This is a normal developmental process and usually begins around eight months and lasts through the child's second year.﻿﻿ For an infant, when you are out of sight, you are gone forever. As your infant matures, she will learn through experience that you will return and she will begin to be more comfortable with separations.
 For some children, however, the thought of you or another caregiver leaving them is so overwhelming that they will do what they can to avoid separation. 
This is a separation anxiety disorder. In order for it to be diagnosed, symptoms must be severe enough to interfere with a child's daily functioning for at least four weeks.﻿﻿ When a child starts to miss out on important things such as school and social activities to avoid a separation, it is considered to be SAD. SAD affects approximately 4% to 5% of children.﻿﻿
 
Research has indicated that a high rate of children who develop SAD later develop a depressive disorder.﻿﻿ With such a strong correlation between SAD and depression, it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of both disorders and to seek out early treatment for your child.
 
According to Dr. Peter M. Lewinsohn, PhD, who published a study of SAD in The Journal of The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the underlying fear of a child with SAD is that he or his parent will be harmed, lost or gone forever as a result of the separation.﻿﻿
 
Additional symptoms of SAD may be:﻿﻿
 
In Lewinsohn's long-term study of children with SAD, he estimated that 75% of children with SAD developed depression by the age of 30.﻿﻿ Though research hasn't proven that SAD is the cause of depression in these children, the association between the two is a substantial one.
 
SAD and depression actually share many symptoms. Clinging to a parent, refusing to go to school and avoiding social activities, worrying that harm may come to self or a parent, and vague physical complaints such as a headache, bellyache, and general pain are common symptoms of both disorders.
 
Again, the research findings do not suggest that all children with SAD will experience depression. Nor does it confirm why such a large number of children with SAD go on to develop depression. But given the findings, it is important for parents and clinicians to keep a close eye out for any depressive symptoms in children with SAD.
 
Keep an eye out for additional signs of depression in children, including unexplained crying, feeling misunderstood, withdrawing from family or peers, losing interest in things of former interest, sleeping difficulties, appetite and weight changes, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, and thoughts or actions of self-harm.﻿﻿
 
Try talking to your child when they are at an age-appropriate level. Find out what they are scared of and why they don't want to leave you. What you hear may surprise you. Your child may have a simple complaint, which you can easily remedy. If it is something more serious (they are worried they will never see you again, for instance), you should consult with your child's physician.
 A recent tragic event, such as an earthquake or the death of a loved one, may temporarily disrupt your child's sense of security. 
In this case, providing your child with some extra attention may ease his anxiety.
 
Prepare them for an upcoming event or separation. Explaining what will be happening, who will be there, how long he will be away from you and how he can reach you may help him feel more comfortable with separation.
 
If your efforts, support, and compassion do not seem to be helping your child adjust to even short separations, you should consult with your child's physician.
 
If you notice any symptoms of depression in your child, it is important to seek help. Depression is associated with serious short- and long-term consequences such as poor self-esteem, poor academic performance, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.﻿﻿
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Remember, your child may go through phases when he is more in need of your attention and love, especially during times of significant stress or tragedy. However, given the high rate of depression in children with SAD, it is best to check with a physician if you have any concerns about your child's behavior.

If you think that your child is depressed, it is important to look carefully at your child's symptoms. Depression symptoms can sometimes appear differently in a child as opposed to an adult, so it can sometimes be tough to spot the signs. Knowing what to look for can help you identify signs of depression so you can seek help.
 
Symptoms of depression in children tend to be a bit different than those for adults. Where low mood and loss of pleasure are often the two primary symptoms in adults with depression, kids are more likely to experience primary symptoms such as irritability and physical complaints.﻿﻿
 
Other symptoms of childhood depression include difficulty focusing and making decisions, extreme shyness, clinging to a parent, feeling hopeless, unexplained physical complaints, sleeping problems, appetite changes, and thoughts or actions of self-harm.
 If your child or someone else you know is having thoughts of suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you suspect that your child might be depressed, keep an eye out for the following signs.
 
Children may become sad about many things such as lost relationships, school work, failures, missing out on something, moving, or loss of a friend, pet, or loved one. Try to identify what your child is sad about and provide support. If symptoms of sadness improve or disappear after just a few days, they are probably not related to depression.﻿﻿
 
Depressed children may have a general sense of sadness about their life and their future, or they may not be able to identify what they are sad about. They may cry a lot or tear up frequently for no obvious reason. Feelings of sadness that last longer than two weeks are a reason to talk to your child's pediatrician.
 
Most children will change friends at some point and spend varying amounts of time with their parents. As children go through puberty, they naturally pull away from their families and start identifying more with peers. This is an important developmental step that should not be confused with social withdrawal.
 
When social withdrawal is associated with depression, it can contribute to a child's negative social experiences, which can reinforce depressive symptoms (such as worthlessness or feeling like no one likes or understands them).﻿﻿
 Children who are depressed may dramatically pull away from friends, family, and others who they were once close to.﻿﻿ They tend to keep to themselves and avoid interactions altogether. They may stop participating in class, social, and extracurricular activities. 
Your child may naturally lose interest in things they once loved, like a favorite toy or TV show, or suddenly declare that they no longer want to engage in a favorite activity. This is different from a child with depression.
 
A depressed child has a hard time finding joy or excitement in anything.﻿﻿ Your child may be indifferent to almost everything. Kids who are depressed often seem like they are just going through the motions without any joy or pleasure in what they are doing.
 
Every child will feel misunderstood at some point in time. A depressed child may feel that there is no one who can understand their feelings or that it is pointless to even try to talk about them. Your child may fear trying new things, speaking out, or sharing ideas out of fear of rejection, misinterpretation, or ridicule.﻿﻿
 
Children may have academic highs and lows over time. Remember that during times of transition to middle school or high school, course work may become more challenging.
 
A depressed child may have a significant decline in grades.﻿﻿ Missing school, trouble paying attention, or simply failing to do work are all reasons for such declines in grades. This may be more apparent in a child who had been a high academic achiever in the past.
 
Everyone gets tired, especially after busy days, hard work, late nights, illnesses, and exercise, but a depressed child may seem to always lack energy and motivation.﻿﻿
 Even after an appropriate amount of sleep, a depressed child may complain of being tired, move slowly, or take a disproportionate amount of time to complete a task. 
Feelings of excessive and unrelenting guilt are common in children with depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, and dysthymia.﻿﻿ A child with depression may blame themselves for anything that goes wrong, even if it is out of their control.
 
Guilt can also contribute to feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and hopelessness. If your child's guilt seems to be worsening, lasts longer than two weeks, and is present with other signs of depression, seek out your doctor or mental health professional.
 
Children with depressive disorders may feel worthless frequently or for long periods of time, especially following a negative event. Children who experience feelings of worthlessness typically think they are weak, inadequate, or flawed.
 
Children who feel worthless may believe that they are inherently bad and that everything they do is wrong.﻿﻿ They may not put any effort into their schoolwork, engage in unstable relationships, or not even try to connect with others because they believe that their efforts will fail or cause additional problems.
 
Feelings of worthlessness or other symptoms of depression for more than a week or two may require treatment from your child's pediatrician or mental health provider.
 
For some depressed children and adolescents, their emotions may cause them to feel angry toward the people or things that they believe are the sources of their pain. This can lead to impulsive and aggressive reactions.
 
Impulsive behaviors are quick reactions to events (usually negative) without regard for consequences. Impulsive behaviors often, but do not always, lead to aggressive actions. Aggressive behaviors may be directed inward in the form of self-injury, or at someone or something else through angry outbursts, harassment, property damage, or violence.﻿﻿
 
Childhood depression is a complex condition that has many causes. A number of different factors can contribute to the onset of depression in kids. Depression affects many children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 3.2% of kids between the ages of 3 and 17 have been diagnosed with depression.﻿﻿
 
Some of the risk factors that can contribute to childhood depression include:
 
If you think that your child may be depressed, consult with your pediatrician, who can evaluate the symptoms, rule out an underlying medical illness, and recommend the appropriate treatment.
 
Here are a few things that you can do to help your child cope with feelings of depression.
 
Watch for symptoms such as sadness, irritability, loss of pleasure, change of appetite, change of sleep habits, tiredness, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death. Talk to a health professional if your child shows such signs.
 
Let your child know that depression is nothing to be ashamed of; depression is an illness just like the flu and getting the right treatment can help kids get better.
 
Give your child the right to have these feelings. Children can easily get the idea that it's not OK to feel depressed and start to hide their feelings rather than deal with them in a healthy way.
 
Kids need to know that there will be help available when they need it. Give them a list of people they may talk to such as yourself, a teacher, or a counselor.
 
It may seem small to you, but what counts is how it feels to your child. Listen and be a source of support.
 
Be aware of the impact your own responses to life are having on your child. Your child learns coping skills by watching you.
 
It can be difficult to know whether your child is depressed or having a mild reaction to a negative event, but you are not alone. Many parents struggle with understanding what their child is thinking and feeling. Fortunately, there are many ways to find support and treatment.
 Family history: Having close family members and relatives with depression increases the risk of experiencing childhood depression. One 30-year study found that those with the highest risk of depression were those with two previous generations of family members with depression.﻿﻿ Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine can play a role in causing depression. Stress: Life events such as moving and divorce can play a role in causing childhood depression. Environment: A chaotic or unstable home life can be a risk factor for depression, as can experiencing social isolation or bullying at school. Physical health: Health conditions, particularly chronic illnesses such as type 1 diabetes, can increase the risk of experiencing childhood depression.﻿﻿",information present article may trigger

Chances are that your family has at least one computer, tablet, or smartphone with Internet access that your child uses for fun and learning. While you may be vigilant about monitoring your child's use and restricting access to inappropriate content, you may not be aware that Internet bullying, also known as cyberbullying, can occur through simple emails, instant messages, or posts and comments created by others.
 
Like other forms of bullying, serious consequences like depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior have been linked to cyberbullying, according to Dr. Jeff Hutchinson, an adolescent medicine specialist in Washington, D.C. Fortunately, your awareness and vigilance can keep your child safe from cyberbullying.
 
Victims of cyberbullying can experience symptoms of depression including sadness, loneliness, insecurity, poor self-esteem, academic decline, feelings of not belonging, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.
 If your child is struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Nancy Willard, author of ""Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats: Responding to the Challenge of Online Social Aggression, Threats, and Distress,"" writes that the effects of cyberbullying may be more damaging than in-school bullying because cyberbullied children do not have the opportunity to escape the harassment. Due to the anonymous nature of some Internet harassment, victims may not be able to identify their harasser and feel that everyone is against them.
 
On the flip side, research has shown that perpetrators of childhood cyberbullying are likely to be facing concurrent behavioral and psychosocial challenges, meaning that youth internet harassment might be a marker for other issues.﻿﻿
 
Dr. Michele Ybarra and colleagues published a study on Internet harassment among children in 2007 that found that approximately 9% of children in their study who used the Internet were victims of some form of Internet harassment.﻿﻿
 
In their study, the researchers found that only half of the victims knew their harasser and that boys and girls were equally involved.
 Approximately 25% of children who were cyberbullied were also bullied in a different setting. 
Interestingly, they found that the odds of being harassed online increased significantly for those who also harassed others.
 
According to experts, there are two main types of cyberbullying: direct and by proxy.
 
Direct Internet attacks occur when a bully shows aggression toward another person directly either through email, instant messaging, chat rooms, or social posts. This can range from insulting comments to threats of physical violence.
 
Cyberbullying by proxy, on the other hand, occurs when a person uses another person's email address or username or creates an imposter account to harass a victim. The bully may contact everyone in their address book to spread lies, hateful messages, or reveal contact or personal information about the victim. In some cases, websites dedicated to harassing and bashing a person have been created. In the case of cyberbullying by proxy, the victim may not be able to identify who the harasser is.
 
While the effects of cyberbullying can leave parents feeling helpless, there are things you can do to prepare and protect your child from experiencing or perpetrating it.
 
First and foremost, talk to your children about appropriate Internet behavior, your family rules for Internet use, and discuss consequences for misuse. Enforce consequences when the rules are broken by taking away devices or turning off internet access when necessary.
 
Monitor your child's Internet use and time spent on devices. Keeping the computer in a common area may decrease the temptation to engage in inappropriate activity. Dr. Parry Aftab, attorney and children's advocate for safe Internet use, suggests searching for your child's name on the Internet to make sure negative or false information has not been posted, or that your child is not linked to harassing content.
 
If bullying behavior, harassment, or misuse is identified, notify the website or application's administration immediately to see if they can help launch an investigation into the incident. Contact the police if your child is being contacted or harassed by an adult, if any threats are made against your child, or if efforts to stop the harassment have failed. Notifying your child's school about cyberbullying may also be effective when the bully can be identified.
 
If you notice symptoms of depression in your child, consult with their pediatrician. Their doctor can determine whether your child has clinical depression and recommend the appropriate treatment.

There is a difference between addiction, physical dependence, and tolerance to pain medication. It is imperative that each of us understands the difference.
 
Many people with chronic pain conditions, including certain types of arthritis, are prescribed pain medication. Their medical condition dictates the need for such drugs—that's why it was prescribed as part of their treatment plan. Yet, if you pay attention to the news, people who are legitimately prescribed pain medication are being lumped in with the abusers. We can easily understand how that developed. After all, there is an epidemic of opioid abuse in the U.S. The drugs are said to be overprescribed. Add to that a celebrity dying from a drug overdose and the anti-drug campaigns hit a fever pitch.
 
Each of the aforementioned problems is a legitimate concern. But, so is the disregard for people (e.g., chronic pain patients) who legitimately need pain medication to function and have some quality of life. Their plight cannot be minimized while the urgency of other matters is dealt with. This realization has largely been lost because too many people do not understand the difference between addiction, physical dependence, and tolerance. We cannot blur the lines between these three factors and expect to solve problems related to drug use and abuse. It is the first step we all must take—understanding the terminology. 
 
The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), and the American Pain Society (APS) recognize the following definition of addiction as it relates to the use of opioids for the treatment of pain:
 
Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.
 Addiction is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. 
The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), and the American Pain Society (APS) recognize the following definition of physical dependence:
 
Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.
 
The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), and the American Pain Society (APS) recognize the following definition of tolerance:
 
Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution (i.e., diminishing or lessening) of one or more of the drug's effects over time.
 
That said, most pain medicine and addiction specialists concur that chronic pain patients treated longterm with opioid drugs usually do develop physical dependence. Some patients will develop tolerance. But, usually, this group of patients does not develop an addiction. The actual risk of addiction is considered unknown and not predictable, but it is likely related to several factors, including genetic predisposition.
 
Addiction itself is a primary chronic disease. Exposure to drugs is just one factor in its development. In fact, in most cases, exposure to drugs that can stimulate the brain's reward center do not produce addiction.
 
Impaired control, craving, and compulsive use of the drug, as well as continued use of the drug despite negative physical, mental, or social consequences, are considered characteristic features of addiction. But, it can be a bit more complicated than simply recognizing the presence of those features. The same features could be related to inadequate pain relief. A doctor must be able to exercise their judgment and to discern between addiction and another cause.
 
There are specific behaviors that point to the possibility of addiction. Those behaviors include:
 
Addiction clearly is associated with potentially serious, even fatal, consequences. On the other hand, physical dependence is considered a normal response by the body to the chronic or continued use of certain medications—and not only opioid pain medications. For example, physical dependence can occur with corticosteroids, antidepressants, beta-blockers, as well as other medications not considered addictive. If drugs that may be associated with physical dependence are to be discontinued, the drug should be tapered to avoid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., prednisone tapering).
 
Tolerance is even a bit trickier to understand. Tolerance may occur to the desired effect of the drug, but it can also occur to the undesired effects. Tolerance is also variable, occurring at different rates for different effects. Using opioids as an example, tolerance to the analgesic effects occur more slowly than to respiratory depression.
 
Addiction is mostly a behavioral disorder, although it can overlap with physical dependence. Typically, addiction involves using the drug despite negative consequences, craving the drug even when not in physical pain, and using it for reasons other than the prescribed indication. Physical dependence is evident when someone develops a tolerance to a drug or if one would experience withdrawal symptoms from stopping the drug suddenly. Tolerance is present when the same dose does not garner the same result, thereby requiring higher doses to achieve the desired result. In and of itself, physical dependence does not mean that there is addiction, but it may accompany addiction when there is addiction.

A rebound effect, a crash, and a comedown are all drug after-effects that cause different symptoms. It is important to understand each condition and how each set of symptoms plays a role in addiction.
 
A rebound effect is what happens when the body tries to bring itself back into balance (a condition known as homeostasis) after a drug has been taken, by creating physical symptoms that are the opposite to those caused by the drug.
 
Understanding the rebound effect explains why certain drugs, particularly those that have a quick and intense effect on the nervous system, are very addictive. One of the ironies of addiction is that the rebound effect causes the person taking the drug to experience the very same effects they were hoping to escape through drug use.
 
This is especially true if the person wants to maintain the state such as wishing to stay awake or alert for longer than the effects of the stimulant or trying to sleep or relax for longer than the effects of the depressant, sedative, or tranquilizer.
 
For example, when you take a sedative drug, which causes relaxation and drowsiness, a rebound effect of agitation will occur after the drug wears off, making you want to take more of the sedative drug in order to calm down. This can actually worsen the risk of developing an addiction, as people seek to recapture the effects they experienced after taking the drug.
 
Pain is also intensified during a rebound from a painkiller, such as an opioid medication, or a street drug, such as heroin. The pain can be physical, emotional, or a combination of the two. Physical and emotional pain often go hand-in-hand, so it is easy to see how painkiller addiction develops.
 
The ""comedown"" is the feeling of the effects of a drug gradually wearing off, after a period of intoxication. It is often described as ""coming down"" from the drug ""high."" The experience varies depending on the person, the amount of drug taken, as well as how long and how often the person has been using the drug.
 
If the intoxication experience was too intense and made the person who took the drug feel uncomfortable, anxious, or delusional, the comedown can feel relatively pleasant, while for others, the comedown can be a disappointing sensation, signaling a return to reality and perhaps triggering further drug use.
 
If you feel ill during a comedown, you may be having medical complications in reaction to the drug. If these persist, it is important to be evaluated for emotional or psychological symptoms, especially if they involve thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, and psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices.
 
Make sure you tell them what you have taken, how much, and when. It is better to get early intervention than suffer greater complications later on.
 
The ""crash"" is the intense exhaustion that people sometimes feel after using drugs, particularly those that are stimulating, such as cocaine, meth, and even high doses of caffeine. It involves helping the body recover not only from the toxicity and effects of the drugs, but also from any overexertion, lack of sleep, injuries, or other harms that potentially occurred during intoxication.
 
This crash can last much longer than the original high because the body needs longer to recover from the effects of the substance and other behaviors that may have affected the drug user, such as lack of sleep.
 
The most intense and unpleasant crash is typically experienced by people who use crack cocaine. The drug can be taken for several days at a time, often with increasing agitation and paranoia, before experiencing a crash several days of recovery. People who snort cocaine can experience the same pattern, but with less intensity than crack cocaine.
 
Experts consider the short, intense high coupled with the rapid onset of the crash, which is lifted by more of the drug, to explain why nicotine and crack cocaine are so addictive.﻿﻿
 
If you stop taking drugs, you may experience withdrawal fatigue. Withdrawal is the physical and emotional experience that occurs when a drug is discontinued after a period of continuous or excessive use.
 
Regardless of the drug taken, fatigue is a trademark symptom of withdrawal. Even if the drug was a relaxing substance, the inability to relax and sleep will lead to the person feeling more tired than usual. In fact, it may be even more difficult for someone recovering from a sedative drug to sleep than for someone who took a stimulant, who may be able to crash for days.
 
Research has shown that people withdrawing from alcohol have sleep disturbances, poor sleep quality, and do not function well during the day for a month after discontinuing drinking.﻿﻿ They also experience considerable psychological distress during this time.
 
Withdrawal fatigue is exhausting, but people often try and keep going at their usual pace. This is not a good idea, as it will take longer to restore energy and return to normal activities. Fatigue is your body's way of getting you to rest and recuperate.
 
Allow your body to recover by following these tips:
 
If you don't start to feel your energy return after a week or so of rest, see your doctor. Many people who use alcohol and drugs often have an underlying depressive disorder or other mood disorders.﻿﻿ Sometimes, by getting proper treatment for the depression, people find that their substance use problems improve and they can quit.
 
However, some withdrawal symptoms can actually make mental illness symptoms like anxiety, depression, sex difficulties, sleep problems, and psychosis worse.﻿﻿ These are known as substance-induced disorders. An addiction specialist is the best person to diagnose and treat your condition, but if you don't have access to a specialist, talk it over with another healthcare provider.
 
Everyone's recovery experience is different. The good news is that most people who stop using drugs and alcohol regain energy, sometimes in as little as a few weeks.
 
Of course, how quickly you recover depends on many factors, such as your overall health, the type of substance used, how much, and how often you were using the substance. Lifestyle and emotional factors, such as whether you are living in a supportive environment, and whether you feel safe with the people around you, can also affect your recovery.
 
If you are not living with or near people who support you, it will be more difficult to regain your energy after substance use. If you are in an abusive relationship, it is unlikely you will feel alright until you get away from the abuser. No matter how much sleep you get, living with someone who hurts you emotionally or physically is exhausting.
 
If this is the case for you, reach out for help. There are many resources available to help you and your children to make a fresh start. In the long term, nothing will be better for your energy than a drug-free, anxiety-free lifestyle. Your doctor or local police can help you if you are living with or feel controlled by someone you are in a relationship with.

Take a break. Take a break from your usual activities—don't go out socializing for a few days. Call in sick to work or school if you have to. Even if it is self-inflicted, you are not well enough to be up and about. Learn relaxation techniques. Practicing relaxation skills are very useful, and if you can, get enough sleep. Develop a relaxing bedtime routine. If you can't sleep, try and do restful activities during the night, and, unless you are fully asleep, get up, bathe, dress, and eat during the daytime. This will help reset your body clock, which may have been affected by you not sleeping and waking at the usual times while you were using drugs. Consume a healthy, well-balanced diet. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and protein, aids in the recovery process. If you don't have access to fresh food, talk to a pharmacist about the right amount of vitamin supplements. Vitamin C helps heal wounds, and vitamin B complex may help curb nicotine cravings.",rebound effect crash comedown drug effect cause different symptoms important understand condition set symptoms play

When a parent of a grandchild misuses drugs or alcohol, grandparents are put in a terrible position. Of course, a grandparent's first instinct is to try to fix things, but substance abuse can be an intractable problem. Often, grandparents must settle for doing everything possible for their grandchildren, but even that course of action has risks.
 
Grandparents who love their grandchildren think that they deserve parents who do not misuse drugs or alcohol, and this is true. All children deserve parents who are fully there for them. Parents are not perfect, though, and can struggle with a variety of issues. Unless a child is being injured or neglected, a parent's substance use disorder is unlikely to qualify as child abuse. This is especially likely to be true when there is another parent in the family who ensures that children get appropriate care or when a parent's drug misuse does not occur when he or she is in charge of the children. 
 
That said, studies do show that a parent with a substance use disorder is three times more likely to physically or sexually abuse their child than a parent who does not misuse drugs.﻿﻿
 
Some steps that grandparents can take are obvious ones. They can make sure that the grandchildren know that they have people in their lives who they can talk to about what they're going through. Ensure that they know there are people who love them and will see that they are taken care of. They can nurture their relationship with their grandchildren so that if they ever have to take over their care, the children won't feel that they are being turned over to strangers. They can create opportunities for the grandchildren to be with extended family, to get to know aunts, uncles, and cousins. Those family members also often step in during family crises.
 
Pointing out a parent's faults is seldom productive. Even children who know that a parent has a substance abuse problem want to believe the best about their parent. Hearing a grandparent verbally attack a parent is likely to cause problems in the grandparent-grandchild relationship. In addition, parents can be quick to cut off grandparents who are perceived as working against them. The most essential thing that grandparents must do is to preserve contact with their grandchildren. 
 
Sometimes grandparents struggle with staying quiet, feeling that they must take a stand when parents engage in unwise and destructive behavior. Doing otherwise feels inauthentic and wrong. Speaking up about someone's drug or alcohol habit seldom changes anything, however. If only it were that easy! And staying quiet does not constitute an endorsement of their behavior.
 
If grandchildren bring up the topic, however, grandparents may take advantage of the opening to discuss the dangers of substance abuse in a way that is age-appropriate. It is still best, however, to refrain from placing blame. 
 
Parental substance abuse can have a wide-ranging impact on families. Often, there are economic consequences, as the parent can have difficulty holding a job or may miss work. Sometimes children are given basic care but don't get help with homework, health routines, grooming, or other non-essential but important items.﻿﻿ 
 
In the case of economic struggles, grandparents are put in a no-win situation. If they readily step in with economic aid, they may be enabling a parent's habit by making it possible for them to spend even more money on alcohol or drugs. The usual money mistakes that grandparents sometimes make with adult children can have a greater impact when substance abuse is in the picture. Generally speaking, it may be best if grandparents bail out the parents only when not doing so will have a direct and detrimental impact on the grandchildren.
 
Even when parents struggle with substance use disorders, they often still see themselves as loving parents and want to fill the parental role. Thus, it is important for grandparents not to overstep boundaries. A grandparent who is afraid that there is no money for school clothes, for example, can offer to take the grandchildren shopping and can even include the parent in the excursion. This is a far better solution than just buying clothes for the children without asking the parents or allowing them to have input.
 
Children whose parents abuse drugs or alcohol may suffer a variety of emotional effects. These include:﻿﻿
 
Statistics also show that children of substance abusers have an increased risk of developing a substance use disorder themselves due to genetic and environmental factors.﻿﻿ Still, the presence of loving grandparents can be a positive force working against the repetition of the cycle.
 
Substance abuse in a family also affects a child's psychological and social functioning.﻿﻿ Children feel at fault or feel that they must try to fix things. When children react in this way, they often feel a lot of pressure. They may feel that they must be perfect in every way. Grandparents can help by taking any opportunity to point out that the situation is not their fault and that they do not have the power to fix it. They can encourage their grandchildren to do their best but let them know that it's also okay to mess up occasionally.
 
At other times, children under-perform or act out. This is a more difficult syndrome for grandparents to handle. They can try to stave off academic difficulties. There are many ways that grandparents can support their grandchildren in school. A truly troubled child, however, will need counseling or therapy. Grandparents can sometimes get parents to agree to such measures if they refrain from tying the child's behavior to a parent's substance abuse.
 
Children whose parents misuse alcohol or drugs are often reluctant to bring friends home. This reluctance can impact their social development. Grandparents can help by sometimes including their grandchildren's friends in outings and visits. This is a practice that needs to be developed early on, however. If grandparents don't include friends when their grandchildren are young, it's unlikely to work when they try to include the friends of tween or teen grandchildren. Yes, many grandparents would prefer to have their grandchildren all to themselves rather than sharing time with their friends. Still, what is best for the grandchildren should be the controlling factor.
 
Although substance abuse on the part of a parent doesn't automatically qualify as child abuse, abuse can occur when a parent is under the influence. Children can also experience neglect, usually defined as a failure to provide food, clothing, shelter, or medical care. Neglect can also occur when parents fail to protect children from risk.﻿﻿
 
Grandparents who know that grandchildren are being abused or neglected are legally and morally bound to report the situation, even if it is the grandparent's own child who is at fault. Sometimes, however, grandparents are unsure whether a situation really qualifies as abuse or neglect. Every state has an abuse hotline, and those who man the phone lines can often offer clarification. Sometimes reports can also be made online.
 
Although reports can be made anonymously, it is best when callers provide their names and contact information so that they can be asked for further information or verification. One's identity can be kept confidential.
 
In the case that children must be removed from the home, most grandparents will want to be contacted so that they can be involved in care decisions. In fact, a 2008 act ensures that grandparents have that right.﻿﻿ Many grandparents in this situation end up raising grandchildren, either as official foster parents or in a more informal custodial placement.
 
Of course, grandparents who report abuse run the risk of being cut off from grandchildren, especially if the agency decides that the children are not at risk. Even if a report is anonymous or confidential, parents may correctly deduce the identity of the reporter. Also, parents sometimes simply withdraw from contact with any outside parties. They may even move to avoid contact with protective services. Still, if grandchildren are truly at risk, grandparents have no choice.
 
When grandchildren are in a bad situation, grandparents suffer, too. When grandchildren live with someone who misuses drugs, grandparents may feel that it is their fault. If the person is their own child, they may feel responsible in some way. If the person misusing drugs is the spouse, they may feel that they should have opposed the relationship.
 
The truth is that individuals are responsible for their own decisions. Second-guessing every decision that one made as a parent is unproductive and will only cause additional problems.
 
One of the best strategies for grandparents dealing with a family member who misuses drugs is to live the best life they can. By caring for themselves physically and emotionally, grandparents will offer their grandchildren positive role models. They will convey that life is full of possibilities. They will be physically and emotionally able to offer their grandchildren a safe place when it is sorely needed.
 Ambivalence: Children typically love their parents, even when they may dislike the way alcohol or drugs make them behave. Confusion: Children of substance abusers never know what to expect, because they never know when a parent is going to be under the influence. Lack of trust: Because alcoholics and substance abusers often promise and fail to deliver, children sometimes grow up feeling that they can't trust anyone. Guilt: Substance abusers often blame their behavior on other family members. It's only natural for children to wonder if they are at fault, even when they are not named. Shame: Since it's natural to identify with family members, children may take the shame of addiction on themselves.  Worry: Once children reach a certain age, they realize that substance abuse has consequences, including accidents and run-ins with the law. They may worry that their parent will be incarcerated or die. They may also know that abusers sometimes lose their parental rights, and they may worry about losing their family.",parent grandchild misuse drug alcohol grandparents put terrible position course

Addiction is a complex, chronic brain condition influenced by genes and the environment that is characterized by substance use or compulsive actions that continue despite harmful consequences.﻿﻿
 
For a long time, addiction meant an uncontrollable habit of using alcohol or other drugs. More recently, the concept of addiction has expanded to include behaviors, such as gambling, as well as substances, and even ordinary and necessary activities, such as exercise and eating.
 
While addiction to substances has often appeared clear-cut, there's some controversy about what substances are truly addictive. Current guidelines in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the diagnostic tool used to diagnose different types of mental health conditions, indicate that most psychoactive substances, including medications, have the potential to be addictive.
 
The term addiction is used to describe compulsive drug-seeking behaviors that continue in spite of negative outcomes, but it is important to note that addiction is not considered an official diagnosis in the DSM-5.﻿﻿
 
Rather than using the term ""addiction,"" the DSM-5 classifies substance use disorders. While the diagnostic criteria vary for each type, the DSM-5 describes these disorders as a problematic pattern of use of intoxicating substances that leads to significant impairment and distress. These symptoms can result in impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and tolerance/withdrawal. 
 
While these conditions might be informally referred to as addictions, your doctor will officially diagnose you with some form of substance use disorder or one of the two behavioral addiction disorders that are officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).
 
There are different substance use disorders found in the DSM-5:﻿﻿
 
The DSM-5 also recognizes two types of behavioral addiction:
 There is still much debate about whether many behavioral addictions are “true” addictions. More research is needed to clarify this issue. While shopping addiction, sex addiction, and exercise addiction are often noted as behavioral addictions, the DSM-5 does not officially recognize these as distinct disorders. 
The signs and symptoms vary from one addiction type to another, but some common symptoms of addiction include:
 Two aspects that all addictions have in common: 
It is important to distinguish between dependence and addiction. When people become dependent on a substance, it means that they experience drug tolerance and drug withdrawal:
 
A person can become dependent on a drug without being addicted, although the two often occur together. Addiction occurs when people continue to compulsively use a drug despite harmful consequences.﻿﻿
 
Addiction diagnosis usually requires recognizing that there is a problem and seeking help. Substance use is not always an indication of addiction, although drug use carries numerous health and social risks in addition to the risk of addiction.
 
Once a person has decided that they have a problem and need help, the next step is an examination by a healthcare professional. This involves questions about behaviors or substance use, an examination to assess overall health, and the development of a treatment plan that works best for the individual's specific addiction. 
 
The exact diagnosis a person receives will depend on the nature of their addiction. Commonly misused substances that can lead to addiction include:
 
Because some substances have the potential to cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms, it is important to receive an appropriate diagnosis in order to get the best treatment.
 
It is common, if not normal, to go through a stage of engaging in substance use or an addictive behavior without believing you are addicted. This is so common, in fact, that it has a name, the pre-contemplation stage.
 
If you are starting to think you might have an addiction, you have probably moved into the contemplation stage. This is a great time to find out more about the substance or behavior that you have been engaging in and to reflect honestly on whether you are experiencing any signs or symptoms of addiction.
 
Many people then decide to make changes. For some people, this is easy and manageable. For many others, quitting can lead to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, even with behaviors, and can open up uncomfortable feelings that were being soothed or suppressed by the addictive behavior.
 
If this happens, or if you have been drinking or using drugs, such as opioids—illicit or prescribed, other prescription medications, stimulants, cocaine, or meth—you should seek medical help immediately.
 Stopping some drugs then relapsing can heighten your risk of overdose, mental health problems, or other life-threatening medical complications, and should be done under medical supervision. 
Substances and behaviors can create a physical and psychological high. Over time, people develop a tolerance, meaning it takes more of something to achieve those same initial effects. Some of the factors that can contribute to addiction include:
 
Addictions take time to develop. It is unlikely that a person will become addicted after using a substance once, although it is possible to develop a mental health problem or to die of an overdose or another complication after one use of some substances.
 
Addiction is treatable, but not all routes to recovery are the same. Relapses are not uncommon, so the journey may take time.﻿﻿ Some of the common treatment approaches that may be used include:
 
Although there are some schools of thought that stress the need for complete abstinence, many people are able to learn to control addictive behaviors, such as drinking, eating, shopping, and sex. The approach that will be best for you depends on many factors and is best decided in collaboration with your doctor or therapist.﻿﻿
 
In addition to getting appropriate treatment, there are things that you can do that will make it easier to cope and aid in your recovery.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

Many people fear the term addiction and believe it is an indication of failure or worthlessness. People with addictions often carry stigma about their behavior, leading to shame and fear of seeking help. The world is changing, and you may find that getting help for your addiction is the best thing you ever do for yourself. In the meantime, we hope that educating yourself will help on your journey to wellness.
 Alcohol-related disorders Caffeine-related disorders Cannabis-related disorders Hallucinogen-related disorders Opioid-related disorders Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related disorders Stimulant-related disorders Tobacco-related disorders Gambling addiction Internet gaming disorder An inability to stop Changes in mood, appetite, and sleep Continuing despite negative consequences Denial Engaging in risky behaviors Feeling preoccupied with the substance or behavior Legal and financial problems Losing interest in other things you used to enjoy Putting the substance or behavior ahead of other parts of life including family, work, and other responsibilities Secrecy Using increasingly larger amounts of a substance Taking more of the substance than you intended Withdrawal symptoms The addictive behavior is maladaptive. The behavior causes problems for the individual or those around them. So instead of helping the person cope with situations or overcome problems, it tends to undermine these abilities. The behavior is persistent. When people are addicted, they will continue to engage in the addictive behavior despite the trouble it causes. So an occasional weekend of self-indulgence is not an addiction, although it may cause different kinds of problems. Addiction is characterized by frequent engagement in the behavior. Tolerance means that the body has adapted to the presence of the drug so that it takes more of the drug to produce the same effects. Withdrawal occurs when people experience certain physical and psychological symptoms if the use of the substance is suddenly decreased or halted. Alcohol Cocaine Hallucinogens Inhalants Marijuana MDMA and other club drugs Methamphetamine Opioids﻿﻿ Prescription drugs Steroids Tobacco/nicotine The brain: Addiction leads to changes in the brain's reward circuits over time. Family history: You may be more likely to become addicted if you have family members who also have addictions. Genetics: Research suggests that genetics increases the likelihood of developing an addiction.﻿﻿ Environment: Exposure to addictive substances, social pressure, lack of social support, and poor coping skills can also contribute to the development of addictions. Psychotherapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be used to address thought and behavior patterns that contribute to addictions. Other therapies that might be used including contingency management, family therapy, and group therapy.﻿﻿ Medications: This may include medications to help treat craving and withdrawal symptoms as well as other drugs to treat underlying mental disorders such as anxiety or depression. Medications that may be prescribed include methadone, buprenorphine, nicotine replacement therapies, and naltrexone. Hospitalization: In some cases, people may need to be hospitalized in order to treat potentially serious complications while they detox from a substance. Support groups and self-help: In-person and online support groups can be a great resource for education and social support as people learn new ways to cope during recovery. Recognize the signs. Often people’s addictions become ingrained in their lifestyle, to the point where they never or rarely feel withdrawal symptoms. Or they may not recognize their withdrawal symptoms for what they are, putting them down to aging, working too hard, or just not liking mornings. People can go for years without realizing how dependent they are on their addiction. Learn about addiction. Remember help is always available. Educating yourself is a good start. You can greatly reduce the amount of harm to yourself and those around you, and maybe one day, you will be ready to change for good. Develop coping skills. The harm caused by addiction is particularly difficult to recognize when addiction is the person’s main way of coping with other problems. Sometimes other problems are directly related to the addiction, such as health problems, and sometimes they are indirectly related to the addiction, for example, relationship problems. Developing new coping skills can help you handle life's stresses without relying on substances or behaviors. Get support. Social support from friends and family is important. Joining a support group can be a great way to connect with people with shared experiences.",addiction complex chronic brain condition influence genes environment characterize substance use compulsive

Being sober doesn't have to mean giving up your social life, yet managing sobriety in a social setting (especially when alcohol is involved) can be a bit of a challenge. You may have a lot of concerns about going out after quitting drinking.
 
If you're in early recovery, you'll want to stay away from any situation where alcohol or drugs are involved for some time. These environments can trigger cravings and put you at risk of relapse.
 
If you have decided to cut back on alcohol for your health, or you're more established in your sobriety, social environments that involve drinking may be easier to navigate. Still, being prepared and having a plan can help you enjoy going out after you’ve quit drinking.
 
It’s up to you to decide how much information to share and who to share it with. You certainly don’t have to justify your decision. Some people drink, and some people don’t. Everyone has their own choice to make, and no explanation is needed.
 If you have good friends who are likely to support your efforts, you might decide to have a direct and honest conversation with them. Tell them that you plan to avoid alcohol or that you’re cutting back. 
Let them know what they can do to help. Perhaps you’d appreciate a sober buddy, or someone else staying sober with you when you go out or helping you resist the temptation to drink. Or maybe you’d still like to hang out together, but not in bars. You might even still like to do the same things—such as playing cards or watching movies together—but without alcohol.
 
Hopefully, some of your friends will support your decision. In fact, some of them might also be thinking about cutting back on their own alcohol use and be inspired by you.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
While some of your friends may be totally supportive of your decision, others may seem indifferent or respond in a negative way. Your sobriety might serve as a reminder to your ""drinking buddies"" that they're consuming unhealthy amounts of alcohol, or stir up a bit of anxiety if they feel uncomfortable socializing sober. Or, they may simply want you to partake alongside them because they think you’ll all have more fun together when drinking.
 
Just knowing a few possible reactions will help ensure that you're not taken by surprise and you're able to cope:
 
It’s also important to be prepared for the long-term changes you might experience from your decision to quit drinking, including:
 
A change in your friendship dynamics doesn’t have to be a bad thing, however. You might find the shift welcoming. There’s always a chance that you’ll enjoy conversations with your friends more when you’re sober. And you may even find that they appreciate you more or respect your decisions.  
 And even if your friendships do change in a way that you don’t like, don’t despair. You might be able to create a new circle of friends, or simply decide to hang out with your old pals in different locations and times when alcohol isn’t the main focus. 
One of the easiest things you can do to avoid drinking—and to avoid having to explain yourself—is to go to places that don’t serve alcohol.
 
Coffee shops, movie theaters, museums, libraries, and fast-food restaurants are just a few places that aren’t likely to serve alcoholic beverages. Look for places in your community that are alcohol free—from farmer’s markets to local theaters, you’ll likely find plenty of spots that don’t serve alcohol.
 
You might go out alone as you start this new chapter of your life. Or, you might invite your friends to join you in these places as a way to encourage sober activities.
 
Obviously, you aren’t likely to avoid alcohol all the time. Weddings, shows, and even art galleries usually serve alcohol. And, of course, your friends may want to go to bars, clubs, or other events where alcohol is one of the main attractions.
 To be better prepared, it’s important to develop some go-to responses ahead of time for how you'll politely turn down a drink or handle questions about why you’re not drinking. 
Depending on your comfort level and the person asking, you might decide to offer a direct, truthful response. Here are some options:
 
Of course, you don’t need to explain yourself. A simple, “I’m drinking seltzer tonight,” is enough. But if you know your friends are likely to give you a hard time, or you know that you’re going to run into people who are going to insist you drink, having a few canned responses can prevent you from being taken off guard.
 
It’s helpful to have something in your hand at all times. So if you go to a place that serves alcohol, maybe you can immediately order a non-alcoholic drink.
 
If you go to someone’s home, bring your own drink. Whether you have bottled water or a protein shake with you, keeping a drink in your hand can prevent people from offering you alcohol. It will also help you decline more easily if you are offered a drink, because you can say, “No thanks, I already have one.”
 
When you walk into a situation believing that you can’t have fun sober, this is likely to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. You might even isolate yourself or hold back from having a good time—which will then reinforce your belief (and others) that being sober makes fun impossible.
 Enter into the situation with a positive attitude, and make the best of your time, even if you’re the only one not drinking. You might actually find that being sober is more enjoyable than you predicted. 
If you go out with people who are drinking and you’re not having fun, or you’re really tempted to drink yourself, then you'll want to leave early. This is especially important if you’re going somewhere where you used to always drink before. The bar or the same nightclub you used to frequent while drinking may be a trigger for you.
 
While you can just leave or say you have to go without offering a reason why, you might find it’s more helpful to have a scripted excuse to quickly get out of the situation. A few examples:
 
If you're in recovery and feel especially fragile or are craving alcohol even after you leave the environment, be sure to seek help. Call a trusted friend or family member or go to a meeting at a nearby support group.
 
You might find that one of the best parts about not drinking is that you don’t waste away the next morning sleeping and feeling hungover. So make the most of the time you gain by doing something enjoyable or productive.
 
Go for a jog, clean the house, or run errands. Then, take the rest of your day to enjoy your time. Having more time and energy might motivate you to continue abstaining from alcohol.
 
If your friends are up for trying things that don’t involve alcohol, then you can make some suggestions.
 
You might find that you get to know each other much better when you’re creating new memories—rather than standing around in the same old bars. They might have fun exploring new places and trying new things with you.
 
You may need to shift your social circle to include people who don’t drink. This may seem tough at first. If you’re surrounded by people who make alcohol a big part of their lives, it can feel like everyone drinks.
 
But in reality, there are plenty of people out there who don’t drink—and who are looking for friends who don’t drink. You just have to find them. You might need to try new activities so that you can meet sober people, including:
 
When you get together with such people, you’ll likely find that they do plenty of activities that don’t involve alcohol—like hiking, skiing, playing games, or fishing. And you might even find that you enjoy doing these types of things much more than activities that involve alcohol.
 
Consider every sober outing an experiment. You might make some mistakes—like drinking when you didn’t intend to or arguing with someone who offers you a drink. But you also might discover that you are happier when you aren’t drinking, or that you really enjoy conversations with people more when you’re sober.
 Learn from each experience. The information you take away can help you continue creating your best life. 
Regardless of why you decide to change your drinking habits, socializing sober can feel scary. If you find that you’re struggling to avoid alcohol, or you’re feeling lonely and isolated, consider seeking professional help. A therapist can support your efforts and help you find the strategies that work best for you, your health, and your life.
 Can I have fun without drinking?  How will my friends react?  Will I feel self-conscious without a little liquid courage?  ﻿Can I say ""no"" and stick to it? Nagging: Your friends may say things like, “Come on, can you please just have one drink to loosen up a little?” Teasing: You may get made fun of for being ""boring"" or ""lame."" Some friends might say you can’t handle your alcohol or that you’re getting too old to drink. Cajoling: Your friends might try to act as though they’re doing you a favor by buying you a drink, so you can “have fun.” Or, they may try to convince you that if you just have one drink, they won’t tell anyone. Peer pressure: Your pals might gang up on you a bit and try to talk you into having a drink. They may even pass out a round of shots and try to insist that you join in. Confrontation: An upset friend may even confront you and insist that your unwillingness to drink is a sign of something bigger, like a “controlling partner” or “a midlife crisis.” Being phased out of social situations: You may receive fewer social invitations over time once your friends realize that your decision not to drink isn’t going to change. Being labeled a specific way: If alcohol plays a major role in your friends’ lives, you might get labeled as the “sober friend” or the “boring one.” Being invited to be the designated driver: You might find that you’re only invited to events when your friends expect you to be their designated driver. “I decided to stop drinking for a while.” “I’m not interested in drinking tonight.” “I gave up alcohol.” “I’m cutting back on my drinking.” “I’m not going to drink for a while.” “I’m sober curious.” “I’m driving tonight, so I’m not drinking.” “I took a break from drinking, and I love the way I feel now. So I don’t plan to start again any time soon.” You have to get up early for an event. You're not feeling so great. You have plans to meet another friend. Invite them to go to a park, a museum, or hiking. Sign up for a class or new activity together. Join a volunteer organization. Attend events that don’t serve alcohol.

The body's hormones work together in a finely coordinated and complex system to keep us healthy and functioning. Alcohol can interfere with the operation of the hormone system and cause serious medical consequences.
 
Hormones act as chemical messengers to control and coordinate the functions of the body's tissues and organs. When the hormone system is working properly, the exact amount of hormone is released at exactly the right time and the tissues of the body accurately respond to those messages.
 
Drinking alcohol can impair the functions of the glands that release hormones and the functions of the tissues targeted by the hormones, which can result in medical problems. When alcohol impairs the hormone system's ability to work properly, it can disrupt these major bodily functions:﻿﻿
 
Research with laboratory animals has also revealed that alcohol's impact on hormonal pathways can influence alcohol-seeking behavior. Scientists believe that alcohol-seeking behavior is regulated in part by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.﻿﻿
 By interfering with the hormone system, alcohol can affect blood sugar levels, impair reproductive functions, interfere with calcium metabolism and bone structure, affect hunger and digestion, and increase the risk of osteoporosis. 
The main energy source for all body tissues is sugar glucose. The body gets glucose from food, from synthesis in the body, and from the breakdown of glycogen which is stored in the liver.
 
The body's blood sugar levels are controlled by insulin and glucagon, hormones secreted by the pancreas. They work together to maintain a constant concentration of glucose in the blood. Insulin lowers glucose levels, while glucagon raises it.
 
Other hormones from the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland back up the function of glucagon to make sure the body's glucose level doesn't fall low enough to cause fainting, passing out or even brain damage.
 
Alcohol interferes with all three sources of glucose and interferes with the hormones that regulate glucose levels. There are many ways alcohol consumption affects the body's glucose levels.﻿﻿ Alcohol is known to:
 
Chronic heavy drinking can increase the body's glucose levels. A review published in 2015 reported that chronic heavy drinking can cause glucose intolerance in healthy people.﻿﻿It can also:﻿﻿
 
There are many hormones in the body that regulate the reproductive system. The two main hormones—androgens (testosterone) and estrogens (estradiol)—are synthesized in the testes and ovaries. These hormones affect various reproductive functions. In men, they are responsible for:
 
In women, hormones perform many functions, including:
 Chronic drinking can interfere with all of these reproductive functions. Alcohol can impair the adequate functioning of the testes and ovaries and result in hormonal deficiencies, sexual dysfunction, and infertility.﻿﻿ 
Some of the problems that alcohol consumption can cause by interfering with the male hormonal system include:﻿﻿
 
Although many reproductive problems were found in women who were alcoholics, some problems were also found in women considered social drinkers. In premenopausal women, chronic heavy drinking contributes to reproductive disorders, including:﻿﻿
 
Hormones play an important role in maintaining calcium levels in the body, which is necessary not only for strong bones and teeth but also for communication between and within cells of the body. Several hormones—parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D-derived hormones, and calcitonin—work to regulate calcium absorption, excretion, and distribution between bones and body fluids.
 
Acute alcohol consumption can interfere with these hormones and therefore calcium and bone metabolism in several ways, including:﻿﻿
 
All of these problems can cause calcium deficiency which can lead to bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass and therefore an increased risk of fractures.
 Alcohol-related bone health problems pose a serious health threat for alcoholics due to the greater risks of falls and therefore fractured or broken bones. 
The good news is studies have found that alcohol's effect on bone metabolism and bone-forming cells are at least partially reversible when alcoholics stop drinking.﻿﻿
 
Researchers have found that alcohol consumption also increases the body's production of cortisol, not only while the person is drinking, but also later when the drinker is withdrawing from the effects of intoxication.﻿﻿ In the short-term, cortisol can increase blood pressure, focus alertness and attention, but in the longer term can adversely impact body functions such as bone growth, digestion, reproduction, and wound repair.

Thanks to years of research, doctors and health professionals now have a full menu of options to treat alcohol use disorders.﻿﻿ Building on this progress, scientists continue to work on new medications and discover new ways to improve the effectiveness, accessibility, quality, and cost-­effectiveness of treatment for people who have alcohol use disorders.
 
A massive study published in 2006 followed more than 1,300 study participants at 11 academic locations over a three-year period to determine what combination of treatment, medication, and counseling was the most effective for treating alcohol abuse disorders.﻿﻿
 
The Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions for Alcohol Dependence (COMBINE) study produced some surprising results when it revealed that one of the newer medications used for the treatment of alcoholism failed to improve treatment outcomes on its own.﻿﻿
 
As shown in COMBINE, no single medication or treatment strategy is effective in every case or in every person.
 
The study did find that when combined with a structured outpatient medical management intervention consisting of nine brief sessions conducted by a healthcare professional that the alcohol-deterrent medications Revia and Vivitrol (naltrexone) and up to 20 sessions of alcohol counseling were equally effective treatments for alcoholism.﻿﻿
 
""These results demonstrate that either naltrexone or specialized alcohol counseling— with structured medical management— is an effective option for treating alcohol dependence,"" said Mark L. Willenbring, M.D., director, division of treatment and recovery research, National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ""Although medical management is somewhat more intensive than the alcohol dependence interventions offered in most of today's health care settings, it is not unlike other patient care models such as initiating insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus.""
 
The study found that combining another alcohol-deterrent drug Campral (acamprosate) with the medical management program did not improve outcomes. Campral did not perform better than the placebo or dummy pill. This finding stumped researchers since previous studies performed in Europe using Campral had yielded positive treatment outcomes.
 
After 16 weeks, the COMBINE study showed overall positive outcomes for study participants.﻿﻿
 
Combined behavioral intervention (CBI)— which includes counseling integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement, and techniques to enhance mutual help group participation—has shown beneficial outcomes in studies.﻿﻿ 
 
According to research, medications seem to be a positive part of the winning combination of alcohol use disorders. And, it is underused as a method for treating alcoholism.﻿﻿
 
""The most robust finding in the study is that those receiving any medication did much better than those who received no pills at all,"" says Professor Barbara Mason, Scripps Research Institute, and an author of the study. ""This should be a wake-up call. With less than one percent of those seeking help for alcohol dependence receiving a prescription, medication is underutilized. Medication for alcoholism can offer patients an advantage for their recovery, especially in a real-world setting.""
 
In 2001, David Sinclair, Ph.D., a researcher in Finland claimed an 80 percent cure rate for alcohol dependence when anti-alcohol drugs Revia or Vivitrol are prescribed according to his Sinclair Method. Dr. Sinclair's research has been published in the peer-reviewed journals Alcohol and Alcoholism and the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology.﻿﻿ The Sinclair Method is the standard treatment protocol for alcohol dependence in Finland, the method is also used in the U.K., but the method has yet to catch on in the United States. 
 
With the Sinclair Method, people only take Revia or Vivitrol before drinking and never otherwise.﻿﻿ Revia and Vivitrol are not like other anti-alcohol drugs that cause intense sickness and hangover sensations when taken with alcohol. The change in behavior only appears over time. With the Sinclair Method, Revia or Vivitrol is taken one hour before drinking alcohol. At the end of four to six months of treatment with the Sinclair Method, 80 percent of people who had been overusing alcohol is either drinking moderately or abstaining entirely.﻿﻿
 
The way it works is when people normally drink alcohol, endorphins are released into the brain, and this reinforces the behavior of drinking alcohol. Revia and Vivitrol block the feel-good endorphins. Much like when Pavlov's dogs were presented with food when a bell was rung, these dogs became conditioned to salivate at the sound of the bell alone. However, when these dogs continued to be presented with the ringing bell and no food, the salivating stopped.
 
It is believed that the main reason the Sinclair Method has not caught on in the U.S. is two-fold. In the U.S., 12-step programs seem to dominate treatment plans prescribed by doctors, that, and doctors do not like that the Sinclair Method encourages people with alcohol dependency problems to continue drinking.﻿﻿

Overall percent days abstinent tripled, from 25 to 73 percent, and alcohol consumption per week decreased from 66 to 13 drinks, a decrease of 80 percent. Patients who received medical management plus either Revia or Vivitrol (naltrexone) or specialized counseling showed similarly improved outcomes of alcohol abstinence (80 percent) compared with patients who received medical management and placebo pills (75 percent). Patients who received Revia or Vivitrol reported less craving for alcohol. Adding either Revia or Vivitrol or specialized alcohol counseling to medical management almost doubled the chance to do well.",thank years research doctor health professionals full menu options treat alcohol use disorder build progress scientists continue work new medications discover new ways improve effectiveness accessibility quality cost effectiveness treatment people alcohol use disorder massive study publish follow study participants academic locations three year period determine combination treatment medication counsel effective treat alcohol abuse disorder combine medications behavioral interventions alcohol dependence combine study produce surprise result reveal one newer medications use treatment alcoholism fail improve treatment outcomes show combine single medication treatment strategy effective every case every person study find combine structure outpatient medical management intervention consist nine brief sessions conduct healthcare professional alcohol deterrent medications revia vivitrol naltrexone sessions alcohol counsel equally effective treatments alcoholism result demonstrate either naltrexone specialize alcohol counsel structure medical management effective option treat alcohol dependence say mark willenbring director division treatment recovery research national institute alcohol abuse alcoholism although medical management somewhat intensive alcohol dependence interventions offer today health care settings unlike patient care model initiate insulin therapy patients diabetes mellitus study find combine another alcohol deterrent drug campral acamprosate medical management program improve outcomes campral perform better placebo dummy pill find stump researchers since previous study perform europe use campral yield positive treatment outcomes weeks combine study show overall positive outcomes study participants combine behavioral intervention cbi include counsel integrate cognitive behavioral therapy motivational enhancement techniques enhance mutual help group participation show beneficial outcomes study accord research medications seem positive part win combination alcohol use disorder underused method treat alcoholism robust find study receive medication much better receive pills say professor barbara mason scripps research institute author study wake call less one percent seek help alcohol dependence receive prescription medication underutilized medication alcoholism offer patients advantage recovery especially real world set david sinclair researcher finland claim percent cure rate alcohol dependence anti alcohol drug revia vivitrol prescribe accord sinclair method sinclair research publish peer review journals alcohol alcoholism journal clinical psychopharmacology sinclair method standard treatment protocol alcohol dependence finland method also use method yet catch unite state sinclair method people take revia vivitrol drink never otherwise revia vivitrol like anti alcohol drug cause intense sickness hangover sensations take alcohol change behavior appear time sinclair method revia vivitrol take one hour drink alcohol end four six months treatment sinclair method percent people overuse alcohol either drink moderately abstain entirely way work people normally drink alcohol endorphins release brain reinforce behavior drink alcohol revia vivitrol block feel good endorphins much like pavlov dog present food bell ring dog become condition salivate sound bell alone however dog continue present ring bell food salivate stop believe main reason sinclair method catch two fold step program seem dominate treatment plan prescribe doctor doctor like sinclair method encourage people alcohol dependency problems continue drink love one struggle substance use addiction contact substance abuse mental health service administration samhsa national helpline information support treatment facilities area mental health resources see national helpline database group study substantially reduce drink treatment overall percent days abstinent triple percent alcohol consumption per week decrease drink decrease percent patients receive medical management plus either revia vivitrol naltrexone specialize counsel show similarly improve outcomes alcohol abstinence percent compare patients receive medical management placebo pills percent patients receive revia vivitrol report less crave alcohol add either revia vivitrol specialize alcohol counsel medical management almost double chance well

One effect of chronic alcoholism is the damage that long-term heavy alcohol consumption does to the brain. Certain regions in the brains of alcoholics shrink, creating lesions that result in deficits in brain function.
 
Brain imaging research has shown that the prefrontal cortex (in the front of the brain) and regions of the cerebellum (in the lower back of the brain) are particularly vulnerable to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse.
 
This means that heavy alcohol use over a long period of time will damage regions of the brain that control executive function (the prefrontal cortex) and balance and postural stability (the cerebellum).﻿﻿
 
Therefore, chronic alcoholics can progress to the point that they no longer have the ability to walk a straight line even when ""sober"" or stand on one foot, especially in the dark or when their eyes are closed.
 
Additionally, long-time alcoholics can develop deficits in the executive functioning of their brains, meaning they can demonstrate problems in putting items in order, solving problems, multitasking and problems with their working memory.﻿﻿
 Scientific studies of the brain damage caused by alcoholism have consistently shown disproportionately greater deficits in executive and balance functions compared with other components of brain function. 
When researchers began to look at why these two functions were more affected by lesions created by heavy alcohol consumption, compared to others, they found a relationship between the deficits in the cerebellum and those of the prefrontal cortex.﻿﻿
 
They found that the extent of cerebellar volume shrinkage was predictive of executive function deficits. In other words, if an alcoholic had problems with balance, he almost always had greater executive function deficits.
 
For example, a shrinkage of the cerebellum (which controls balance), but not the parietal cortex, was a predictor for the loss of spatial visualization ability, which is the ability to mentally manipulate 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures.
 
A Stanford University School of Medicine researcher theorized that the deficits caused by lesions in the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum are compounded because the circuitry in the brain that the two regions use to communicate with each other is likewise damaged by shrinkage due to alcohol abuse.﻿﻿
 
Information from the frontal cortex of the brain flows through the pons to the cerebellum, while in the meantime, information from the cerebellum flows through the thalamus to the frontal cortex.
 
Previous MRI studies of the brains of alcoholics found significant volume deficits in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, pons, and thalamus as well as the prefrontal, frontal, and parietal cortex.
 
Professor Edith Sullivan's complex and detailed examination of the front-to-cerebellar circuitry of the brains of 25 nonamnesic alcoholic men found that each major node of the circuitry showed volume deficits from alcoholism.
 
Sullivan found that disruption of these brain circuits could compound the deficits produced by shrinkage in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum either by interruption of the circuitry or by abnormalities found in the individual nodes themselves.
 
The study also found that the cerebellum, through the brain circuitry, could significantly affect the function of the prefrontal cortex, perhaps explaining why a lack of balance in alcoholics was a predictor of a loss of executive function.
 The good news is that other studies have found that the brain shrinkage caused by alcoholism will begin to reverse itself when people stop drinking.",one effect chronic alcoholism damage long term heavy alcohol consumption brain certain regions brain alcoholics shrink create lesions result deficits brain function brain image research show prefrontal cortex front brain regions cerebellum lower back brain particularly vulnerable effect long term alcohol abuse mean heavy alcohol use long period time damage regions brain control executive function prefrontal cortex balance postural stability cerebellum therefore chronic alcoholics progress point longer ability walk straight line even sober stand one foot especially dark eye close additionally long time alcoholics develop deficits executive function brain mean demonstrate problems put items order solve problems multitasking problems work memory scientific study brain damage cause alcoholism consistently show disproportionately greater deficits executive balance function compare components brain function researchers begin look two function affect lesions create heavy alcohol consumption compare others find relationship deficits cerebellum prefrontal cortex find extent cerebellar volume shrinkage predictive executive function deficits word alcoholic problems balance almost always greater executive function deficits example shrinkage cerebellum control balance parietal cortex predictor loss spatial visualization ability ability mentally manipulate dimensional dimensional figure stanford university school medicine researcher theorize deficits cause lesions prefrontal cortex cerebellum compound circuitry brain two regions use communicate likewise damage shrinkage due alcohol abuse information frontal cortex brain flow pons cerebellum meantime information cerebellum flow thalamus frontal cortex previous mri study brain alcoholics find significant volume deficits cerebellar hemispheres vermis pons thalamus well prefrontal frontal parietal cortex professor edith sullivan complex detail examination front cerebellar circuitry brain nonamnesic alcoholic men find major node circuitry show volume deficits alcoholism sullivan find disruption brain circuit could compound deficits produce shrinkage frontal cortex cerebellum either interruption circuitry abnormalities find individual nod study also find cerebellum brain circuitry could significantly affect function prefrontal cortex perhaps explain lack balance alcoholics predictor loss executive function good news study find brain shrinkage cause alcoholism begin reverse people stop drink

As we are all affected by the shifting economy, many of us are working harder than ever before and feeling overworked as a result. Yet for some, the urge to work more and more goes deeper than simply needing to pay the bills—some are addicted to work.
 
Work addiction, or workaholism, was first used to describe an uncontrollable need to work constantly. A workaholic is someone who suffers from this condition. Although a widely recognized and accepted concept in popular culture, and despite the existence of forty years of literature on the subject, work addiction is not a formally recognized medical condition or mental disorder in that it does not appear in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the DSM-V.
 
One of the reasons for this lack of recognition of work addiction is that work—even excessive work—is typically thought of as a positive trait rather than a problem. Overwork is rewarded, both financially and culturally, and may lead to the worker being seen in a more positive light in different ways. However, work addiction can be a very real problem and can interfere with functioning and relationships, in similar ways to other addictions.
 The original reason the term ""workaholic"" was coined was to demonstrate the parallel between work addiction and alcoholism, and this is probably more accurate than the common perception that someone who works excessively is a responsible and ethical person. 
Although excessive work is often well regarded and even rewarded, there are problems associated with work addiction.
 
As with other addictions, work addiction is driven by compulsion, rather than by a healthy sense of fulfillment that is common among people who simply put a lot of effort and dedication into their job, or people who are deeply committed to their work as a vocation. In fact, people who fall prey to work addiction may be quite unhappy and distressed about work, they may be overly concerned about work, they may feel out of control of their desire to work, and they may spend so much time, energy, and effort on work that it impairs non-work relationships and activities outside of work.
 
Despite the difficulties in precisely defining work addiction, several signs of workaholism have been identified. They include:
 
These signs and symptoms of work addiction share many characteristics with other addictions, particularly other behavioral addictions, in which the commitment to the activity or behavior becomes increasingly more important, and overshadows other important areas of life and relationships.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you think you may be addicted to work, try taking a break and see how you feel. If you are unable to switch off from thinking about work, and if you sense you are escaping into work to avoid other responsibilities or uncomfortable feelings, you may benefit from treatment from a mental health professional. Although you are unlikely to find a work addiction treatment program, many of the approaches used to treat other addictions can be used to help control a range of addictive behaviors.
 Increased busyness without an increase in productivity Obsessively thinking about how you can free up more time for work Spending more time working than intended Excessive use of work to maintain one's self-worth Working to reduce feelings of guilt, depression, anxiety, or hopelessness Ignoring suggestions or requests from others to cut down on work Relationship problems resulting from overwork or preoccupation with work Health problems resulting from work-related stress and/or overwork Using work as a way of coping with, escaping, or numbing feelings Developing tolerance to work, so needing to work more to get the same effects Becoming stressed if prevented from working or experiencing withdrawal if you are not working Relapsing to overwork when you try and cut down or stop",affect shift economy many work harder ever feel overwork result yet urge work deeper simply need pay bill addict work work addiction workaholism first use describe uncontrollable need work constantly workaholic someone suffer condition although widely recognize accept concept popular culture despite existence forty years literature subject work addiction formally recognize medical condition mental disorder appear current version diagnostic statistical manual mental disorder dsm dsm one reason lack recognition work addiction work even excessive work typically think positive trait rather problem overwork reward financially culturally may lead worker see positive light different ways however work addiction real problem interfere function relationships similar ways addictions original reason term workaholic coin demonstrate parallel work addiction alcoholism probably accurate common perception someone work excessively responsible ethical person although excessive work often well regard even reward problems associate work addiction addictions work addiction drive compulsion rather healthy sense fulfillment common among people simply put lot effort dedication job people deeply commit work vocation fact people fall prey work addiction may quite unhappy distress work may overly concern work may feel control desire work may spend much time energy effort work impair non work relationships activities outside work despite difficulties precisely define work addiction several sign workaholism identify include sign symptoms work addiction share many characteristics addictions particularly behavioral addictions commitment activity behavior become increasingly important overshadow important areas life relationships love one struggle substance use addiction contact substance abuse mental health service administration samhsa national helpline information support treatment facilities area mental health resources see national helpline database think may addict work try take break see feel unable switch think work sense escape work avoid responsibilities uncomfortable feel may benefit treatment mental health professional although unlikely find work addiction treatment program many approach use treat addictions use help control range addictive behaviors increase busyness without increase productivity obsessively think free time work spend time work intend excessive use work maintain one self worth work reduce feel guilt depression anxiety hopelessness ignore suggestions request others cut work relationship problems result overwork preoccupation work health problems result work relate stress overwork use work way cop escape numb feel develop tolerance work need work get effect become stress prevent work experience withdrawal work relapse overwork try cut stop

Work-life balance is something we aspire to but rarely achieve. This is particularly the case for people who work too much, including workaholics, or people who are addicted to work. Workaholism or work addiction was first used to describe an uncontrollable need to work constantly. Although there is extensive literature on the subject, work addiction is not a formally recognized medical condition or mental disorder included in the DSM.
 
Work-life balance is the ideal state of having adequate income, accomplishment, and fulfillment through work while maintaining an equal level of satisfaction through non-work social and recreational pursuits.
 
Workaholism, or the opposite, underemployment or unemployment, both interfere with work-life balance. Most commonly, people who are concerned about work-life balance are working people who want more time for relationships and family, but find that work has taken over.
 
Most of the people struggling to achieve a good work-life balance are not addicted to work, but are hard working, ambitious adults, or parents struggling to make ends meet financially. Having put most of their energy into establishing a career—which is much more difficult than it was forty years ago—it becomes hard to let go and unwind at the weekend or during the holidays. And for some, issues like Facebook addiction, smartphone addiction, and internet addiction can make it harder still to focus on relaxation, time with partners and children, and pursuits that you can't put on your resume.
 A good work-life balance means knowing how to relax and switch off from work, and actually doing this. 
Part of work-life balance is feeling good about doing this, having absolutely no sense of guilt or obligation about working or not working, and recognizing the benefits of a happy and fulfilling personal life to your success and happiness at work.
 
One of the most effective ways of achieving good work-life balance is to find your optimal level at work and settle into it. You don't always have to go for a promotion, more responsibility, or more money, if it is beyond your optimal level of performance, and you are constantly struggling to catch up. A better strategy is to find a job you really enjoy and can perform well at, and set your lifestyle goals accordingly. This could involve a career change or even a step down the career ladder.
 
Another way to balance your work and family life is to talk to, and more importantly, listen to your partner and family about what they want to do. You don't have to just do what they want, but try and find some common ground and experiences you can share. You might not find it as stimulating as work, but in time, you will find it more fulfilling.
 
Finally, don't enslave yourself to your employer. Work the hours you are paid to work and no more. Take your vacation and do something fun. Take sick time when you are ill. These are rights that have been fought for so that workers can have a decent quality of life—have respect for your predecessors and appreciate their efforts.
 
If you try these strategies and find you just can't stop yourself from working, it might be time to seek professional help.

While it may not necessarily sound like a bad thing to everyone, exercise addiction can lead to real problems, so you may be wondering, what is exercise addiction? After all, numerous studies have demonstrated the physical and emotional health benefits of regular exercise — it is essential to our well-being.﻿﻿ Unlike many other addictive behaviors, we are encouraged to exercise more. However, there is such a thing as exercise addiction—and it can have harmful consequences.
 
Several characteristics distinguish healthy regular exercise from exercise addiction.
 
Firstly, exercise addiction is maladaptive, so instead of improving a person’s life, it causes more problems. Exercise addiction can threaten health, causing injuries, physical damage due to inadequate rest, and in some instances (particularly when co-occurring with an eating disorder), malnutrition and other problems.﻿﻿
 
Secondly, it is persistent, so an exercise addict exercises too much and for too long without giving the body a chance to recover. We all overexert ourselves on occasion and usually rest afterward. But people with exercise addiction exercise for hours every day, regardless of fatigue or illness. As the individual’s principal way of coping with stress, they experience anxiety, frustration, or emotional discomfort if they are unable to do so.﻿﻿
 
Exercise addiction is probably the most contradictory of all the addictions. As well as being a widely promoted health behavior, important for the prevention and treatment for a range of ailments, exercise can be an effective part of treatment for other mental health problems.
 
Exercise is even promoted as part of a complete program of recovery from other addictions.﻿﻿ It forms part of new and effective approaches to treating mental health problems which commonly co-occur with or underlie addictions such as depression﻿﻿ and borderline personality disorder (BPD). It's understandable how some are confused by how exercise could be an addiction itself.
 
Like other behavioral addictions, exercise addiction is a controversial idea. Many experts balk at the idea that excessive exercise can constitute an addiction, believing that there has to be a psychoactive substance that produces symptoms — such as withdrawal — for an activity to be a true addiction.
 
Although there is considerable research showing that exercise releases endorphins (opioids produced within the body), and excessive exercise causes tolerance to the hormones and neurotransmitters released,﻿﻿ these physiological processes are often not considered comparable to other substance addictions.
 
Exercise addiction is not currently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the gold standard for the diagnosis of mental disorders, although several authors have suggested diagnostic criteria. Excessive exercise is included in the DSM-5 as one of the criteria for the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, along with other “compensatory behaviors” used to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, and misuse of laxatives.﻿﻿
 
There are several similarities between exercise addiction and drug addiction, including effects on mood, tolerance, and withdrawal.
 
Neurotransmitters and the brain's reward system have been implicated in exercise and other addictions. For example, dopamine has been found to play an important role in overall reward systems,﻿﻿ and regular, excessive exercise has been shown to influence parts of the brain involving dopamine.
 
Like other addictive substances and behaviors, exercise is associated with pleasure and social, cultural or sub-cultural desirability. People who develop exercise addiction tend to be inflexible in their thinking, similar to people with other addictions, and this can reinforce the pattern of addiction by helping them to exercise regularly.﻿﻿ In addition, research shows that even people at high risk of developing exercise addiction are supported in exercising by family and friends.
 
Only 8% of gym users meet the criteria for exercise addiction.﻿﻿ In the classic pattern of addiction, exercise addicts increase their amount of exercise to re-experience feelings of escapism or the natural high they had previously experienced with shorter periods of exercise. They report withdrawal symptoms when they are unable to exercise, and tend to go back to high levels of exercise after a period of abstinence or control. Three percent of gym users feel they cannot stop exercising.
 
While many reasons for exercising are shared among exercisers whether or not they are addicted — health, fitness, weight management, body image, and stress relief — exercisers who are not addicted cite other reasons that exercise addicts do not share, such as social enjoyment, relaxation, and time alone.
 
People at risk for exercise addiction have difficulties in other areas in their lives that drive them to exercise to dangerous levels. They feel strongly that exercise is the most important thing in their life, and they use exercise as a way to express emotions including anger, anxiety, and grief, and to deal with work and relationship stress. Some know that their excessive exercise has caused conflicts with their family members.﻿﻿
 
A central function of exercise addiction is the sense of control — over mood, the body, the environment — that exercise provides. It also provides a sense of structure.﻿﻿ Ironically, as with other addictions, the attempt to exert control eventually leads to a loss of control over the ability to balance the activity with other priorities in life.
 
Exercise is a great way to manage stress and to address negative feelings. If your need for exercise is greater than your ability to manage your relationships and feelings, you may need more help, both to overcome your addiction and to find healthier ways of coping. Speak with your doctor about the best way to treat your addiction.

"
Have you ever been called an ""adrenaline junkie""? The term was first popularly used in the 1991 movie ""Point Break"" in reference to people who favor high-risk activities for the rush that accompanies them. Related to this phenomenon, many people seek out high-sensation experiences for the neurophysiological effects. When dependence on these experiences is created as a way of managing stressful situations, however, it might be time to seek treatment.
 
Physiological mechanisms underlying temperament lead people to seek what feels to them like just the right amount of stimulation in a given situation. This experience of ""just the right amount"" of stimulation or sensation is deeply interconnected with psychological mechanisms of motivation and varies across people with different personality traits.
 
In fact, a 2016 study of parachute jumpers found that personality is the greatest predictor of whether a person is likely to undertake risky behavior.﻿﻿ High anxiety sensation seeking may characterize the so-called ""adrenaline junkie.""
 
Capacity for cognitive control is impaired or enhanced depending on whether a given task requires suppression of or attention to various motivational cues, according to a 2010 study.﻿﻿
 
The neurobiology behind these processes is complicated and many brain areas are implicated. Activation of the stress response is thought to drive compulsive behavior through negative reinforcement mechanisms.
 
Release of norepinephrine in the amygdala, the area of the brain activated during the stress response, may represent a key component of the transition to dependence, according to a 2009 study.﻿﻿ Meanwhile, another study focused on the avoidance-type behaviors often found in PTSD. In this 2018 animal study, researchers found that stimulation of the amygdala leads to a decrease in avoidance behaviors.﻿﻿
 
The term ""adrenaline junkie"" may have you thinking that the noradrenergic system alone is implicated in sensation-seeking behavior. A 2017 review explores how the neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, also have a huge impact on the ability to regulate impulsivity and risk-taking.﻿﻿ The review also examines how the systems which involve these neurotransmitters are dysregulated in people with substance use disorders.
 
Meanwhile, a 2016 study of so-called adrenaline junkies such as rock climbers found that regular climbers experienced frequent and intense craving states and negative affect when they stopped climbing, similar to individuals with substance use disorders.﻿﻿
 
You don’t have to be a bank robber, skydiver, or another obvious type of danger-seeker to be hooked on the rush that comes from a little stress. In fact, you could be somewhat hooked on stimulation in your everyday life and not realize it.
 An unconscious need for stimulation may influence the way you manage your schedule, the people you spend time with, and even the way you approach a deadline. 
A 2010 study suggests that neurotic individuals may create drama and crises in their lives to trigger the body’s stress response and get the rush that comes with the excitement and attenuate their negative mood.﻿﻿ Extroverted individuals may take risks to reinforce positive experiences.
 
Addiction to stimulation is not currently classified as a disorder in the DSM, however, impulsivity risk-taking behavior is relevant to a number of mental health conditions that may warrant additional treatment, such as ADHD, PTSD, and substance use disorder. Behavioral addictions are also newly becoming recognized as valid psychiatric disorders, with pathological gambling earning a spot in the DSM-5, as explored by a 2015 journal article.﻿﻿
 
While leading an exciting life in and of itself isn’t a problem, unwittingly creating crises for yourself or becoming needlessly engulfed in stressful situations can take its toll. If you tend to create more drama in your life than is necessary, the benefit of becoming aware of it is twofold:
 
Learn more about stress and stress management with these ongoing stress management resources, and take the quiz to find out if you're an adrenaline junkie.
 If your risk-taking behavior is getting out of control, causing distress, or causing you not to fulfill your responsibilities, consider seeking professional help. A mental health professional can help you explore ways to manage your behavior in healthier, more adaptive ways. You can begin to keep things exciting but take the ""crisis edge"" off, paring down unnecessarily stressful activities and distinguishing the subtle difference between a true crisis and a somewhat overblown situation. You can practice relaxation techniques to reverse your body’s stress response when you find yourself overwhelmed so you don’t experience the full negative effects of chronic stress.",ever call adrenaline junkie term first popularly use movie point break reference people favor high risk activities rush accompany relate phenomenon many people seek high sensation experience neurophysiological effect dependence experience create way manage stressful situations however might time seek treatment physiological mechanisms underlie temperament lead people seek feel like right amount stimulation give situation experience right amount stimulation sensation deeply interconnect psychological mechanisms motivation vary across people different personality traits fact study parachute jumpers find personality greatest predictor whether person likely undertake risky behavior high anxiety sensation seek may characterize call adrenaline junkie capacity cognitive control impair enhance depend whether give task require suppression attention various motivational cue accord study neurobiology behind process complicate many brain areas implicate activation stress response think drive compulsive behavior negative reinforcement mechanisms release norepinephrine amygdala area brain activate stress response may represent key component transition dependence accord study meanwhile another study focus avoidance type behaviors often find ptsd animal study researchers find stimulation amygdala lead decrease avoidance behaviors term adrenaline junkie may think noradrenergic system alone implicate sensation seek behavior review explore neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin also huge impact ability regulate impulsivity risk take review also examine systems involve neurotransmitters dysregulated people substance use disorder meanwhile study call adrenaline junkies rock climbers find regular climbers experience frequent intense crave state negative affect stop climb similar individuals substance use disorder bank robber skydiver another obvious type danger seeker hook rush come little stress fact could somewhat hook stimulation everyday life realize unconscious need stimulation may influence way manage schedule people spend time even way approach deadline study suggest neurotic individuals may create drama crises live trigger body stress response get rush come excitement attenuate negative mood extroverted individuals may take risk reinforce positive experience addiction stimulation currently classify disorder dsm however impulsivity risk take behavior relevant number mental health condition may warrant additional treatment adhd ptsd substance use disorder behavioral addictions also newly become recognize valid psychiatric disorder pathological gamble earn spot dsm explore journal article lead excite life problem unwittingly create crises become needlessly engulf stressful situations take toll tend create drama life necessary benefit become aware twofold learn stress stress management ongoing stress management resources take quiz find adrenaline junkie risk take behavior get control cause distress cause fulfill responsibilities consider seek professional help mental health professional help explore ways manage behavior healthier adaptive ways begin keep things excite take crisis edge par unnecessarily stressful activities distinguish subtle difference true crisis somewhat overblown situation practice relaxation techniques reverse body stress response find overwhelm experience full negative effect chronic stress

In a sense, we are all addicted to food. Think about what it feels like when you aren’t able to eat. You start to crave food, and become more physically and emotionally uncomfortable the longer the cravings go on for until eating becomes the most important thing for you to do. This is the constant experience of people struggling with food addiction, even if they have plenty to eat.
 
Food is essential to survival, and unlike other addictive behaviors, it is normal to eat repeatedly every day and to look forward to eating for pleasure. But several characteristics separate normal or occasional binge eating from food addiction.
 
Firstly, food addiction is maladaptive, so although people overeat to feel better, it often ends up making them feel worse and gives them more to feel bad about. Food addiction can threaten health, causing obesity, malnutrition, and other problems.
 
Secondly, the overeating that people with food addiction do is persistent, so a person addicted to food eats too much food (and often the wrong kinds of food) too much of the time. We all overeat from time to time, but people with food addiction often overeat every day, and they eat, not because they are hungry, but as their main way of coping with stress. Then if they are unable to overeat, they experience anxiety or other painful emotions.
 
As a behavioral addiction, the concept of food addiction is controversial.
 
The field is divided between those who think that overeating can be a type of addiction, and those who think that true addictions are limited to psychoactive substances that produce symptoms such as physical tolerance and withdrawal. Although this has been demonstrated in research with sugar and fat (the two most common obesity-causing constituents of food), and other studies show that food produces opiates in the body, many think that this does not necessarily constitute an addiction.
 
However, the growing epidemic of obesity over the past 20 years has raised a public health concern. Over a third of US adults and approximately 17% of children are obese. Childhood obesity has been recognized as a major health concern. This concern, along with effective treatments for addictions, which are being successfully applied to more and more problematic behaviors, is contributing to a movement towards understanding over-eating, and the consequences of obesity and related health problems, in terms of addiction.
 
Food addiction shares many features with diagnoses now included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), namely, Binge Eating Disorder, which is categorized with the Feeding and Eating Disorders. Excessive eating is also a characteristic of another eating disorder outlined in the DSM, known as Bulimia Nervosa. Some controversy remains over whether eating disorders are actually addictions, but many experts believe that they are.
 
There are several similarities between food addiction and drug addiction, including effects on mood, external cues to eat or use drugs, expectancies, restraint, ambivalence, and attribution.
 
Neurotransmitters and the brain's reward system have been implicated in food and other addictions. In animal studies, for example, dopamine has been found to play an important role in overall reward systems, and binging on sugar has been shown to influence dopamine activity.
 
Food, drugs and other addictive substances and behaviors are all associated with pleasure, hedonism, and social, cultural or sub-cultural desirability. When advertising or the people around us tell us that food, drug, or activity will feel good, it sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy. We are more likely to seek it out, and we are more likely to experience pleasure when we indulge.
 
Similarities between food addiction and other addictions suggest a universal process underlying food and other addictions. Some experts go further, theorizing that overlaps, similarities, and co-occurrences of mental health problems, including addictions, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders, and the phenomenon of a new addiction or mental health problem developing when an old addiction is treated, indicate that they are expressions of related underlying pathologies. It has been argued that viewing these conditions separately hinders the development of a comprehensive view of addictions.
 
More evidence is needed to support these proposed ideas, and at present, professionals differ in the extent to which they see these problems as related.

Shopping addiction, also known as compulsive shopping, compulsive spending, compulsive buying or oniomania, is often trivialized in the media. It is portrayed as the behavior of superficial fashion victims -- invariably female -- and typified by wealthy celebrities with little more to do with their time than purchase shoes. In this context, compulsive shopping in itself doesn't appear to be a problem.
 
The movie ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" in some ways reinforced this view, although it also contained some observations that are relevant to those suffering from problems of compulsive shopping.
 
Rarely is compulsive shopping taken as seriously as addiction to substances like alcohol and drugs or other behaviors, such as compulsive gambling. Is this because it is not a legitimate addiction?
 
Although there is a large and growing body of research into compulsive shopping, unlike research into other addictions, much of the compulsive shopping research is published in journals on marketing and consumer research. These journals have a different audience, consisting mainly of marketing professionals rather than clinical professionals. Clearly, the motives of those interested in marketing and understanding consumer behavior are quite different from those who are interested in preventing and treating addictions. So, for compulsive shopping to be recognized as a disorder in its own right, it will have to be taken on as a topic worthy of research by the addiction and medical fields and studied from that perspective.
 
One of the latest developments in compulsive shopping research is the finding that shopping online is particularly attractive to people who are ""addicted"" to shopping. This is because online shopping appeals to several motivations that are particularly strong in compulsive shoppers, including the need to seek out variety in and information about products; to buy without being seen; to avoid social interactions while shopping; and to experience pleasure while shopping.
 
As secrecy in carrying out the activity of compulsive shopping and intense pleasure while engaging in the activity are common across all addictive behaviors, this research supports the notion that compulsive shopping is, indeed, an addiction.
 Online shopping and other computer-based activities that have an addictive component, including online gambling, online porn, and video game playing, are not included in the DSM as stand-alone addictive disorders just yet. 
While these ""cyber-addictions"" are yet to gain full recognition, that is largely a reflection of the lack of a strong record of research on which to base the required detail for developing the official criteria for mental health conditions. It does not indicate that cyber-addictions are not prevalent, problematic or that they are not taken seriously by the psychiatric community.
 
There is also a growing awareness of the need to help people who suffer from financial hardship as a result of compulsive shopping.
 
Compulsive shopping has been recognized for the past 100 years, and people with problems controlling their spending are not diagnosed with shopping addiction, although they can be diagnosed under impulse control disorder, not otherwise specified. Although compulsive shopping, along with many other behavioral addictions, was under consideration for inclusion in the DSM 5, it is not currently listed as an addictive disorder, nor as a stand-alone impulse control disorder.
 
Some experts have suggested that compulsive shopping is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD, or that it is a type of bipolar disorder. Although there are overlaps, neither are currently accepted viewpoints.
 
Therefore, although shopping addiction has a long history, an it is associated with a number of mental health conditions, it is not widely recognized as a stand-alone addiction in the medical community. However, there is growing recognition of the similarities between shopping addiction and other addictions, and it may even be possible to get medical help, due to the overlap with other conditions. Certainly, compulsive shopping is something that a psychologist can help you manage.

Ever wonder why you crave sugar at the sight of your favorite candy wrapper? Do you experience sugar cravings even when you aren't hungry? If you've ever wondered why you crave sugar, the answer is simple: sugar is addictive. And sugar addiction is more common than you would think.
 
Sugar addiction is one of the most common types of food addiction—all the more insidious because, often, we don't even know it is there. Many studies have shown that sugar is one of the most palatable and addictive foods and, with this knowledge, food manufacturers often use excessive amounts of it in foods we don’t even consider to be sweet.﻿﻿
 
There are several ways in which sugar is addictive. According to research collated by David A. Kessler, former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, sugar shares several characteristics with addictive drugs. In addition to being highly palatable, sugar has a high ""hedonic value,"" meaning you experience pleasure when you eat it.﻿﻿
 Eating sugar is reinforcing, meaning the more you do it, the more you want to do it. 
From a scientific point of view, palatable food not only tastes good but when we eat it, it makes us want to eat more of it. Sugar has been shown to have this effect experimentally, even with newborn babies and with animals.﻿﻿ And it is obvious why—we need calories for survival, so we respond most readily to high-calorie foods.
 
The hedonic value of sugary foods is the intensity of pleasure experienced by the person eating it. The point at which sweet beverages are most pleasurable has been identified at 10 percent. This is known as the “bliss point.”﻿﻿ Food retailers keep their foods as close to the bliss point as possible to stimulate people's desire to re-experience the bliss point by eating that food again and again.
 
There are two ways that sugar is reinforcing:﻿﻿
 
Candy, and especially chocolate, is heavily marketed, particularly to children and women. This is a problem because children’s early experiences often shape their later behavior. So, if they are eating a lot of sugar when they are young, they are more likely to want sugar when they are older.
 
Over-consumption of sugar has been linked to many different health problems. And many children and adults become chocoholics, which also carries a risk of caffeine addiction as chocolate is a caffeine-containing food.
 
Health risks aren’t the only concern related to the over-consumption of sugar. One research study has even demonstrated a correlation between childhood daily candy consumption and later violence in adulthood.﻿﻿
 
Moreover, the overuse of sugar has played a major role in the epidemic of obesity in North America—not only through the direct overconsumption of sweet foods like candy but also through the addition of sugar to make many savory foods more palatable.﻿﻿ This makes people more likely to overeat such foods and increases the number of calories they consume.
 After being exposed to the taste of sugar, people—and other animals—are willing to work harder to get more of it, regardless of whether or not they are hungry. Once something else has been associated with the taste of sugar, people will respond to that as well. Because sugar works as a reward, people respond positively with everything they associate with sugar—whether it is a particular food containing sugar, a particular restaurant, or a particular brand image. This is the reason that the second you recognize your favorite candy wrapper, you crave sugar.",ever wonder crave sugar sight favorite candy wrapper experience sugar crave even hungry ever wonder crave sugar answer simple sugar addictive sugar addiction common would think sugar addiction one common type food addiction insidious often even know many study show sugar one palatable addictive foods knowledge food manufacturers often use excessive amount foods even consider sweet several ways sugar addictive accord research collate david kessler former commissioner food drug administration sugar share several characteristics addictive drug addition highly palatable sugar high hedonic value mean experience pleasure eat eat sugar reinforce mean want scientific point view palatable food taste good eat make want eat sugar show effect experimentally even newborn baby animals obvious need calories survival respond readily high calorie foods hedonic value sugary foods intensity pleasure experience person eat point sweet beverages pleasurable identify percent know bliss point food retailers keep foods close bliss point possible stimulate people desire experience bliss point eat food two ways sugar reinforce candy especially chocolate heavily market particularly children women problem children early experience often shape later behavior eat lot sugar young likely want sugar older consumption sugar link many different health problems many children adults become chocoholics also carry risk caffeine addiction chocolate caffeine contain food health risk concern relate consumption sugar one research study even demonstrate correlation childhood daily candy consumption later violence adulthood moreover overuse sugar play major role epidemic obesity north america direct overconsumption sweet foods like candy also addition sugar make many savory foods palatable make people likely overeat foods increase number calories consume expose taste sugar people animals will work harder get regardless whether hungry something else associate taste sugar people respond well sugar work reward people respond positively everything associate sugar whether particular food contain sugar particular restaurant particular brand image reason second recognize favorite candy wrapper crave sugar

The Excessive Appetites model of addiction was developed by Professor Jim Orford in 1985, to challenge to prevailing ""disease"" model of addiction. This model embraces the concept of behavioral addictions, focusing on the psychological, rather than the physiological aspects of how people become addicted to substances, such as alcohol and heroin, and equally, to activities, such as gambling and eating. This article outlines some of the key features of the model.
 
According to the model, addiction develops through a process. The first stage of this process is taking up the ""appetitive"" behavior. This typically starts in the teenage years, when most people start being exposed to the activities which can become addictive, or in the case of eating or exercise, start to gain more choice and autonomy over what they spend their time doing, and how much time they spend doing it.
 
Whether or not a young person takes up the behavior depends on both their personality and their surrounding environment, including the people and culture around them. As Orford describes it, ""The uptake of new behavior does not occur in a psychological vacuum, but as part of a constellation of changing beliefs, preferences, and habits.""
 
As teens become adults, many of them ""mature out"" of addictive behaviors, but some do not.
 
Once people have taken up or tried addictive behaviors, they discover that these behaviors are powerful ""mood modifiers."" This means that when a person engages in addictive behavior, they experience pleasure or euphoria. Through addictive behaviors, people can make themselves feel better, at least during the early stages of the addiction process.
 
This can be in the form of reducing tension, reducing self-awareness, fulfilling positive expectations they have about how the behavior will make them feel, increasing positive emotions, and decreasing, or escaping from, negative emotions. The mood enhancement aspects of the behavior can also help to bolster their self-esteem or social image, and it can help people to cope with past trauma, such as physical or sexual abuse.
 
This process of managing mood and feelings takes place in social and cultural situations that also influence whether the individual person develops an addiction. The availability and affordability of substances and their use by friends and family strongly predict whether people will go on to develop addictions, although people who do become addicted still tend to see their addiction as being primarily a personal choice.
 
There are many studies showing that most people conform to social norms and are restrained in their addictive behaviors, and do not develop the pattern of excessive behavior, which a minority of people do so excessively.
 
Once people have taken up the behavior and discover they can use it to make themselves feel better, associations develop between the behavior and the states of mind and feeling that the person desires. These associations develop along neurological, brain pathways, and become automatic. Cues that remind the person of the behavior can trigger the desire and then the seeking out of the behavior.
 
Over time, the individual learns to associate feeling better with the addictive behavior. This might not even be accurate, but people who become addicted attribute positive feelings with the behavior more and more. The addicted person constructs a whole explanation in their mind about how the behavior makes them feel better. They come to believe that the behavior is the key to feeling good, regardless of how it actually makes them feel, and the negative consequences that follow.
 
Over time, people who become addicted become more and more attached to the addictive behavior, and more and more committed to engaging in the behavior. This higher level of attachment can lead to new ways of engaging in the behavior to increase the effects, such as injecting drugs, or binge eating, leading to the letting go of the usual restraints around the behavior that keep most people in check.

According to psychologist and addictions expert, Jim Orford, addictions can best be understood as appetites that have become excessive through a psychological process. This is a very different perspective from the traditional view of addictions as being primarily driven by an addictive substance that is consumed, such as alcohol, cocaine, or heroin.
 
Jim Orford's approach to understanding addiction was first developed in 1985, with the publication of his ground-breaking book, Excessive Appetites: A Psychological View of Addictions. The second edition of the book was published in 2000.
 
The central idea of the theory is that addictions are types of extreme appetites, rather than forms of dependency on drugs. The five core appetites he identified in the theory are drinking alcohol, gambling, drug taking, eating, and exercise. These examples are chosen as the clearest and best-documented examples of the phenomenon of addiction, all being common and not problematic to many people, but excessive and troubling when strong attachments to them are developed in a minority of people.
 
While the excessive appetites perspective recognizes alcohol and drugs as addictions, they are seen as examples of addictions, rather than capturing the whole experience of addiction per se. In fact, according to this view, the dramatic problems associated with drug addictions have actually clouded our understanding of what is really going on with addictions.
 Rather than being a purely physiological process, the excessive appetites theory of addiction explains addiction as a complex psychological process, involving a large number of contributing factors. 
Rather than being a purely physiological process, the excessive appetites theory of addiction explains addiction as a complex psychological process, involving a large number of contributing factors.
 
The idea that addictions are excessive appetites is different from previous theories in two key ways. Firstly, addiction is described as a largely psychological process, rather than a physical disease. Secondly, addiction can occur in response to a wide range of different behaviors, not just to alcohol and other drugs, which predominate work on addiction.
 
The excessive appetites theory of addiction is one of the strongest and clearest arguments for the existence of behavioral addictions, such as gambling addiction, food addiction and exercise addiction, which are specifically included and explored in the theory. Other behavioral addictions acknowledged include sex addiction, internet addiction, television addiction, video game addiction, and various other compulsive behaviors. He also mentions problematic behaviors such as shoplifting and joyriding as potential addictions.
 
However, perhaps surprisingly, the originator of the theory, Jim Orford, argued against his concept of addiction being extended so far as to dilute the concept, and thereby diminish its importance. While critics of the theory have reduced the idea to absurd levels, as if to invalidate the idea, the suggestion that you can be addicted to everyday activities which have no negative consequences, such as tennis playing or crosswords, is actually missing the point entirely -- the whole point of the theory is that there are negative consequences that cause harm to the individual or to those around them. The person who has an addiction may or may not like the activity, and it is not the liking or disliking that makes it a problem. It is the indulgence of the activity to the degree that it hurts people, and yet the behavior persists, even when the person wants to stop, that is the problem.

Sex addiction can be conceptualized as the compulsive engagement in sex despite negative consequences. Moreover, it is a behavior that is emotionally distressing rather than fulfilling. While not always recognized as a legitimate diagnosis, sex addiction has real consequences, including a negative impact on relationships and well-being.
 
The concept of sex addiction has been thought of in a variety of ways. A sexual addiction does share many of the hallmarks of clinical addiction. One of these hallmarks is that the person will be unable to control their behavior even if the negative consequences are clear (or even likely).
 As opposed to someone with a healthy sex drive, a person with a sex addiction will spend a disproportionate amount of time seeking or engaging in sex while keeping the activity secret from others.﻿﻿ 
People with a sex addiction will be unable to stop the behavior unless there is some sort of intervening event. As a result, personal and professional relationships may suffer. There may even be an increased risk of sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, if a person is unable to rein in their sexual impulses.
 
People with a sex addiction often will use sex as a form of escape from other emotional and psychological problems, including stress, anxiety, depression, and social isolation.﻿﻿
 
Not everyone in the medical community is convinced that sex addiction is an established diagnosis.﻿﻿ Because of this, it is not listed as a clinical diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).
 
As a result, the diagnostic criteria for a sex addiction is often vague and subjective. However, several defining features common to people with sex addiction have been suggested.:
 
In fact, a sexual addiction is most often characterized by a vicious circle of hypersexuality and low self-esteem.﻿﻿ Although sex can bring short-term relief, the harm to the person's psychological well-being will often increase and worsen over time.
 
A person does not have to engage in extreme or ""strange"" sex to have an addiction. They will simply be unable to stop themselves despite the harm that they know may result from their behavior.
 
There are a number of theories as to why a sexual addiction occurs. Some of these involve conceptualizing a sex addiction as a form of impulse control, obsessive-compulsive or relationship disorder. They also include the idea that in some individuals sexual addictions emerge as a consequence and way of coping with early traumas, including sexual trauma.
 
In some forms of mental illness (such as bipolar disorder), hypersexuality may be a symptom. In certain instances, neurological disorders (such as epilepsy, head injury, or dementia), have been known to cause hypersexual behaviors. Certain drugs that impact dopamine may also rarely do the same.
 
Sexual addiction requires treatment from a medical professional experienced in the field, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or sex therapist.﻿﻿ Treatment can vary based on the underlying cause, but will typically be conducted on an outpatient basis with counseling and behavioral therapies.
 
If the sex addiction is associated with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder, medications may be prescribed as part of the treatment plan. There are currently no established recommendations on the appropriate use of medications to treat a sex addiction outside of the realm of these clinically classified disorders.
 
The first point of contact can be a family doctor or local psychiatric association, both of which can make a referral to the appropriate specialist. Marital therapy may also be helpful.﻿﻿
 
There are also a growing number of sex addiction support groups, some of which deal with co-additions (such as sex and substance abuse) and others of which are built on a 12-step recovery model.

Sexual activities may be inappropriate and/or risky and may include exhibitionism, public sex, sex with prostitutes, or regular attendance at sex clubs. The constant urge for sex is typically interspersed with feelings of regret, anxiety, depression, or shame. The person engages in other forms of sex when alone, including phone sex, pornography, or computer sex.  The person engages in sex with multiple partners and/or has extramarital affairs.

"
Oniomania (compulsive shopping, or what's more commonly referred to as shopping addiction) is perhaps the most socially acceptable addiction. Think about it: We are surrounded by advertising that tells us that buying will make us happy.
 
We are encouraged by politicians to spend as a way of boosting the economy. And, for some of us, there is an allure of wanting what everyone else seems to have. Consumerism, by our own intentions or not (or some combination), has become a measure of social worth.
 
Shopping addiction is a behavioral addiction that involves compulsive buying as a way to feel good and avoid negative feelings, such as anxiety and depression. Like other behavioral addictions, shopping addiction can take over as a preoccupation that leads to problems in other areas of your life.﻿﻿
 Almost everyone shops to some degree, but only about 6% of the U.S. population is thought to have a shopping addiction. 
Usually beginning in one's late teens and early adulthood, shopping addiction often co-occurs with other disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, other impulse control disorders, and personality disorders.﻿﻿ Some people develop shopping addiction as a way to try and boost their self-esteem, although it doesn't tend to be very effective for this.
 
So what is the difference between normal shopping, occasional splurges, and shopping addiction? As with all addictions, what sets shopping addiction apart from other types of shopping is that the behavior becomes the person’s main way of coping with stress,﻿﻿ to the point where they continue to shop excessively even when it is clearly having a negative impact on other areas of their life.
 
As with other addictions, money problems can develop and relationships can become damaged, yet people with shopping addiction (sometimes called ""shopaholics"") feel unable to stop or even control their spending.
 
This difficulty in controlling the desire to shop emerges from a personality pattern that shopaholics share, and that differentiates them from most other people. Often low in self-esteem,﻿﻿ they are easily influenced, and are often kindhearted, sympathetic, and polite to others, although they are often lonely and isolated. Shopping gives them a way to seek out contact with others.
 
People with shopping addiction tend to be more materialistic than other shoppers and try to prop themselves up by seeking status through material objects and seeking approval from others. They engage in fantasy more than other people, and—as with other people with addictions—have a hard time resisting their impulses.
 
As a result, they are more susceptible to marketing and advertising messages that surround us on a daily basis.
 
While advertising, in general, is designed to exaggerate the positive results of purchase and suggest that the purchase will lead to an escape from life's problems, certain marketing tricks are designed to trigger impulse buying and specifically target the impulsive nature of people with a shopping addiction.
 
People who gain pleasure and escape negative feelings through shopping sometimes call it ""retail therapy."" This phrase implies that you can get the same benefit from buying yourself something as you would from engaging in counseling or therapy. This is an incorrect and unhelpful idea. 
 
While the term retail therapy is often used in a tongue-in-cheek manner, some people, including shopaholics, actively make time to shop simply as a way to cope with negative feelings.﻿﻿ 
 
Although there are circumstances when a new purchase can actually solve a problem, this is not typically thought of as retail therapy. Usually, the things that people buy when they are engaging in retail therapy are unnecessary, and the corresponding financial cost may actually reduce resources for solving other life problems.
 Online shopping addiction is a form of internet addiction, and people with social anxiety are particularly vulnerable to developing this type, as it does not require any face-to-face contact. Like other cyber addictions, it feels anonymous. 
Impulse buying is an unplanned purchase that happens on the spur of the moment in reaction to the immediate desire to have something you see in a shop. Impulse buying is a little different from compulsive buying, which is typically more pre-planned as a way of escaping negative feelings. But again, people with shopping addiction may engage in both types of addictive buying.
 
Like other behavioral addictions, shopping addiction is a controversial idea. Many experts balk at the idea that excessive spending is an addiction, believing that there has to be a psychoactive substance that produces symptoms, such as physical tolerance and withdrawal, for an activity to be a true addiction.﻿﻿
 
There is also some disagreement among professionals about whether compulsive shopping should be considered an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), impulse control disorder (like kleptomania, or compulsive stealing), mood disorder (like depression), or behavioral addiction (like gambling disorder).﻿﻿
 
There are several characteristics that shopping addiction shares with other addictions. As with other addictions, people who over-shop become preoccupied with spending and devote significant time and money to the activity.
 
Actual spending is important to the process of shopping addiction; window shopping does not constitute an addiction, and the addictive pattern is actually driven by the process of spending money.﻿﻿
 
As with other addictions, shopping addiction is highly ritualized and follows a typically addictive pattern of thoughts about shopping, planning shopping trips, and the shopping act itself, often described as pleasurable, ecstatic even, and as providing relief from negative feelings. Finally, the shopper crashes, with feelings of disappointment, particularly with him/herself.
 Compulsive shoppers use shopping as a way of escaping negative feelings, such as depression, anxiety, boredom, and anger, as well as self-critical thoughts. Unfortunately, the escape is short-lived. 
Items purchased during a compulsive shopping spree are often simply hoarded unused,﻿﻿ and compulsive shoppers then begin to plan the next spending spree. Most shop alone, although some shop with others who enjoy it. Generally, it will lead to embarrassment to shop with people who don’t share this type of enthusiasm for shopping.
 
Research indicates that around three-quarters of compulsive shoppers are willing to admit their shopping is problematic, particularly in areas of finances and relationships.﻿﻿ Of course, this may reflect the willingness of those who participate in research to admit to having these (or any) problems.
 Shopping addiction is hard to live with because we all need to shop sometimes. Steps you can take that might help include: 
Overcoming any addiction requires learning alternative ways of handling the stress and distress of everyday existence. This can be done on your own, but often people benefit from counseling or therapy. In the meantime, there is a lot you can do to reduce the harm of compulsive spending and get the problematic behavior under control. Developing your own spending plan can be a good first step.      
 
Fortunately, although not yet well-researched, compulsive shopping does appear to respond well to a range of treatments, including medications, self-help books, self-help groups, financial counseling, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).﻿﻿
 
Some of the personality characteristics found in the ""shopaholic"" personality bode well for the ability to be able to develop and respond well to a therapeutic relationship, which is the best predictor of success in addiction treatment. It should be noted, however, that although some medications show promise, results are mixed, so they should not be considered a sole or reliable treatment.﻿﻿
 If you believe you may have a shopping addiction, discuss possible treatments with your doctor. If your doctor doesn't take your shopping problem seriously, you might find a psychologist more helpful (and you might reconsider your relationship with your physician all together). 
Getting help in understanding the emotional roots of your shopping addiction, as well as finding ways of overcoming your tendency to use shopping to cope, are important aspects of recovery from this confusing condition.
 
Your relationships may have suffered as a result of your over-shopping. Psychological support can also help you make amends and restore trust with those who may have been hurt by your behavior. You may also find that therapy helps you to deepen your relationships by leading you to better understand how to connect with other people in ways that don't revolve around money.
 
Depending on how serious your shopping addiction is, you may also find it helpful to get financial counseling, particularly if you have run up debts by spending more than you earn.
 
You could make an appointment with a financial advisor or consultant at your bank to discuss options for restricting your access to easy spending, to explore strategies for paying off bank debts and bank charges, and to put money into less accessible savings accounts as a way of interrupting the easy access to cash that tends to fuel the addiction.

Shopping addiction can be as distressing as any other addiction. But there is hope, and support from those around you can help you to control your spending. Remember, you are a worthwhile person, no matter how much or how little you own.
 Although widespread consumerism has escalated in recent years, shopping addiction is not a new disorder. It was recognized as far back as the early nineteenth century and was cited as a psychiatric disorder in the early twentieth century.﻿﻿ As with other addictions, shopping addiction is usually a way of coping with the emotional pain and difficulty of life, and it tends to make things worse rather than better for the shopper. Despite its long history, shopping addiction is controversial, and experts, as well as the public, disagree about whether shopping addiction is a real addiction.﻿﻿ People who struggle with shopping addiction typically spend more time and money on shopping than they can afford, and many get into financial problems as a result of their overspending. Shopping addiction can involve both impulsive and compulsive spending, which produce a temporary high. That said, people who are addicted to shopping are often left feeling empty and unsatisfied with their purchases when they get home.﻿﻿ Finding alternative ways of enjoying your leisure time is essential to breaking the cycle of using shopping as a way of trying to feel better about yourself. If someone else in your family can take responsibility for shopping for essentials, such as food and household items, it can help to delegate the responsibility to them, at least temporarily while you seek help. It is a good idea to get rid of credit cards and keep only a small amount of emergency cash on you, so you can't impulse buy.   Shopping only with friends or relatives who do not compulsively spend is also a good idea, as they can help you to curb your spending.",oniomania compulsive shop commonly refer shop addiction perhaps socially acceptable addiction think surround advertise tell buy make

Spending money is part of modern life. Since spending cannot be quit cold turkey, it can be especially difficult for people who have a shopping addiction to get harmful shopping behaviors under control while they continue to purchase necessities. To make matters worse, though the DSM-5 was the first to recognize select behavioral addictions like gambling disorder, compulsive shopping is not currently recognized as a distinct disorder. It does, however, appear in the context as a symptom of other mental health problems, such as bipolar disorder.
 
If you feel that your shopping is out of control, consider seeing your doctor to rule out a treatable medical condition. If you have a true shopping addiction, you will not only be intensely preoccupied with buying and shopping, but you will feel euphoria or relief after making a purchase, followed later on by guilt and shame. You may also grow very anxious before making a purchase.
 
It doesn't matter whether you are scraping by on a skimpy paycheck or living a life of luxury. Before you spend on any nonessential purchases, pay your monthly bills like rent, electricity, and groceries. If there are any non-essentials you take for granted, such as phone, internet, and travel expenses, pay for them upfront, too.
 
Food can be among the trickiest essential purchases to get right. Try stocking up on non-perishable foods at the beginning of the month, and then set aside an amount you can afford each week to cover fresh fruit, vegetables, and dairy products.
 
The most common fuel for overspending is the credit card. It's quick and easy to use, so you can easily make an impulse buy with no immediate consequences. With the ""buy now, pay later"" concept, you can drain your bank account for next month as well as this month. To avoid the credit trap, try taking only the cash you can comfortably afford to spend with you on each shopping trip. Use cash as a physical reminder of your budget, and stick to it.
 
Clearing your credit card debt and ditching your credit cards will also help improve your credit rating, which can have an impact on far more than your future access to credit.
 
Start by making a spending plan, then try to stick to it. If you have a tendency to spend any money left over after covering what is included in your spending plan, start to make note of what you overspend on. If it is non-essential (such as extra clothing, shoes or other accessories, or electronics), give yourself a limit. Determine how much you can reasonably afford, in terms of money, storage, and emotional cost. Keep all of your receipts.
 
If you find you have overspent on an unnecessary purchase, return what you can. And for anything you just cannot bear to take back, give up its predecessor. For example, if you just have to have those designer shoes you found for $100, donate the scuffed pair to charity. You won't be overwhelmed by so many items in your closet, and you will be more likely to actually use what you buy.
 
Shopaholics are prone to be tempted by discounts, which appear to offer a way you can have your cake and eat it, too. You may even feel like you are saving money by spending on something with a discount. In reality, you're still going to be out of pocket.
 Each time you are tempted by an apparent bargain, ask yourself, ""Do I need it?"" and ""Is it worth full price?"" Only consider the purchase if the answer is yes to both questions. 
If you have a shopping addiction, you're not alone. A 2006 Stanford University study concluded that while no study has employed a large enough sample to estimate the prevalence of compulsive shopping across the general population, of the 2,513 adults surveyed in their study, 6% of women and 5.5% of men showed symptoms consistent with compulsive buying disorder.
 
If you've tried following these steps and are still struggling, you may want to consider joining a group that offers help. Debtors Anonymous offers support groups and various resources for those who struggle to cope with unmanageable debt but can't seem to stop spending.

While Facebook addiction is not a recognized condition, there has been increasing concern from Facebook users and those who care about them that Facebook can be addictive and that Facebook use carries several potentially harmful effects.
 
It's important to know that addiction has a number of characteristics, including the amount of time spent on the behavior, the exclusion of other behaviors, and the negative impact on important areas of life. Remember, many people log on to Facebook every day with no harmful consequences. But if you or someone you care about seems to be becoming addicted to Facebook, or is developing problems related to Facebook use, here are some suggestions for dealing with them.
 
Please note, these suggestions do not constitute medical advice, and you should consult your doctor if you think you may have a genuine physical or psychological problem.
 
The first step is to establish how much time is spent on Facebook. Even if you are looking at Facebook every day, you may not be using Facebook excessively.
 Your total screen time—excluding work and school-related computer use—should not exceed two hours per day. This includes television and texting. 
If you are spending more than two hours per day on screen time, and you think Facebook is the culprit, decide how much time you can realistically spend on Facebook while allowing for the rest of your screen time to stay within 2 hours. Then choose the time of day you will log onto Facebook.
 
For example, you could allow yourself half an hour in the evening each day, or you could divide it into 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening. Then use a timer and stop when the alarm tells you time is up.
 
Think about whether Facebook time has become the most important thing in your life, compared to other activities, including work, school, recreation, real-time with friends and family, and other interests. If Facebook is top of the list, there might be a problem developing. And if other activities are being given up to provide more time for Facebook use, there is definitely a problem with prioritizing.
 
Pay special attention to the following:
 
These can turn into serious harms that can cause real problems in a person’s life.
 Make a list of all the things you would like to be doing, instead of spending time on Facebook. Then start to plan your time with at least one activity you would like to be doing instead of spending time on Facebook each day. 
For example, if you would like to read a book, but haven’t had time, take the book with you when you go out, and take it out and read it during your break instead of logging onto Facebook. The activities you use to replace Facebook time can be quite small, but make sure you follow through and do at least one every day. And three meals a day, a shower every day, and regular bathroom visits should take place every day.
 
Facebook can start out nice, but quickly turn nasty. Sometimes, people can become very upset and preoccupied with things that are posted up on Facebook. Have any of the following happened to you?
 Never accept a friend request from someone you do not know. Unfriend anyone who has cyber-stalked, cyber-bullied, or sexted you on Facebook immediately, and add them to your blocked list. 
If you have a large number of Facebook friends, combining work relationships and acquaintances, open a LinkedIn account and move all your professional contacts to that account. You can email them to explain you are using LinkedIn for your professional network, and Facebook for close friends and family. Then delete anyone you don’t trust or know well.
 
If one of your friends repeatedly posts comments you find disturbing or offensive, you can hide their comments without unfriending them. Check out the privacy settings to prevent others from being able to see tagged photos of you.
 
Some people are bothered by the way Facebook can bring out their bad side. Whether it is posting comments that hurt others’ feelings, posting up pictures that show you in a bad light, or generally getting a little too nosy with other people’s business, sometimes your fingers can type a little faster than your brain can think through the possible short- and long-term effects.
 If you feel Facebook is bringing out your bad side, it might be time for a hiatus. Quit Facebook for a month, then try again, with some boundaries for yourself about what you will and won’t do online. Are you neglecting your hygiene, need for exercise, or healthy eating? Are you isolating yourself by spending time on Facebook rather than having real-life relationships? Are you failing at school or work, because of spending too much time on Facebook? Have you lost sleep over something someone has posted up on Facebook? Have you been cyber-stalked or cyber-bullied on Facebook? Have you received a sext through Facebook?

Internet addiction is a behavioral addiction in which a person becomes dependent on use of the Internet, or other online devices, as a maladaptive way of coping with life's stresses. Internet addiction is becoming widely recognized and acknowledged, particularly in countries where it is affecting large numbers of people, such as South Korea, where it has been declared a national health problem.﻿﻿ Much of the current research on the subject of Internet addiction has been carried out in Asia. It is also a growing concern in developed nations in North America and Europe.
 
As Internet addiction is not formally recognized as an addictive disorder, it may be difficult to get a diagnosis. However, several leading experts in the field of behavioral addiction have contributed to the current knowledge of symptoms of Internet addiction. All types of Internet addiction contain the following four components:﻿﻿
 
Despite the agreement that excessive Internet use is a key symptom, no one seems able to define exactly how much computer time counts as excessive. While guidelines suggest no more than two hours of screen time per day for youths under 18, there are no official recommendations for adults.﻿﻿ Furthermore, two hours can be unrealistic for people who use computers for work or study. Some authors add the caveat “for non-essential use,” but for someone with an Internet addiction, all computer use can feel essential.
 
Here are some questions from Internet addiction assessment instruments that will help you to evaluate how much is too much.﻿﻿
 
If any of these situations are coming up on a daily basis, you may be addicted to the Internet.
 
Although originally understood to be the basis of physical dependence on alcohol or drugs, withdrawal symptoms are now being recognized in behavioral addictions, including Internet addiction.
 
Common Internet withdrawal symptoms include anger, tension, and depression when Internet access is not available.﻿﻿ These symptoms may be perceived as boredom, joylessness, moodiness, nervousness, and irritability when you can’t go on the computer.
 
Tolerance is another hallmark of alcohol and drug addiction and seems to be applicable to Internet addiction as well.﻿﻿ This can be understood as wanting—and from the user's point of view, needing—more and more computer-related stimulation. You might want ever-increasing amounts of time on the computer, so it gradually takes over everything you do. The quest for more is likely a predominant theme in your thought processes and planning.
 
If Internet addiction caused no harm, there would be no problem. But when excessive computer use becomes addictive, something starts to suffer.﻿﻿
 One negative effect of internet addiction is that you may not have any offline personal relationships, or the ones you do have may be neglected or suffer arguments over your Internet use. 
Online affairs can develop quickly and easily, sometimes without the person even believing online infidelity is cheating on their partner.
 
You may see your grades and other achievements suffer from so much of your attention being devoted to Internet use. You may also have little energy for anything other than computer use—people with Internet addiction are often exhausted from staying up too late on the computer and becoming sleep deprived.
 
Finances can also suffer, particularly if your addiction is for online gambling, online shopping, or cybersex.
 
Internet addiction is particularly concerning for kids and teens. Children lack the knowledge and awareness to properly manage their own computer use and have no idea about the potential harms that the Internet can open them up to. The majority of kids have access to a computer, and it has become commonplace for kids and teens to carry cellphones.
 
While this may reassure parents that they can have two-way contact with their child in an emergency, there are very real risks that this constant access to the Internet can expose them to.
 
In addition, kids who play games online often face peer pressure to play for extended periods of time in order to support the group they are playing with or to keep their skills sharp. This lack of boundaries can make kids vulnerable to developing video game addiction.﻿﻿ This can also be disruptive to the development of healthy social relationships and can lead to isolation and victimization.
 Children and teens are advised to have no more than two hours of screen time per day.﻿﻿ 
If you recognize the symptoms of Internet addiction in yourself or someone in your care, talk to your doctor about getting help. As well as being able to provide referrals to Internet addiction clinics, psychologists, and other therapists, your doctor can prescribe medications or therapy to treat an underlying problem if you have one, such as depression or social anxiety disorder.﻿﻿
 
Internet addiction can also overlap with other behavioral addictions, such as work addiction, television addiction, and smartphone addiction.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with an addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Internet addiction can have devastating effects on individuals, families, and particularly growing children and teens. Getting help may be challenging but can make a huge difference in your quality of life.
 Internet addiction is not yet an officially recognized mental disorder. Researchers have formulated diagnostic criteria for Internet addiction, but it is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). However, Internet gaming disorder is included as a condition for further study,﻿﻿ and Internet addiction is developing as a specialist area. At least three subtypes of Internet addiction have been identified: video game addiction, cybersex or online sex addiction, and online gambling addiction.﻿﻿ Increasingly, addiction to mobile devices, such as cellphones and smartphones, and addiction to social networking sites, such as Facebook, are being investigated. There may be overlaps between each of these subtypes. For example, online gambling involves online games, and online games may have elements of pornography. Sexting, or sending sexually explicit texts, has landed many people in trouble. Some have been teens who have found themselves in hot water with child pornography charges if they are underage.﻿﻿ Treatment for Internet addiction is available, but only a few specialized Internet addiction services exist. However, a psychologist with knowledge of addiction treatment will probably be able to help. stay online longer than you intended? hear other people in your life complain about how much time you spend online? say or think, “Just a few more minutes” when online? try and fail to cut down on how much time you spend online? hide how long you’ve been online? Children have become increasingly accustomed to lengthy periods of time connected to the Internet, disconnecting them from the surrounding world. Children who own a computer and have privileged online access have an increased risk of involvement in cyberbullying, both as a victim and as a perpetrator.﻿﻿ Children who engage in problematic internet use are more likely to use their cellphone for cybersex, particularly through sexting,﻿﻿ or access apps which could potentially increase the risk of sex addiction and online sexual harms, such as Tinder.",internet addiction behavioral addiction person become dependent use internet online devices maladaptive way cop life stress internet addiction become widely recognize acknowledge

Ask parents who watch their child retreat into the world of video games for hours every day, neglect their friends and family, and lose interest in anything but their game console, and they will say that yes, video game addiction is as real as an addiction to alcohol or cocaine. But do they really know what they are evaluating? Surely the alcoholic who drinks himself to death, or the drug addict who overdoses, is sicker than a kid who spends too long in front of a computer screen?
 
Video game addiction was not included in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V); the only non-substance addictive disorder in the DSM is gambling disorder. The video game addiction concept has been controversial, with the American Medical Association first supporting, then withdrawing support from a proposal for it to be included. Video game addiction has also been proposed as a subtype of Internet addiction, along with sexual preoccupations and online gambling.
 
Asian countries, such as South Korea, are recognizing video game addiction as an urgent public health matter, with several deaths having occurred in internet cafes, apparently as a result of blood clots occurring during a prolonged sitting at computers. In the United States, estimates of video game addiction and related problems are more difficult, with computers accessed at home rather than in shared public places. However, case studies show similar patterns of behavior across cultures, and it is argued that they are the same phenomenon.
 
When free from the constraints of school, many kids simply want to be entertained as easily as possible. And many parents want this for their kids too, as the shift to single-parent families and two-income families leaves many parents with little time to focus on interaction with their kids. Giving their child the latest video game serves two purposes: It alleviates parental guilt about not spending enough time with the child, and it keeps the child happily occupied. This kind of lifestyle can quickly settle into a pattern which makes lengthy periods in front of computer games rewarding for everyone concerned.
 
Yet there is currently no clear or consistent message to parents about whether computer game addiction is a real risk. Video games may also have positive effects, and game developers are making efforts to incorporate health benefits, such as exercise, into games. So how are parents supposed to know how to respond?
 
Although there is no recognition of video game addiction in the DSM-V, that is no indication that it does not exist now.
 
The idea of video game addiction has rapidly grown out of an industry geared specifically at getting kids to buy as many games as possible. Halfway between toys and TV, video games are targeted at naïve youngsters who are unable to set their own limits on play time or to make well-thought-out decisions about how to spend their time — with some game manufacturers even boasting in their advertising about the ""addictive"" experience of their games. Proper recognition of the risk of video game over-use or addiction provides a rationale for setting standards of guidance for parents and gamers regarding appropriate limits to gaming.
 
Video game addiction is being increasingly recognized by researchers and other professionals. The American Medical Association (AMA) took a lead role in compiling research supporting the idea of video game addiction in 2007, concluding that the ""AMA strongly encourages the consideration and inclusion of 'internet/video game addiction' as a formal diagnostic disorder.""
 
However, both the AMA and the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) backed off from this position later in 2007, saying more research was needed before video game addiction could be recognized as an addiction. A release by the American Psychiatric Association around the same time stated:
 
""Since the current edition, DSM-IV-TR does not list 'video game addiction, the APA does not consider 'video game addiction' to be a mental disorder at this time... Revising DSM requires a years-long, rigorous process — one that is transparent and open to suggestions from our colleagues in the medical and mental health communities and the public. All changes to DSM will be based on the latest and best science.""
 
Several research studies have been conducted that indicate video game addiction is real in around 10% of gamers. Grüsser et al (2007) found that pathological gamers differed from regular gamers in terms of daily time spent playing, and had higher ""expected relief of withdrawal symptoms when gaming,"" and higher ""craving due to the expectation of a positive outcome of gaming."" These are all characteristics which mirror those of substance dependence.
 
Skoric et al (2009) showed that video game addiction is independent of simply how much time is spent playing, and how engaged children are with the game. In their study, addiction tendencies were negatively related to scholastic performance, while no such relationship was found for either time spent playing games or for video game engagement. A similar pattern of video game addiction is negatively related to scholastic performance was previously found in a separate study by Chiu et al (2004).
 
Charlton's (2002) factor analysis provided support for computer addiction as a unique concept. This research demonstrated the importance of recognizing the specific characteristics of computer addiction, rather than simply adapting measures of pathological gambling, which are likely to overestimate the occurrence of computer addiction.
 
Recognition of video game addiction would allow support services to be integrated into community addiction settings, and specific training to be provided to staff. This is particularly important given the high incidence of concurrent disorders among those with video game addiction.
 
Video game playing may have several advantages. Proficiency in video games can develop the self-esteem of the player. It can develop eye-hand coordination and can have other educational features. More sophisticated games can help players to develop other skills, and recent developments have built-in aspects of physical exercise — although this may have limited appeal to gamers.
 
The reality of popular culture is that we are more and more dependent on technology. A generation ago, computers were complicated and difficult to use, but modern computers are more user-friendly and are relatively easy and enjoyable for the majority of people to use. Video games allow people to have positive experiences of using computers, that can provide transferable skills for using computers for a variety of purposes.
 
Bearing in mind the potential positive effects of video game playing, to label the activity an addiction without sufficient evidence and interpretive guidelines about what constitutes addiction (as opposed to benign or positive game playing) could deter many children and their parents who could possibly benefit from video games. This would be a mistake.
 
There is wide variation in video games, and although some appear to have harmful effects, particularly through the promotion of violence and other anti-social behaviors, this is a function of the content of specific games, rather than a characteristic of video games per se. Video games as a medium have equal potential to develop positive social skills, or to provide benign forms of entertainment — although these may not be as easily marketable to kids.
 
As with other addictions, there is a risk that a label like a video game addiction could be used too liberally, without paying attention to other concurrent or underlying conditions, such as attentional problems, autism spectrum disorders, depression and anxiety disorders. These conditions have different treatments which might more effectively help the excessive game player.
 
And video game addiction is vulnerable to the same criticism that all behavioral addictions are — that addictions are a chemical problem resulting from the intake of addictive substances, not a pattern of behavior.
 
In the same release in which they withdrew their recommendation that video game addiction is recognized, the APA expressed serious concern about the consequences of excessive video game playing in children, stating:
 
""Psychiatrists are concerned about the well-being of children who spend so much time with video games that they fail to develop friendships, get appropriate outdoor exercise or suffer in their schoolwork. Certainly, a child who spends an excessive amount of time playing video games may be exposed to violence and may be at higher risks for behavioral and other health problems.""
 
Therefore, whether or not video game addiction is acknowledged as a real addiction, or even as a mental health problem in and of itself, the APA is clear that excessive video game playing in children can be unhealthy, and can lead to other problems.

Cell phone addiction may not be formally recognized, but for many people, the thought of not having their cell phone is impossible. As we become more and more dependent on cell phones to connect with others, organize our time, and track down information, it can seem hard to cope without it.
 
For many people, looking at their cell phone had become a new way of navigating the social complexities of modern life. It has become a way of avoiding uncomfortable situations, as we pick up our phone to avoid unwanted attention from others, a way of meeting potential partners, thought sites like Tinder, and a way of getting constant validation by posting online and seeking ""likes.""
 
But staying hyperconnected can interfere with your engagement in real relationships and experiences, can cause aches and pains, and interfere with sleep. It can even lead to internet addiction if you are constantly online and unable to switch off.
 
So what should you do when you want to disconnect from your cell phone and find it difficult? These tips can help.
 
Meet Face-to-Face
 
Whether for business or pleasure, arrange to meet in person rather than relying on the ease of texting or talking on the phone. Replace your cell phone with face to face communication. 
 
If you have news and you know you could see a friend later in the day, resist texting or posting your news on Facebook. Wait until you see your friend, then tell them your news verbally. This will prevent your verbal and social skills from deteriorating through overuse of texting to communicate—a big problem for people with computer addiction.
 
When you are with someone else, turn off or ignore your phone if it rings—taking a call in the middle of a conversation is the height of poor netiquette.
 
Choose Real Over Virtual Experiences
 
Make a conscious choice to have real rather than virtual experiences. Instead of checking the internet for information, head to the library and pick up a book. Instead of playing video games, join a team or a chess club. Get out to see live entertainers, rather than viewing everything online.
 You may like the simplicity and efficiency of doing everything from your cell phone, but this won't provide you with the best or most meaningful experiences. 
This will improve your physical and mental health, and reduce addictive patterns of behavior. And you might just find the real world is more dynamic, multi-faceted and enjoyable than the virtual world.
 
Save the Bedroom for Sleep and Sex
 
A central component of good sleep habits, keeping your bedroom for sleep and sex, and leaving your cell phone in another room of the house will not only improve your sleep quality. 
 
It will reduce the likelihood that texting and phoning will encroach on your personal time. And if you are depending on your cell phone for sexting, internet porn, or other cybersex activities, your sex life may be heading for trouble.
 
Value the Empty Spaces in Your Day
 
One of the reasons we become dependent on our cell phones is because it is so easy to take them out every time you have an empty space in your day. 
 
An unfortunate consequence of this is that it can feel like a waste of time whenever you aren't checking your emails when you aren't engaged in another activity. Yet the empty spaces are important for being comfortable with yourself, and the process of just being, which is an important part of mental wellness. Practicing mindfulness can help.
 
Set Your Own Limits
 
Instead of automatically thinking you should have your cell phone to hand at all times, set limits around when you will or will not look at it. 
 
Deliberately leave it out of reach when you would really rather focus on some other part of your experience. You can always return calls or reply to emails later.

Between texts, emails, an increasing array of social media options and other apps, most of us have smartphones now, and most of us are more tied to them than perhaps we should be. While it used to be considered rude to check your phone when out to dinner or otherwise engaged with people in real life, constant phone-checking has become more and more commonplace.
 According to a survey from the American Psychological Association (APA), constantly checking your smartphone has been linked with stress. 
The APA's annual Stress in America survey was released in two parts in 2017, with the first section focusing on coping with change and the second installment focusing on the stress of technology and social media. There are several findings that are interesting and relevant to most of us. It is clear that technology and the use of social media is affecting our stress levels, happiness, and wellbeing. One of the most salient findings is that many of us check our phones too often, and this is linked to higher levels of stress. Here are more details on this, and on other important aspects of the survey.
 
According to the survey, 74% of Americans own an internet-connected smartphone. Additionally, 55% own a tablet, and roughly nine in 10 have a computer. We are connected.
 
While only 7% of adults in America used social media in 2005 (remember MySpace?), a full 65% were connected to social media in 2015. Young adults (18-29) are even more connected, with fully 90% connected via social media in 2015 (compared to 12% in 2005). The numbers are trending upward as social media is connecting us more and more.
 
In 2016, of adults who were online, 79% were connected to Facebook, making it by far the most popular social media platform among adults in America. Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn were used by 32%, 31%, and 29%, respectively. Twitter is slightly less popular, but almost one in four (24%) use it nonetheless. Again, we are connected!
 
While this is a relatively new phenomenon, this rise in use of social media and internet-connected devices has led to many people habitually checking their phones for texts, email, and social media posts. What was once perhaps a way to pass time while waiting in line or a way to remain on top of emergencies at work has now become a habitual behavior that many of us perform without thinking.
 According to the survey, 43% of Americans report that they constantly check their phones 
Almost one in five (18%) report that technology use is a very or somewhat significant source of stress. Also interesting is the fact that those who constantly check their phones are more likely to find technology to be somewhat or significantly stressful—23% versus 14% of non-checkers. There are several reasons for this:
 
A majority of us (65%) agree (""somewhat"" or ""strongly"") that taking a digital break, or ""unplugging"" from time to time is important for mental health. Again, somewhat ironically, only 28% of those who believe in the importance of this type of cutting back report actually doing so. The reasons behind this are somewhat complicated.
 
In addition to mere habit, there are benefits to social media that are particularly felt by Millennials. Within that group, 36% say that social media has helped them to cultivate their identity in some way, though roughly half (48%) also worry about the negative effects on their physical and mental health, compared to only 15% of ""Matures,"" 22% of Baby Boomers, and 37% of Gen X-ers.
 
Currently, we are trying to at least set limits on our constant phone-checking. In the survey, 28% (and 32% of parents) report banning the use of phones during dinner, which is a nice way to practice more mindful eating and connect with those around us. People also report turning off social media notifications (19%), though there are other ways to cut down as well.
 
People are on the right track. Limiting use of phones at dinner is a simple way to take a small break from social media availability and focus on the people you are with in real life.
 Turning off notifications is a good idea as a way to avoid constant reminders that someone, somewhere, has said something that may require our attention and remove it from the people who are in front of us. 
This can also be a way to practice limiting use at other times, as you become more used to having your phone turned off or in another room. Here are some additional strategies that can work:
 Political and Cultural Discussions: More than two-fifths of frequent phone-checkers (42%) report that political discussions and cultural disagreements on social media cause them stress, compared to 33% of those who aren't considered constant checkers. This is understandable, considering that conflict is a stressful experience for most people, and engaging in a conflict-laden environment more often may lead to more stress. Effects on Health: Poorly managed stress has been linked to several negative health outcomes, and previous surveys have found that many Americans are concerned by the effects of stress on their health. This survey was no different: 42% are concerned about the negative effects of social media on their physical and mental health (compared to 27% of non-checkers). This is probably a valid concern, as it has been found that social media social comparison is linked with decreased happiness and wellbeing, and increased levels of stress as well. And unmanaged stress can take a toll on health in multiple ways. Feeling Disconnected: Ironically, those who check social media the most tend to be those who feel the least connected. 44% of constant checkers report feeling disconnected from their family and friends even when they are with them. (This is compared to only 27% of non-checkers who feel this way.) They attribute this feeling to be the result of technology. Interestingly, however, instead of unplugging, 35% of phone-checkers report that they are less likely to get together with friends or family in person because of the availability of social media. (By comparison, only 15% of non-checkers report the same.) Loneliness can also take a toll on health and happiness, as loneliness has its own dangers and can even be considered ""contagious."" This connection has created a real disconnect. Go Offline at Certain Times of Day: If you create windows when you are not available (like dinnertime, after a certain time of night, or even every other hour), you begin to teach yourself how to limit your availability. You also teach others not to expect you to be constantly available. This small boundary may make it easier to disconnect at other times and in other ways. Become Comfortable with ""Sleep Mode"": Putting your phone on ""sleep mode"" and only checking it once an hour is a good way to keep notifications functional but silent, so you can choose when to let them interrupt your day. This puts you in greater control. Ask People to Call You On It: Enlist help by announcing that you'd like to check your phone less when you are with people. You can even make a pact with others that none of you will be on your phones when you are together, as in ""olden times"" (like 2005). This can help you to stay connected with those you're with, and make it into a game of sorts, rather than something you try to do alone. Delete Your Apps: If you delete social media apps on your phone, you'll be forced to only use them when you are at your computer or tablet. This makes it more challenging to maintain a mindless habit of checking your phone, but it doesn't cut you off entirely. The idea is to make yourself think about it more, and to make social media less available—but not completely inaccessible. Try Meditation: Because checking your phone can be such an insidious habit, it's easy to do it without thinking. Getting into a new habit like meditation can help you to become more conscious of the present moment, the here and now. That can also help you to get into the practice of being here, now, rather than wondering who else is saying something online. Practice being fully present and it will become easier to keep your phone in your pocket.",texts email increase array social media options apps smartphones tie perhaps use consider rude check phone dinner otherwise engage people real life constant phone check become commonplace accord survey american psychological association apa constantly check smartphone link stress apa annual stress america survey release two part first section focus cop change second installment focus stress technology social media several find interest relevant clear technology use social media affect stress level happiness wellbeing one salient find many check phone often link higher level stress detail important aspects survey accord survey americans internet connect smartphone additionally tablet roughly nine computer connect adults america use social media remember myspace full connect social media young adults even connect fully connect via social media compare number trend upward social media connect adults online connect facebook make far popular social media platform among adults america instagram pinterest linkedin use respectively twitter slightly less popular almost one four use nonetheless connect relatively new phenomenon rise use social media internet connect devices lead many people habitually check phone texts email social media post perhaps way pass time wait line way remain top emergencies work become habitual behavior many perform without think accord survey americans report constantly check phone almost one five report technology use somewhat significant source stress also interest fact constantly check phone likely find technology somewhat significantly stressful versus non checker several reason majority agree somewhat strongly take digital break unplug time time important mental health somewhat ironically believe importance type cut back report actually reason behind somewhat complicate addition mere habit benefit social media particularly felt millennials within group say social media help cultivate identity way though roughly half also worry negative effect physical mental health compare mature baby boomers gen ers currently try least set limit constant phone check survey parent report ban use phone dinner nice way practice mindful eat connect around people also report turn social media notifications though ways cut well people right track limit use phone dinner simple way take small break social media availability focus people real life turn notifications good idea way avoid constant reminders someone somewhere say something may require attention remove people front also way practice limit use time become use phone turn another room additional strategies work political cultural discussions two fifths frequent phone checker report political discussions cultural disagreements social media cause stress compare consider constant checker understandable consider conflict stressful experience people engage conflict lade environment often may lead stress effect health poorly manage stress link several negative health outcomes previous survey find many americans concern effect stress health survey different concern negative effect social media physical mental health compare non checker probably valid concern find social media social comparison link decrease happiness wellbeing increase level stress well unmanaged stress take toll health multiple ways feel disconnect ironically check social media tend feel least connect constant checker report feel disconnect family friends even compare non checker feel way attribute feel result technology interestingly however instead unplug phone checker report less likely get together friends family person availability social media comparison non checker report loneliness also take toll health happiness loneliness dangers even consider contagious connection create real disconnect offline certain time day create windows available like dinnertime certain time night even every hour begin teach limit availability also teach others expect constantly available small boundary may make easier disconnect time ways become comfortable sleep mode put phone sleep mode check hour good way keep notifications functional silent choose let interrupt day put greater control ask people call enlist help announce like check phone less people even make pact others none phone together olden time like help stay connect make game sort rather something try alone delete apps delete social media apps phone force use computer tablet make challenge maintain mindless habit check phone cut entirely idea make think make social media less available completely inaccessible try meditation check phone insidious habit easy without think get new habit like meditation help become conscious present moment also help get practice rather wonder else say something online practice fully present become easier keep phone pocket

Social media originated as a way for people to connect with family and friends, even if they were thousands of miles apart. But over the years, it has transformed. Now, social media is used in a variety of different ways and a lot more frequently. For instance, businesses, non-profit organizations, and even politicians use it as a way to reach a very targeted market.
 
Meanwhile, teens and young adults use social media as a virtual scrapbook to document every detail of their life as they are living it. There are even ""influencers"" with large social media followings, that use their following as a way to promote a product, service, or group through social media and gain support for it. Social media is even a valuable resource for and a means of connecting isolated populations with other parts of the world.
 
In many ways, social media has enriched our lives by connecting and inspiring people. But there is a dark side as well. Aside from all the negative posts on social media, the cyberbullying, and the FOMO (fear of missing out) that exists, recent studies indicate that excessive social media use not only leads to poor decision-making, but people who use social media incessantly often have attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors that mimic those of a drug addict.
 
Researchers at Michigan State University have found that people who report using social media a lot tend to struggle with decision-making. As part of their study, participants answered questions about their social media use. The questions were tailored to see how dependent people were on social media, as well as how they felt when they couldn't use it and how they would feel about never using it again.
 
After the survey, the participants completed a common psychological task known as the Iowa Gambling Task, which helps gauge value-based decision-making skills. During the task, the goal is for the participants to collect as much money as possible. The researchers found that those participants who spent more time on social media were likely to have less money at the end of the task. Meanwhile, those who spent less time on social media finished the task with more money.
 Because this type of deficit in decision-making skills often goes hand-in-hand with drug addiction as well as a gambling addiction, the researchers likened the results of excessive social media use to aspects of an addiction. 
In another study, researchers explored what it would ""cost"" for certain participants to deactivate their Facebook profiles for up to one year. Consequently, experimental auctions revealed that it would anywhere from $1,000 to more than $2,000 for participants to cancel their Facebook profiles for that length of time.
 
Still, some users refused to bid at all, which researchers believe signaled their dependence on Facebook and their unwillingness to even consider deactivating their accounts. These results show just how dependent, or addicted to, social media some people are that they would not even consider deactivating their accounts for a year, despite being paid.
 
For some people, the thought of not being able to check their social media accounts causes them to break out in a cold sweat. They get nervous and anxious and are not sure how to handle the situation. When this occurs, therapists often refer to this as social media anxiety disorder, which may share similarities to social anxiety disorder.
 
This connection is not surprising given that anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorder in the United States; and technology seems to be making things worse. In fact, appears that the more technology people acquire, the more stressed out they become.
 
For instance, researchers estimate that 20 percent of people with social media accounts cannot go more than three hours without checking them; and for people with social media anxiety disorder, just being away from their social media accounts for just a few minutes can cause severe anxiety.
 
Aside from the obvious anxiety and nervousness that being away from social media can cause some people, there are some other telltale signs that they may have an addiction to social media. These include everything from isolating themselves from others, losing interest in activities they once found enjoyable, and getting agitated, angry, or anxious when they are unable to check social media. Following is a closer look at some of the signs that you (or your teen) may be hooked on social media:
 
Anxiety, agitation, or anger when you cannot check social media. Not being able to check social media is not a life-threatening situation. But, for some people, not being able to get online and check their status and their updates can feel like one. Even though they may feel embarrassed or confused by their reactions, they often feel like they cannot control their feelings or their situation.
 
Interrupt conversations to check social media. Sometimes people can be so obsessed with the online world that they have trouble staying in the moment or paying attention to what others are saying. Consequently, their faces are often buried in their phones; or, they may appear distracted and constantly check their phones.
 
Lie to others about how much time is spent online. Most people who struggle with social media addiction are embarrassed by how much time they spend online. So, they lie to their loved ones about how much they are scrolling social media. They know they should not be online so much, but they just cannot help it.
 
Withdraw from family and friends. When social media addiction progresses, it can become consuming of a person's time and energy. As a result, a person with an addiction to social media will withdraw from family and friends and spend most of their time in the virtual world.
 
Lose interest in other activities. As social media takes up more and more time, it becomes the most important thing in a person's life. Consequently, the addicted person will spend the bulk of their time on social media and very little time doing the things they once loved.
 
Neglect school or work in favor of social media. One hallmark of addiction, is the way that it consumes a person's time, energy, and attention. For this reason, many people with social media addiction often neglect their schoolwork or their work assignments because they cannot tear themselves away from social media.
 
Experience negative impacts to your personal or professional life. One of the biggest indicators that you or your teen has a problem with social media is when it starts interfering with your life in a negative way. For instance, grades start dropping and deadlines are missed for school or work are definite indicators that there is a problem.
 
Feel stressed and that your life is lacking. It is important to remind yourself (and your teen) that what you see on social media is just another person's highlight reel. They have normal, boring days filled with work and obligations just like everyone else. Remind yourself that if social media makes you think that your life is boring, it is not going to get any better sitting there obsessing about it. You have to get out and enjoy your life - experience it - not just document it.
 
Whether you want to monitor your social media use, your teens' use, or both, there are a number of steps you can take to see not only how often you are using social media, but also to determine if you are using it in healthy and productive ways.
 
When notifications from social media ping on your phone all day, every day, it can be challenging not to toggle over to your social media accounts and see what is happening.
 
For this reason, it can be extremely useful, and preventative, to turn off the notifications on your social media accounts. This way, instead of social media beckoning you to check out what people are posting or saying, you are in control. As a result, you are free to check social media at times that are convenient for you rather than feeling you should check right away when your phone pings.
 
Meanwhile, you may want to turn on notifications for when your kids post to their social media accounts.
 In other words, you can set up notifications on your account to notify you know anytime your teen posts something on their social media account. This way, you can see what they are posting, how often they are posting, and determine if they need some tips on digital etiquette or to take something down. 
With notifications, hopefully you see a questionable post before too many other people do.
 
On some social media accounts, like Facebook, you can set guidelines that allow you to see certain social media posts first. What's more, you also can indicate who your ""close friends"" are so that you get notifications when they post. (You can still get notifications when they post that do not alert your phone immediately. Instead, these notifications are only listed in the notifications tab.)
 
When you set up these types of parameters on social media, you are making it work for you instead of allowing it to push you into behaving or interacting in a certain way. Additionally, these types of parameters make it much easier to just see what you want on social media rather than scrolling through every post in your feed. This way, it is much easier to limit the time you spend on social media.
 
One of the best ways to get a picture of how you or your teen is using social media, is to conduct a social media audit. Take a look at the posts, photos, and comments. Then consider what these things say about you and your social media use.
 
For instance, are you posting every day, multiple times a day? Or do you go days or even weeks without posting? If you find that you are posting every day, multiple times per day, you may want to take a closer look at how much time you are spending on social media.
 Your social media audit could be your first clue that things are starting to go off the tracks somewhat. 
Whether you use your phone's settings or get a free app like Quality Time, there are countless ways to manage your time and track how much time you are spending not only on your phone but also on social media, Netflix, and online gaming.
 
Once you know how you are spending your time, you will be able to set goals and limits for your social media use. Additionally, some apps allow you to add family members so that you can all disconnect or unplug together as well as keep one another accountable.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Social media is a fun way to document and share your life, especially with friends or relatives that live far away. But just as with anything else in life, there is such a thing as too much. If you find that you (or your teen) are spending a lot time on social media, and it makes you anxious when you cannot check your posts or see what others are doing, then that is a red flag that something is wrong. It is time to take some steps to cut back and truly experience life around you rather than just document it.
 
Additionally, if you are showing signs of social media anxiety, or if you feel like social media is impacting your decision-making, you may want to schedule some time with a counselor or therapist. They can help you work through your anxiety and make sense of your feelings as well as provide you with ideas on how to make healthy changes in your life.

Caffeine addiction is the excessive and/or harmful use of caffeine over a period of time, which has negative effects on your health, social interactions, or other areas of your life. As caffeine is a widely accepted and used drug, many people don't believe caffeine can be addictive.
 
While most caffeine users feel they enjoy many of the effects of caffeine, like a good ""morning boost,"" they may not be aware of some of the negative effects the drug is having, such as disrupted sleep, irritability, and anxiety. Many people, for example, get into a vicious cycle of drinking coffee to increase energy, only to find themselves both fatigued and unable to relax at bedtime. 
 
Some people experience significant problems as a result of their caffeine use, have difficulty coping without caffeine, and experience other unpleasant side effects as a result. There have even been isolated cases of caffeine overdose.
 
Caffeine is one of the most widely used addictive substances, and it is heavily marketed to adults, teens, and even children. While coffee is probably the most frequently used source of caffeine, it is also present in many common foods and drinks, so your caffeine intake might be higher than you realize.
 Caffeine intoxication is recognized in the DSM-5, the manual used by clinicians to classify and diagnose mental health concerns, and caffeine use disorder is identified as requiring further study. 
Caffeine intoxication and caffeine withdrawal can both be very unpleasant, physically and psychologically, but either can easily be mistaken for a variety of other conditions. For example, people who are intoxicated with caffeine can exhibit similar symptoms as people with attention deficit disorders; caffeine withdrawal shares similar symptoms with mood disorders.
 
Caffeine addiction can cause and exacerbate many different health problems.﻿﻿ Gradually reducing your daily caffeine intake by increasingly mixing caffeinated beverages with non-caffeinated drinks is the best way to quit caffeine without withdrawal symptoms.
 
Caffeine has various effects on the body which are potentially harmful to health. Caffeine increases heart rate and can cause abnormalities in the heartbeat, so is not recommended for people with cardiovascular problems.﻿﻿ It also increases blood pressure and affects bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.
 
As caffeine is a stimulant drug, caffeine intoxication causes a cluster of symptoms associated with stimulation of the brain and nervous system. While caffeine users enjoy the increased energy and alertness that caffeine gives them, unpleasant symptoms experienced by many consumers, especially those who are addicted, include:
 
Caffeine withdrawal typically causes a rebound effect, producing symptoms that are the opposite of the effects of intoxication. This effect can be profound in those who are addicted to caffeine.
 
The symptom most often noticed by people going through caffeine withdrawal is a severe, intense headache. When coming off caffeine, people often feel very tired and even drowsy. They may have difficulty concentrating, and feel depressed or irritable.
 Occasionally, people withdrawing from caffeine also experience flu-like symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain or stiffness. 
As with all addictions, the pattern of intoxication and withdrawal can mask emotional difficulties that are avoided by seeking out the pleasurable effects of caffeine. Lack of energy, lack of motivation, and depression may underlie caffeine addiction.
 
It can also overlap with work addiction, as some people use the stimulating effects of caffeine both to increase energy for and interest in the mental and physical activities associated with their jobs. Similarly, caffeine addiction can mask the avoidance of more fulfilling activities and relationships.
 
The stimulating effects of caffeine can cause physical symptoms and behaviors that can look and feel like, and therefore be easily confused with, other disorders. Therefore, it is important to let your doctor or psychologist know how much caffeine you are consuming, and how frequently you are doing so, if you are being assessed for any condition.
 
For example, caffeine intoxication produces symptoms that can easily be confused with anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks. Using too much caffeine can also worsen symptoms of anxiety disorders in people who are affected, intensifying feelings of worry; increasing racing thoughts; making it difficult to quiet the mind; increasing agitation and shakiness; and preventing relaxation and quality (or any) sleep.
 
However, you might experience your use of caffeine as calming and temporarily relieving of anxiety. You may feel and even believe it helps you cope.
 
Other health concerns caffeine intoxication can be confused with:﻿﻿
 
It can also be mistaken for, and worsen symptoms of, withdrawal from other substances, such as amphetamines and cocaine. Stimulant drugs are often cut with caffeine, increasingly the likelihood that caffeine withdrawal is involved in withdrawal from these drugs.
 When a disorder is induced by a substance, although it is triggered by substance use, it does meet the criteria for the disorder, rather than simply being an effect of intoxication or withdrawal. Caffeine-induced disorders include caffeine-induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-induced sleep disorder. 
Addiction involves not only excessive use of caffeine but also relying on caffeine to cope with life, typically in spite of negative effects. To figure out whether you might be addicted:
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
If you feel that your responses to any of the above seem alarming, speak to your healthcare provider. If you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about your caffeine intake as soon as possible. Similarly, if you have another health condition that might be impacted by caffeine use, such as a cardiovascular problem, discuss options with your doctor right away.﻿﻿
 
The vicious cycle of addiction happens with caffeine just as it does with other addictive substances. As the effects of caffeine wear off, you might feel a crash in energy and that you can't keep going without another boost of caffeine.﻿﻿
 
As withdrawal can make you feel worse, it is important for most people to reduce caffeine intake gradually rather than abruptly to get the maximum benefit from quitting or reducing caffeine. Your doctor can help you devise a plan.
 
If you feel you are using caffeine to cope with an emotional problem, such as depression or anxiety, also talk to your physician about options for treating these conditions. The right treatment could make a huge difference for you.
 
Caffeine addiction often overlaps with other behavioral addictions,﻿﻿ such as sugar addiction. You might find that evaluating your caffeine intake opens up a Pandora's box of other behaviors that need to be addressed.
 
If you don't feel you are addicted to caffeine, but you do feel you are consuming more than is healthy, you can choose to either reduce your caffeine intake or cut out caffeine altogether. The most common mistake, in either case, is to cut down by too much too soon, causing you to relapse due to an intense headache.﻿﻿
 Instead of cutting your caffeine intake in half, try reducing your regular intake by about 10% every two weeks; reduce the strength of your last caffeinated drink of the day by diluting it with an uncaffeinated drink. 
Caffeine addiction is so common we don't even notice it most of the time. But when you are able to greatly reduce or quit caffeine, the feeling of getting back in touch with your own natural energy, and having the ability to relax when night falls, is unparalleled.

Calculate how much caffeine you are actually consuming on a typical day, including gourmet espresso, lattes, and cappuccino, which are typically much stronger than regular drip or instant coffee, soda, and other common caffeine-containing foods and drinks. Pay attention to how you feel. Make a note of any side effects of caffeine, as well as withdrawal symptoms that happen if you miss a regular dose of caffeine. Consider the effects. Think about the effects of caffeine or withdrawal symptoms you experience if you miss a regular dose, and how they affect your feelings, functioning, and relationships.﻿﻿ Do you get irritable if you have too much or too little caffeine?

There are several reasons to quit caffeine. Your caffeine intake might be giving you bothersome side effects, or maybe those expensive specialty coffees from coffee shops are just costing too much. But as soon as you stop consuming caffeine, you experience uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.﻿﻿
 
Most people who regularly consume caffeinated beverages are familiar with at least some of the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal. If you skip your morning coffee, you might start to feel some of these unpleasant effects just a few hours later, which can range from fairly mild to more severe depending on your regular caffeine intake.
 
Headaches are perhaps the single most common sign of withdrawal. Irritability and fatigue are also frequent. These negative symptoms then lead people to grab a caffeinated drink to find some relief.
 Caffeine withdrawal is now recognized as a disorder in the DSM-5, the manual used by most clinicians for the diagnosis of mental disorders. 
Not sure if you have caffeine withdrawal symptoms? Research has shown that these are the most common symptoms reported by those withdrawing from caffeine.
 
The hallmark caffeine withdrawal symptom is a severe headache, which bears many similarities to a migraine headache.﻿﻿ Like migraines, it is accompanied by vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels) in the head and neck, and like migraines, it can take the form of hemicrania or a headache on only one side of the head.
 
Many of the other caffeine withdrawal symptoms are similar to those experienced during a migraine.
 
Nausea and stomach upset are much more common caffeine withdrawal symptoms than vomiting, but both are recognized. Nausea is that unpleasant sensation of queasiness or feeling as if you are about to vomit.
 
Often technically referred to as dysphoria, caffeine withdrawal causes a variety of negative mood states, ranging from feeling depressed to feeling anxious or irritable.﻿﻿ Keep in mind that these feelings are usually temporary and should pass once the withdrawal is over.
 
This symptom is described in various ways, but all add up to the same thing—your brain doesn't work as efficiently when you are withdrawing from caffeine.﻿﻿ Lab tests show that this is more than just a feeling; performance actually is poorer on mental tasks.
 
Remember this is a rebound effect from the stimulating and performance-enhancing effects of caffeine. Drinking more caffeine will simply perpetuate the cycle. But you don't have to quit cold turkey—you can ""taper off"" caffeine.
 
The sense of being light-headed or dizzy is a common withdrawal symptom of caffeine.﻿﻿ Cutting down gradually rather than abruptly will help, but don't push yourself. Try to take things a little easier while you are cutting back on caffeine, and sit down or lie down if you feel the need. While fainting is uncommon, pushing yourself while you are feeling lightheaded or dizzy increases the risk.
 Symptoms of withdrawal usually start within 12 to 24 hours after your last dose, and the entire withdrawal process can last between two and 10 days.  
Numerous studies have shown that the easiest and most effective way to relieve caffeine withdrawal symptoms is by taking more caffeine. The key is to be careful with how much. Check out the amount of caffeine in common foods and drinks and make sure you don't increase your caffeine intake beyond the amount you were using before, as this will build up your tolerance, which will potentially feed your caffeine addiction.
 A good way to taper your caffeine intake is by reducing it by about 10% every two weeks. That way, you will reduce your caffeine intake enough that eventually you will be caffeine-free, but it will take several months to get there. 
The advantage of tapering your caffeine intake is that you shouldn't have very noticeable withdrawal symptoms while cutting back, and you can gradually replace your caffeinated foods and drinks with un-caffeinated or decaffeinated versions.
 
Start by keeping a caffeine diary, and writing down all the foods and drinks containing caffeine that you consume.﻿﻿ Be sure to check the labels of any painkillers or supplements to see if they include caffeine.
 
Then gradually start to reduce your caffeine intake by 10%, continuing to keep a daily record. There are a few ways of doing this. Some people reduce each caffeinated drink by 10% and dilute it by adding hot or cold water or decaffeinated coffee or tea. Others find it easier to reduce the actual number of drinks by 10%, so if you have five cups of coffee per day, replace one cup with a half cup for the first two weeks, then by a whole cup the next two weeks, and so on.
 Decaffeinated coffee has been found to actually reduce caffeine withdrawal symptoms including cravings, fatigue, lack of alertness, and flu-like feelings when people going through caffeine withdrawal think they are drinking caffeinated coffee. This is known as the placebo effect. 
As your withdrawal symptoms diminish, you might find it helpful to substitute a noncaffeinated drink, such as herbal tea, water, or decaffeinated coffee or tea, for each drink you remove, so you gradually develop a taste for drinks that do not contain caffeine.
 
If you are using the drink replacement strategy, it is easiest to work backward from the last drink of the day. This will have the bonus effect of helping you sleep better at night.
 
One important thing to note is that while the Food and Drug Administration requires foods containing added caffeine to carry a label, it is not a requirement to label foods that naturally contain caffeine. Because of this, it can be difficult to monitor and track your daily caffeine intake. Try to be aware of what products may contain caffeine and always read the labels on any food products or beverages that you consume.
 
Mood changes typically disappear as you overcome withdrawal. If your negative mood lingers once you are through with caffeine, talk to your doctor about how you are feeling. Sometimes mental health problems underlie an addiction, and only become apparent once you have quit, in which case, your doctor can provide or refer you to appropriate treatment. Sometimes a mental health problem can also be triggered by drug use, including caffeine use. Again, your doctor is the best person to advise you, so don't suffer in silence.
 Use caution with over-the-counter treatments for a headache or other withdrawal symptoms. Many of these pain relievers contain caffeine, so always check the label. 
Caffeine withdrawal usually passes fairly quickly and most symptoms are fairly mild and manageable with self-care and pain relievers. The key to giving up caffeine in the long-term is to be aware of consumables that contain the stimulant and watch your intake carefully. After you have gone through the withdrawal process, it can be easy to unknowingly start drinking or eating larger doses of caffeine than you intended. Familiarize yourself with foods and drinks that contain caffeine and be aware of medications that may also contain the stimulant.
 
If you find yourself taking in too much caffeine again in the future, be prepared to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Start once again tapering your intake to slowly wean yourself off of caffeine or reduce your intake to lower levels.
 
If you are trying to kick the caffeine habit, there are resources that can help. Try using a mobile app to help you keep track of your daily intake. This sort of tool can give you a better idea of just how much caffeine you are taking each day as well as when you usually consume the most caffeine. With this information, you can start planning dietary changes that will help you reduce your daily consumption.
 Talk to your doctor if you need additional help managing your caffeine withdrawal symptoms. You can also use the American Psychological Association's psychologist locator tool to find mental health professionals in your area who can offer assistance. 
While caffeine is widely used, there can be health benefits to reducing or eliminating your daily consumption of this stimulant, particularly if you are experiencing negative side effects. Fortunately, caffeine withdrawal is usually something that you can safely cope with a gradual tapering strategy.

There are three common types of gambler, the professional gambler, the social gambler, and the problem gambler. Be aware that the problem gambler will often believe themselves to be, or pretend to be, a social or professional gambler.
 
Professional gamblers are the rarest form of gambler and depend on games of skills rather than luck to make money. They have full control over the time, money and energy they spend on gambling. Social gamblers consider gambling to be a valid form of recreational activity and maintain full control over the time, money and energy they expend on gambling. They consider the cost of gambling to be payment for entertainment.
 
Problem gambling involves the continued involvement in gambling activities, despite negative consequences. Gamblers can have a problem without being totally out of control. Problem gambling is any gambling behavior that disrupts your life. If you’re preoccupied with gambling, spending more and more time and money on it, or gambling despite serious consequences, you have a gambling problem.
 
Gambling addiction is an impulse-control disorder in which sufferers cannot control the impulse to gamble despite the fact that it is causing problems in their lives and the lives of their loved ones.
 All gambling addicts are problem gamblers, although not all problem gamblers have a gambling addiction. 
While there are no obvious symptoms or physical signs of gambling addiction as there are in other types of addictions such as drug and alcohol, there are some red flags that signal a problem: 
 
Often, many things contribute to a gambling addiction, including biological, genetic and environmental factor.
 
Addicted gamblers may notice they feel desperate for money, get a thrill or high from gambling, seek the social status of a successful gambler, and have other mood and behavior disorders that contribute to or result from their gambling addiction. 
 
Like other addictions, breaking the cycle of gambling addiction can be very difficult. Feeling like you may be able to win back the money you've lost may fuel the problem. While quitting gambling is not easy, it can be done. There are three main methods of helping patients overcome gambling addiction. They include: 
 Feeling the need to be secretive about gambling.  Feeling a high or thrill from making big bets Using gambling as a way to escape life's challenges Gambling even when money is not available and accumulating debt Having family and friends who worry about your gambling.  Continuing to gamble despite the consequences.  Having another behavior or mood disorder.  Psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, focuses on teaching skills to change the thoughts and behaviors that lead to gambling.  Medications such as antidepressants and mood stabilizers may be helpful for patients who have other psychiatric disorders that accompany their gambling problem like depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or ADHD. In addition, certain medications known as narcotic antagonists that have been found useful in treating substance abuse may also be helpful in treating some patients with gambling addiction. Self-help groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous, which can be an extremely helpful part of treatment as well as prevent relapse. ",three common type gambler professional gambler social gambler problem gambler aware problem gambler often believe pretend social professional gambler professional gamblers rarest form gambler depend game skills rather luck make money full control time money energy spend gamble social gamblers consider gamble valid form recreational activity maintain full control time money energy expend gamble consider cost gamble payment entertainment problem gamble involve continue involvement gamble activities despite negative consequences gamblers problem without totally control problem gamble gamble behavior disrupt life preoccupy gamble spend time money gamble despite serious consequences gamble problem gamble addiction impulse control disorder sufferers control impulse gamble despite fact cause problems live live love ones gamble addict problem gamblers although problem gamblers gamble addiction obvious symptoms physical sign gamble addiction type addictions drug alcohol red flag signal problem often many things contribute gamble addiction include biological genetic environmental factor addict gamblers may notice feel desperate money get thrill high gamble seek social status successful gambler mood behavior disorder contribute result gamble addiction like addictions break cycle gamble addiction difficult feel like may able win back money lose may fuel problem quit gamble easy three main methods help patients overcome gamble addiction include feel need secretive gamble feel high thrill make big bet use gamble way escape life challenge gamble even money available accumulate debt family friends worry gamble continue gamble despite consequences another behavior mood disorder psychotherapy include cognitive behavioral therapy focus teach skills change thoughts behaviors lead gamble medications antidepressants mood stabilizers may helpful patients psychiatric disorder accompany gamble problem like depression obsessive compulsive disorder adhd addition certain medications know narcotic antagonists find useful treat substance abuse may also helpful treat patients gamble addiction self help group gamblers anonymous extremely helpful part treatment well prevent relapse

If you've never experienced addiction, it can be hard to understand. Everyone's experience with addiction is unique. This article is intended to encourage an understanding of people with addiction, not to represent or stigmatize any individual or groups.
 
Imagine, for a moment, that you've never really felt comfortable with who you are. It could be because you feel like you've failed at everything you've tried, or because you were never satisfied with the level of success you did achieve. It could be because you've had thoughts and emotions that make you feel different from other people, particularly if you feel that you aren't as good or as lovable as others. Or perhaps you were actually told, or shown, that you were no good, worthless, or that you existed just to meet other people’s needs.
 None of the things that the people around you enjoy feel good to you, and the experiences that bring others satisfaction are hollow and unsatisfying for you. 
Then imagine that you have an experience—you drink, take a drug, win a bet or a game, have a sexual experience, overeat, make a large impulse purchase—and suddenly, everything feels great. You feel as if success is easy and right for you, that perhaps others don’t understand, but now it feels good to be alive. There is finally something you can depend on to be OK.
 
It might be easy to get what feels good: for a person with a food addiction, a quick trip to the corner store and a few dollars can replenish your supply of chips and chocolate. For a person with an addiction to heroin, maintaining a habit can cost a lot of money, entail significant risks, and involve interactions with people you can’t trust. But compared to the emptiness of what you felt before, investing in the chance that you could again feel good about yourself and about being alive is what matters.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
Sure, those around you don't understand why you're doing what you are doing. But this just makes you want to spend time with people who do understand, whose addictions make them feel exactly the way you do. You don’t even need to talk about it with them—between you, there is already an understanding. With them, you don’t feel like an outsider, but like a member of a secret club.
 
There is a steep price to pay for addiction. You may put on or lose weight, experience health problems, lose a lot of money, and destroy relationships. But your reasoning may be that nothing made you feel happy in the past anyway, and, at least for a short time, your addiction does.
 The more people criticize you, the more you want to seek comfort in that good feeling you get from your addiction. The more others lecture you about what you should be doing with your life, the more convinced you are that they don’t know what they are talking about. 
Sure, you wish what they were saying was true, but underneath, you know that a normal life was never for you.
 
Except you long for a normal life. You wish that you could take satisfaction in the things that seem to make other people happy, such as graduation, a career, and a family. But to get those things, or to experience them the way you want to, you would have to believe in yourself and that self-belief has always eluded you.
 
Most people with addiction struggle with a double life. You try to keep your addiction hidden from most people, most of the time, even when it is quite obvious to those around you. You have a hard time admitting to yourself that you are a person with addiction because no matter how fleeting, it gives you that brief moment when everything feels okay. You want to free yourself from your addiction and not end up back where you started, with all the losses you have built up while you have been struggling.
 Recovery is possible for every person with addiction. But facing the problems that caused the addiction in the first place is scary. It's difficult to cope with the deep dissatisfaction with your life and to take responsibility for how your behavior affects other people. 
It means learning how to experience a gentler sense of pleasure in the small things in life and coping with the many challenges and imperfections of life, without retreating back into your addiction. Which means accepting being human, just like everyone else.

Is television or screen addiction real? This is a complicated, hotly debated question. Officially, if you go by the disorders listed in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), the ""bible"" of recognized mental health conditions, the answer is no.﻿﻿ However, countless researchers (and laypeople alike) view screentime overuse as a looming crisis.
 
While scientists and psychologists wrestle over exactly what qualifies as an addiction or disorder, the fallout of TV and screen overuse is plain for most of us (experts, doctors, parents, and teachers included) to see. So, even though TV addiction has not yet made the list, there is still plenty of reason to work toward a healthier relationship with your screens.
 
The idea of television addiction is nothing new and predates the explosion in media and screens of recent years. Worry over too much TV has been conceptualized and discussed since the 1970s, well before some of the behavioral addictions that have since overtaken it in terms of scientific research and widespread acceptance, such as internet addiction.﻿﻿ Although early research into TV addiction was limited, the concept of TV addiction was relatively well accepted by parents, educators, and journalists, as television watching became more common, particularly among children. 
 
Much of the research on screentime has been devoted to its impact on children but, as we all are aware, adults are also prone to overuse.﻿﻿
 
Doctors, teachers, counselors, parents, and even kids are growingly concerned as the quantity of content, types of available media, proliferation of electronic devices, and time spent on screens all soar. According to data in Common Sense Media's 2019 ""The Common Sense Census: Media Use by Tweens and Teens,"" the average teen spends 7 hours, 22 minutes on screens daily—not including for school or homework.﻿﻿
 
Time in front of screens is up significantly from the last survey in 2015, which is even more alarming when you consider that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends significantly less screentime than kids are getting.
 
In 2001, the AAP, citing concerns over possible links of excess screentime to aggressive behavior, poor body image, obesity, and decreased school performance, set a guideline of two hours of screentime maximum for children aged 2 and older and no screens for those under 2.﻿﻿ In 2016, those guidelines were reduced to one hour for children aged 2 to 5, and more open-ended ""consistent limits"" were recommended for kids 6 and up, along with the advice to implement age-appropriate supervision and to teach children media-savvy skills.﻿﻿
 
Clearly, today's children are far surpassing the recommended limits. Smartphone ownership has also increased sharply with 69% of 12-year-olds now having a phone in their pockets, compared with just 41% in 2015. Today, nearly 90% of high schoolers and over 50% of 11-year-olds are smartphone owners as well.﻿﻿
 
As we all know, if you have a smartphone (or any other electronic device), you also have the potential for 24-hour access to television and other content via streaming. While overuse is all too common, the relative ability or inability to self-regulate viewing time and choosing screentime to the exclusion of other activities is a key indicator of a problem.﻿﻿
 
Common Sense Media research found that tweens and teens spend the majority of their screentime binge-watching TV and videos, with YouTube and Netflix topping the most used content providers. After TV, the most frequent electronic activities among teens are gaming and social media.﻿﻿
 According to 2019 Common Sense Media data, teens spend 39% of their over 7 daily screentime hours watching TV and videos, 22% devoted to gaming, and 16% to social media. This adds up to over 5.5 hours total and nearly 3 hours a day watching content. Tweens, who average just under 5 hours of daily screen time, allot 53% of their media time to TV and videos, 31% to gaming, and 4% to social media. 
When TV addiction was first studied in the 1970s, it was described as paralleling five of the seven DSM criteria used for diagnosing substance dependence.﻿﻿ People who were ""addicted"" to television spent large amounts of their time watching it; they watched TV longer or more often than they intended; they made repeated unsuccessful efforts to cut down their TV watching; they withdrew from or gave up important social, family, or occupational activities in order to watch television; and they reported ""withdrawal""-like symptoms of subjective discomfort when deprived of TV.﻿﻿
 
Studies conducted with self-identified ""TV addicts"" have shown that those who consider themselves addicted to television are more generally unhappy, anxious, and withdrawn than other people who watch television. These people use television watching to distract themselves from negative moods, worries and fears, and boredom.﻿﻿ They are also somewhat more likely to be solitary and hostile and to withdraw from or have difficulty maintaining social connections with others, although it is unclear whether there is a causal link between these personality characteristics and addiction.
 
More recently, research shows there is a growing popular trend toward binge-watching television in our culture, which may be exacerbating television addiction.﻿﻿ Characteristics that have been associated with self-identified TV addiction are binge-watching, susceptibility to boredom, and the use of TV to fill time. The TV (whether streaming on a device or watching on a traditional TV) is used as a way to avoid rather than seek out stimulation. In addition, people who become addicted to TV tend to have poor attention and self-control, feel guilty about wasting time, and are prone to daydreams involving fear of failure.﻿﻿
 
One reason TV or screen addiction isn't considered a true addiction is a lack of sufficient research and the fact that many symptoms of overuse have been normalized. Most of us partake in some of these behaviors to some degree, from spending a weekend binge-watching our favorite show to winding down with a few hours on Facebook, YouTube, or game consoles.﻿﻿ Everywhere we look people are staring at screens and, if not, are holding them in their hands, pockets, or bags.
 
However, while the research data hasn't caught up quite yet to our rapidly changing media and screen landscape, it will soon. Many studies are now in the works that should shed light on the impact all this screentime is having and whether obsessive behaviors around TV watching, social media, gaming, and/or any other electronically-based activity should be classified as true addictions. Regardless, there is a vast agreement that chronic TV watching and screen overuse is a problem.﻿﻿
 
One pertinent study is the National Institute on Drug Abuse's ongoing, large scale Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD Study) project. The ABCD Study, which began in 2016, is following nearly 12,000 youth over 10 years to determine the effects of screentime on brain development, among other social and environmental factors.﻿﻿
 
The one electronic activity addiction that has gained official legitimacy is gaming addiction, which was listed as a potential disorder in need of further research in the DSM-5.﻿﻿
 
Alarmingly, rates of many mental health concerns, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to suicide,﻿﻿ are also on the rise—and some wonder if this may be, in part, related to skyrocketing screentime. In fact, a 2018 study in Pediatrics, found a link between screentime, quantity of sleep, and impulsivity-related disorders.﻿﻿ These findings echo what many parents and experts see as a link between screens and the exacerbation of ADHD symptoms and other behavioral and mental health issues in children.
 
Research has also revealed disturbing evidence that excessive TV watching is associated with a shorter lifespan.﻿﻿ Those in the highest risk category watched an average of six hours of television a day and had a lifespan nearly five years shorter than people who did not watch TV. But does TV itself cause a shorter lifespan? Perhaps not. The study’s authors have stated that the results may be caused by other factors strongly associated with excessive TV watching such as overeating, lack of exercise, and depression.﻿﻿
 
Indeed, there are multiple addictive behaviors that lend themselves to hours of TV watching. Marijuana addiction and heroin addiction both tend to lead to hours of inactivity, often in front of screens.﻿﻿ People with chronic pain who are reliant on painkillers are often limited in their mobility so they can’t get out and about. And while the focus of research into shopping addiction tends to be retail stores and online shopping, it may neglect one of the most compulsive scenarios for the shopaholic—the shopping channel.﻿﻿
 
Television may be addictive, along with other forms of media, such as video game addiction, internet addiction, cybersex, and smartphone addiction. Still, it seems likely that it co-exists with many other addictions that feed off the isolation that is felt by people with numerous other behavioral and substance addictions.﻿﻿
 
So, what can we do to offset the danger of too much TV and electronic device usage? Whether or not TV or screen overuse is technically an addiction, we can take steps to reduce its effects. Many parents have intuitively recognized the need to monitor and manage their kids' screen time, long before the rise of the internet—and getting back to the time before the internet can be key to shaking its allure.
 
Experts suggest the most effective methods for countering screen overuse are removing access to devices, logging use to build awareness and accountability, utilizing screentime apps that will track and limit access, and replacing electronic leisure time with old school activities, such as board games, exercise, and family (device-free) meals.﻿﻿ Parents can also model good screentime self-control by limiting their own use. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also help for those who feel they need more intensive help.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
While we await more concrete data on TV and screen overuse to emerge from ongoing research studies, what is certain is that screentime is on the rise and there is increasing concern over ""addictive"" screen behaviors in both children and adults. Many parents worry that their children are guinea pigs as the impacts of this untested influx of high tech gadgets, social media, and pervasive screens play out in real-time before research on possible detrimental effects can be fully vetted.
 
Luckily, screens don't have to take over and control our lives. While it is certainly a challenge, we have the tools to reduce screentime in our lives simply by limiting access, building awareness, and swapping virtual actives for ones done in the real world.

Food addiction is not currently recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, 4th edition), and there is no agreement among experts on whether it should be included in future editions. That is, a doctor can't make an official diagnosis of food addiction.
 
However, the DSM does make provision for the diagnosis of out-of-control eating -- considered the hallmark of food addiction by those who subscribe to the idea -- under the category of eating disorder NOS, ""binge eating disorder."" Binge eating disorder has been proposed as a new stand-alone disorder in the fifth edition of the DSM.
 
Binge eating is also a symptom of bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder that involves excessive eating.
 The main difference between binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa is the obsession with being thin and the effort made by people with bulimia to ""purge"" the food they eat from their bodies through inducing vomiting or diarrhea, or through excessive exercise. 
The health problems caused by obesity are well recognized, and great efforts are being made to educate the community on the need for a healthy diet and regular exercise. However, whether the addictive nature of eating will be embraced by the medical profession remains more elusive.
 
Food addiction is only an addiction if it is problematic or harmful in some way. It is not a label that can simply be applied to anyone who enjoys or eats a lot of food, or who binges occasionally.
 
While ""food addiction"" is not officially recognized, there are several treatments that help, and there is a wealth of commercial organizations and self-help resources that provide help with getting control over your eating (such as Overeaters Anonymous). However, the so-called ""diet industry"" has been criticized for exploiting people who are victims of social and cultural pressures to be thin, and even for making the problem worse.
 
Eating disorders programs vary in whether they treat over-eating, as most are geared towards helping people with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Different approaches may be taken to treatment, and some eating disorders program follow the Stages of Change model, which is widely use in addictions treatment. However, if you believe you have a problem with over-eating, your doctor and mainstream psychological services will be able to offer a lot of help and support in overcoming your problem.
 
While ""food addiction"" is not an official diagnosis, the problems associated with over-eating are well recognized in the medical and psychiatric community. If you are worried that over-eating is disrupting your life, you can and should seek out professional help.

Despite culture’s flippant treatment of the term “pyromaniac”— often jokingly shortened to “pyro” or termed “firebug”— people with pyromania have a serious mental health condition.﻿﻿
 
Pyromania is characterized by intentionally and repetitively setting fires — and doing so compulsively. Pyromaniacs feel unable to stop the behavior. Setting a fire releases inner tension or anxiety and gives the person a rush of pleasure or relief.
 
The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) files pyromania in the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders section.﻿﻿ The essential feature of pyromania is the presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and purposeful fire setting.
 
In addition, individuals with pyromania experience tension and affective arousal before setting a fire. Other symptoms may include:
 
People with pyromania do not set fires for monetary gain. They also aren’t trying to conceal criminal activity, gain vengeance, or improve their living situation. The symptoms also cannot be in response to delusions or hallucinations.
 
The fire setting also cannot stem from impaired judgment, such as an intellectual disability. The diagnosis also won’t be made if the behavior is better explained by another mental illness, such as conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder or if it occurs during a manic episode.
 
People with pyromania may make considerable advance preparation for setting fires. They may be indifferent to whether anyone is physically or financially harmed or they may gain pleasure from the destruction they cause.
 
A pyromaniac might hoard matches and lighters, burn holes in fabric, rugs, or furniture and set fire to pieces of paper or other flammable materials. They may seem obsessed with setting fires.
 
But, pyromaniacs don’t have a desire to harm anyone and they aren’t looking for monetary gains from the fires they set.
 
So while an arsonist may burn down someone’s house to get revenge or to try and collect insurance money, pyromaniacs are doing it purely for the emotional benefits they gain from starting fires.  
 
There isn't a single known cause of pyromania. Research suggests there might be a genetic link and it may be similar to a behavioral addiction.﻿﻿
 
It’s not known exactly how many people have pyromania. Researchers estimate it only affects a very small portion of the population, however.
 
The lifetime prevalence of fire setting is reported to be 1.1% of the population—and that’s only one component of pyromania.﻿﻿ So it’s likely there are far fewer people who meet the full criteria for a diagnosis.
 
When researchers examined individuals in the criminal system who had exhibited repeat fire-setting behaviors, they found only 3.3% of that population met the full criteria for pyromania.﻿﻿
 
People who have certain other mental illnesses may be at a higher risk than the general population. People with a gambling disorder, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, and antisocial personality disorder may be more likely to be pyromaniacs.﻿﻿
 
The condition appears in both males and females—though it’s significantly more common in males—and people of any age, even as young as 3 years old. 
 
It’s more common in people who have learning disabilities or lack social skills, and there are environmental factors in play, too.
 
Pyromania has been associated with people who have been sexually or physically abused, or suffer parental neglect or abandonment. People who have a history of crime also tend to display more fire-setting tendencies.
 
For example, more than 19% of those diagnosed with pyromania has been charged with vandalism at least once, and around 18% have been found guilty of non-violent sexual offenses.﻿﻿
 
Fire setting is a major problem in young people.﻿﻿ But, few of those young people meet the criteria for pyromania.
 
There isn’t a typical age of onset for pyromania. It may be identified during childhood but it’s not clear if pyromania lasts into adulthood.
 
Fire-setting behaviors often come and go in people with pyromania. So a child who exhibits symptoms of pyromania may seem to get better over time before engaging in fire setting again.
 
Pyromania may be identified during childhood. Family, friends, or teachers may be among the first people to recognize a child seems obsessed with fire.
 
Fire setting in adolescents is often associated with conduct disorder, ADHD, or an adjustment disorder.﻿﻿
 
Immediate treatment of suspected pyromania is key to avoid the risk of injury, property damage, jail time or even death. The sole method of treatment for pyromania is cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches a person to acknowledge the feelings of tension that can lead to setting fires and finding a safer way to release that tension.﻿﻿
 
Family members who are concerned about an individual who seems obsessed with fire might benefit from family counseling. Family therapy can help loved ones understand the disorder while also teaching them how to keep the family safe.
 
At this point, there haven’t been any controlled trials of medication for pyromania, though proposed medical treatments include the use of SSRIs, antiepileptic medications, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and anti-androgens. Therefore, cognitive behavioral therapy is considered the only viable treatment option at this time.
 
Pyromania isn’t a joking matter, nor is it something to treat lightly. Potential pyromaniacs should seek help immediately to keep themselves, as well everyone in their lives and in their community, safe from harm or damage.

It's not uncommon for individuals living with an addiction to have problems with boundaries. For the people who love and care about them, establishing and enforcing healthy boundaries can be a challenge. The process can be painful and guilt-inducing. When a person with an addiction is struggling, those closest to them are often willing to allow otherwise problematic behaviors in order to help their loved one find their way. Unfortunately, this often means letting the person ""cross the line"" when it comes to certain completely inappropriate behaviors.
 
Simply put, boundaries are limits to what is acceptable or can be tolerated in a relationship. In the literal sense of the word, a boundary is a dividing line that separates one area from another and one that can be marked by a physical barrier like a fence or a road. Without the physical marker, it may not be clear exactly where one area ends and the other begins. In a similar way, when we use the word boundary to describe limits and rules in relationships, some judgment is needed to decide which behaviors ""cross the line."" Herein lies the difficulty that people living with an addiction and their loved ones have with boundaries in their relationships.
 
Boundaries are very individual, but people with substance addictions and those close to them often have problems with respecting boundaries. Often, areas of difficulty for boundary setting surround the very substances and behaviors at the center of the addiction.
 
Substance abuse and addiction often raise issues of legality that should be addressed with firm boundaries. Common areas where boundaries should be set include:
 
It is never acceptable to implicate another person in illegal activities. Beyond setting boundaries surrounding illegal behaviors, boundaries can and should also be set around issues of safety, health, and even comfort. You define the boundaries in your relationships.
 
Smoking in someone else's presence, around their children, or in their home are common boundaries for nonsmokers. Smoking is known to cause harm even to nonsmokers, and now it's known that not just secondhand smoke but thirdhand smoke is hazardous to health. Personal preference and comfort are also perfectly legitimate rationale for strict boundaries.
 People with a nicotine addiction may have difficulties with adhering to strict boundaries around their smoking behaviors. 
When deciding on your boundaries when it comes to smoking, remember that It is completely justified if you feel it should always be off-limits in your presence.
 
Setting limits on just how much alcohol consumption is acceptable to each person in the relationship is tricky and attempting to control what and how much can be consumed can lead to struggle. In the case where the person with an alcohol or drug addiction may not feel or admit that they have a problem, requesting limits can be both futile and frustrating. It can be embarrassing to be in the company of the person with addiction when they are unable and unwilling to communicate in a meaningful way because they are under the influence.
 
Where drinking and drug use are concerned, you must decide what kinds of behavior are acceptable in your home. Then you must clearly communicate your expectations.
 
The first step is to set your boundary; the next step is to enforce it. Define and discuss what is acceptable before the communication efforts become stalled or potentially veer into verbal or emotional abuse. Use ""I"" statements to express your boundaries directly, honestly, and respectfully. Then, be prepared to clearly state when you feel that the line is being crossed and even to remove yourself from the situation if your boundaries aren't respected. Enforcing your boundaries may require enforcing consequences for behavior that violates the boundary.

Many people with alcohol use disorders also have sleep problems. They may fall asleep easily, but excessive alcohol use disrupts their sleep during the latter part of the night.
 
If you drink to excess, even occasionally, you have probably experienced sleep problems. ""Three or more drinks will cause the average person to fall asleep sooner than usual,"" says Shawn R. Currie of the University of Calgary. ""However, falling asleep faster is the only real benefit of alcohol for sleep."" If you quit drinking and remain sober, you can have significant sleep problems long after you stop drinking.
 Most heavy drinkers who quit drinking find it difficult to sleep during the early days of sobriety; it is one of the most common alcohol withdrawal symptoms and one that causes many to relapse. 
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 25% to 72% of people with alcohol use disorders report sleep troubles. The more prevalent, disruptive effects include more frequent awakenings, worse sleep quality, reduction of deep sleep, and earlier-than-usual waking times, leading people to feel they did not get enough sleep.﻿﻿
 
Studies have found that:
 
Research also shows that sleep disruption can last long after alcohol withdrawal symptoms cease. They may continue to occur in the two to six months of abstinence following withdrawal. Currie notes that recovery and abstinence are more challenging if you aren't able to get enough good-quality sleep.﻿﻿
 
People in alcohol recovery take a long time to fall asleep, have problems sleeping through the night, and feel that their sleep is not restorative.﻿﻿
 Lab studies show reductions in deep sleep and abnormalities in REM sleep in persons with more than a year of sobriety. REM sleep is characterized by increased brain activity, relaxation of the body, rapid eye movements, and increased dreaming. 
""Sleep has a reputation among the recovering community of being one of the last things that fall back into place for an individual,"" says David Hodgins, professor of psychology at the University of Calgary. ""It's also recognized as a potential precipitant of relapse.
 
Within the 12-step community, there's a little saying that describes the risk factors for relapse; it's called HALT. People who are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired are at an increased risk of relapse. Certainly, one way a person can be tired is through sleep disruptions.""
 
Researchers found that alcoholics with both short- and long-term abstinence had similarly disturbed sleep after they quit drinking. In general, problems with sleep onset were worse than with sleep maintenance.﻿﻿
 
Many people experiencing insomnia in recovery also had insomnia before they became dependent on alcohol. Currie notes that chronic insomnia affects 10% to 15% of the general adult population, but half of his study participants had insomnia before they became alcohol dependent. ""Although we cannot infer any causal connection between insomnia and alcoholism from this data, it is hard to ignore such a high rate of pre-existing sleep problems in the sample,"" he says.﻿﻿
 
The first treatment for insomnia in recovery is sobriety, and many patients will see improvement. For the specific treatment of insomnia, behavioral therapies are the preferred treatment (rather than medications), as they have been shown to be effective and they won't interfere with sobriety.﻿﻿
 
The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is to change sleep habits as well as any misconceptions about sleep and insomnia that may perpetuate sleep difficulties. CBT-I often entails regular, weekly meetings, during which your therapist will give you sleep assessments, work with you to alter problematic sleep behaviors, and ask you to complete a sleep diary at home.
 
This type of behavioral therapy works to improve your sleep efficiency, or the time you spend asleep divided by the time you spend in bed. The idea behind sleep restriction is that by limiting the amount of time you allow yourself to sleep and stay in bed, you'll increase your desire to sleep (called sleep drive) and sleep less fitfully and more efficiently.
 
There are many medications used to treat insomnia, including benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine medications. If you're in recovery, your healthcare provider will need to weigh the risks and benefits of prescribing these medications for insomnia. There are also some relapse prevention medications that can help promote sleep.﻿﻿
 
Numerous complementary therapies have been used to treat insomnia in people in recovery, including:
 
Working on your sleep hygiene is another way to help prevent or reduce insomnia. These are changes you can make to your environment and routine to help promote sleep.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Sleep problems can last for many months after quitting drinking.﻿﻿ Recovering alcoholics typically have more problems with sleep onset than with sleep maintenance.﻿﻿ Many recovering alcoholics had sleep problems that predate their alcohol dependence.﻿﻿ Onset insomnia: Trouble falling asleep Maintenance insomnia: Inability to sleep through the night (wake up and can't fall back to sleep) Acute insomnia: Brief period of trouble sleeping, often caused by a stressful life event or experience Chronic insomnia: Problems falling or staying sleeping at least three nights per week for three months or longer Comorbid insomnia: Occurs with another condition, like depression or anxiety, that also interferes with sleep Relaxation and biofeedback therapy Progressive muscle relaxation Yoga Aromatherapy Mindfulness meditation Develop a relaxing bedtime routine. Whether you write in a journal, use a meditation app, or wind down with a warm bath, doing something calming prior to lights out will help set the tone for solid slumber. Keep your room dark, cool, and comfortable. Avoid the use of television, cell phones, computers, or e-readers in your bedroom. The blue light from these electronic devices can suppress the body's sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and interfere with your internal body clock. The National Sleep Foundation recommends keeping your room cool (around 65 degrees Fahrenheit) and using light-blocking curtains, shades, or blinds to keep your bedroom dark.﻿﻿ Keep a regular sleep/wake schedule. This will enable your body to get used to a certain bedtime and then be ready to sleep at that time. Avoid napping. Naps decrease your overall amount of sleep debt, making it more difficult to fall asleep again at night at the proper time.  Refrain from stimulants in the evening. Stimulants that disrupt sleep include caffeine (coffee, tea, soft drinks, chocolate) and nicotine. According to a study published in Psychology, Health & Medicine, the average person loses more than one minute of sleep for every cigarette they smoke.﻿﻿",many people alcohol use disorder also sleep

Times have changed. In the 1970s, 1980s, and even the 1990s, it was not uncommon for parents of young children to smoke and drink alcohol around them. While a few still do, many younger parents choose not to drink or smoke at all, and rightly so. Recognition of the health harms of secondhand smoke on babies and children and awareness of the impact of role modeling on future behavior discourages younger parents from drinking and smoking around their children.
 
But for grandparents who smoked throughout their adult lives, and are now in their 60s, 70s, or older, many feel they do not need to quit.
 Many people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol underestimate how much they consume, and do not believe their behavior or their alcohol consumption is problematic. 
Some believe the risks of smoking and drinking are exaggerated, as they think because they have not been diagnosed with a serious illness, that they are in good health.
 
Hard though it is to understand, even some of those who have been diagnosed with serious illnesses, including conditions directly related to smoking and drinking, refuse to change their behavior concerning these substances. Yet it can be difficult for younger parents to confront their own parents, or even ask them not to drink or smoke around their grandchildren, for fear of offending or angering their parents.
 
Setting boundaries with parents are difficult for the adult children of people with all kinds of addictions.
 
The roles are reversed when you set boundaries around your parents' behavior. Setting boundaries around parents smoking are particularly difficult, because smokers cling to their ""right"" to smoke while exposing your child to increased risks of smoking themselves, and of the health risks of secondhand and third-hand smoke.
 
Alcohol can be even more problematic if your parent drinks and becomes intoxicated around your child or children. While past generations may have ""laughed it off,"" parents are now more knowledgeable about the impact of drinking on youngsters. Not only may it encourage them to think of drinking as normal and harmless if grandma or grandpa does it, but drunkenness can lead to inappropriate language or behavior, which can lead to a range of outcomes, from embarrassment to abuse.
 
Making excuses for your parents rarely works. Kids can sense their parents' discomfort, and it can be difficult to explain away your parents' behavior to your children, or even to answer their questions about their grandparents' behavior in a way that feels honest and informative. Allowing these behaviors to continue can lead to rifts in the family which, ultimately, could impact your feelings about your children spending time with their grandparents at all.
 
As an adult child, you are no longer obliged to follow your parents' instructions or to tolerate their unacceptable behavior. As a parent, you have a responsibility to protect your own children from the harmful effects of smoke and seeing an influential adult, their grandparent, smoking, or drinking alcohol. Therefore, you must set boundaries with your parents smoking in order to protect your child.
 
Before you assert yourself with your parents, It is helpful to get clear on exactly what you find unacceptable, the reasons for this, and what you would like your parents to do instead.
 
There is a big difference between your parent absentmindedly lighting up in front of the grandchildren, or drinking alcohol early in the day, and becoming intoxicated and violent. If either of your parents becomes aggressive, violent or verbally abusive to you or your children, you should withdraw your children from spending any time with them until their behavior changes, or your child becomes an adult.
 You are neglecting to protect your child if you allow them to be with someone abusive, even if you love that person and believe they should spend time together. 
Similarly, you should not allow your children to spend time with a grandparent who uses illicit drugs. Doing so exposes your child to the modeling of drug using behavior, making it more likely your child will use drugs him or herself. Children can also be harmed by accidentally or experimentally using drugs themselves, which they may be able to do if they are in an environment where drugs are taken. They can also be hurt or infected by paraphernalia such as lighters and needles.
 
You may find that your parent is more respectful of your boundaries in your home than in their own home or in some public places more than others. Choose your meeting locations accordingly, and don't give in to pressure from your parent to come to them, only to have them smoke around you and your child because it is ""my house, my rules.""
 
You may also be able to avoid a confrontation with your parent by selecting places for your children to spend time with your parents, where it will not be easy or even possible for your parents to smoke, drink, or use drugs. There are many public venues which provide entertainment and activities suitable for families, which do not allow smoking or public intoxication, such as shopping malls, libraries, playgrounds, restaurants, and movie theaters. The great advantage of choosing these locations, and meeting your parents right inside, rather than outside the building, is that the enforcement aspect will be taken care of by someone other than you.
 You can also involve your child in deciding where they are going to meet their grandparents, by giving them two or more options of safe locations, from which they can choose. 
That way, when you communicate the location of choice, you can explain to your parent that the activity was something your child has specifically asked to do with their grandparent. This can be an effective way of keeping your child away from your parents' bad influence, while at the same time, encouraging them to develop a close relationship.
 
When setting boundaries with your parent, start with the most gentle boundary setting, and work up to more assertive and rigid boundaries only if your initial efforts fail.
 
First attempt: Ask your parent not to smoke or drink in front of your child (or in front of you if it bothers you). If your first attempt is successful, and your parent does not smoke or drink in front of you or your child, you don't need to set any further boundaries.
 
Second attempt: If your parent smokes or drinks in front of your child, remind them of your previous request, and say that if they insist on smoking or drinking, you will take your child away from their presence. If you think your parent will react in an explosive manner, you might choose to do this away from your child, so that you don't upset your child, or open yourself up to manipulations from your parent (such as, ""Look, you are upsetting the children!"").
 
Follow up with a frank discussion with your parent, perhaps on the phone, about how important it is to avoid exposing your child to secondhand smoke, or to alcohol, and suggest trying to work out an agreement whereby they can refrain from smoking or drinking during a specified period of time, or in a situation that will allow your parent to take a ""smoke break"" away from your child. But remember, third-hand smoke—which refers to the particles and gases that are left over after a cigarette is extinguished and remain on virtually any surface in an area where someone has smoked—also carries risks to your child.
 
Final attempt: If your parent continues to smoke or drink in front of your child, or engages in manipulations to pressurize you into tolerating them smoking or drinking, I would suggest you limit physical contact between your parent and your child. This might seem harsh and may be distressing for both of them, but it sends a clear message about the importance of this issue.
 
What it boils down to is how much your parent values time with their grandchild—if they care about spending time with your child, they will quit or at least restrain their smoking. In spite of what your parent may say, they are fully capable of functioning without smoking or drinking, even if it is for a brief period of time, such as an hour or two, which is typically as long as most young children will want to be engaging in an activity.
 
If your parent is very heavily addicted to nicotine, they can use nicotine replacement during the time they are with your children, such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch. And if they are unable to function for a short period during the day without alcohol, it is likely that they have a very serious problem with alcohol.
 
It can be hard to stand up to your parents. You don't want to embarrass them, nor do you want to provoke an argument, particularly one you can't win. However, it is worth persevering to find a way to bring your parents and children together for the sake of their relationship, without exposing your children to their harmful influence.

People who have been successful in overcoming their dependence on alcohol and other drugs usually refer to their new lifestyle as being in ""recovery."" But addiction experts agree there is more to recovery than just being sober.
 
While there's no standard definition of ""recovery"" in the addiction community, several organizations have come up with working definitions to help better understand and measure recovery efforts.
 A standard definition of recovery includes ensuring that vital recovery supports and services are available and accessible to all who need and want them.  
Part of the reason why it's so tricky to define recovery is that everyone's recovery journey is unique.
 
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Commission (SAMHSA) and a variety of partners in the behavioral health care community collaborated to define recovery in a way that would capture shared experiences of those recovering from both mental disorders and substance use disorders.
 
According to SAMHSA, recovery is ""a process of change through which people improve their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential.""﻿﻿
 
SAHMSA also defined four major dimensions that support recovery, including:
 
Prior to this, the Betty Ford Institute created the following working definition of recovery: ""A voluntarily maintained lifestyle characterized by sobriety, personal health, and citizenship.""﻿﻿
 
""Recovery may be the best word to summarize all the positive benefits to physical, mental, and social health that can happen when alcohol- and other drug-dependent individuals get the help they need,"" the expert panel wrote in a 2007 paper published in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment.﻿﻿
 
In this definition, personal health refers not only to physical and mental health but also to social health—participation in family and social roles. Citizenship refers to ""giving back"" to the community and society.
 
Along with a working definition, SAMHSA defined 10 guiding principles that support the recovery definition.
 
Sobriety—defined as complete abstinence from alcohol and all other non-prescribed drugs—is a necessary part of recovery but it's often just the first step. In fact, experts agree there are several stages of recovery, although like the definition of recovery, there is not a universal agreement on the stages of recovery.
 
Many people are able to quit or cut back on drinking and feel that this is all it takes to achieve recovery. Experts believe, however, that being in recovery from an alcohol use disorder (or any other type of substance use disorder) is not just about remaining sober, but building a better life without alcohol.
 In recovery, you take all the tools and skills you have learned during your addiction treatment to become a healthier person, a better spouse and parent, a productive member of society, and a good neighbor and citizen. 
According to SAMHSA, there are some key signs that let individuals know they are in active recovery:
 
Once you are in recovery, some experts believe that there are certain ""rules"" that can help ensure that you don't relapse.﻿﻿

Health: Overcoming or managing one’s disease(s) or symptoms and making informed, healthy choices that support physical and emotional well-being Home: Having a stable and safe place to live Purpose: Conducting meaningful daily activities and having the independence, income, and resources to participate in society Community: Having relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope Recovery emerges from hope. Recovery is person-driven. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Recovery is holistic. Recovery is supported by peers and allies. Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks. Recovery is culturally-based and influenced. Recovery is supported by addressing trauma. Recovery involves individual, family, and community strengths and responsibility. Recovery is based on respect. The Betty Ford Institute Consensus Panel: Early (one to 12 months of abstinence), sustained (one to five years of abstinence), stable (more than five years of sobriety)﻿﻿ The National Institute on Drug Abuse: Early abstinence, maintaining abstinence, and advanced recovery The Developmental Model: Transition, stabilization, early, middle recovery, late recovery and maintenance﻿﻿ You can address problems as they happen, without getting stressed out and without relapsing. You have at least one person with whom you can be completely honest. You know which issues are yours and which ones belong to other people, and you have personal boundaries. You take the time to restore your energy—physical and emotional—when you're tired. Change your life: The idea is that recovery revolves around creating a new life for yourself—one in which you create new healthy relationships, find sober fun, and explore ways to manage life stressors without alcohol or drugs. Be completely honest: Living with an alcohol use disorder may have meant lying—to yourself and your loved ones about your alcohol misuse. In recovery, honesty can help people learn to trust themselves again and to deal with past lies. Ask for help: While you won't want to hang around with your old drinking pals in a bar, isolation is not the answer. In fact, studies have found that joining a self-help group can increase your chances of long-term recovery.

You've recognized you have a problem—that your addictive behavior is affecting other parts of your life—and you want to know how to quit an addiction. The chances are that you didn't expect to become addicted when you started. You may have thought you were just having fun and could quit at any time.
 
Many people who develop addictions are surprised at how difficult they find their first attempt at quitting, and end up wondering, Why can't I quit?
 
The good news is that you can quit, although it is a complicated process. There are many factors, physical, mental, and emotional, that make quitting difficult.﻿﻿ This is why so many people find treatment helps to guide them through the complex process of quitting – although many people are successful quitting on their own.
 
Understanding why quitting is so difficult can help you see that everyone overcoming an addiction goes through the same process to some extent. It is not that you are especially weak-willed or that you are failing any more than anyone else.
 
When you find yourself thinking, feeling, or acting in a particular way that goes against your decision to quit, you can be more compassionate with yourself, and keep trying.
 
Tolerance and withdrawal are key factors that contribute to addiction. They are strongly interconnected and are the main processes that got you addicted in the first place.﻿﻿ If people didn't develop tolerance and withdrawal, they would probably find it a lot easier to quit.
 
Tolerance is a physical and psychological process. When you experience an addictive substance or behavior the first time, it may be overwhelming, unpleasant even, or it may be mild and pleasurable. If the effect feels strong, you may feel there is no danger of you wanting to overdo it. If it is mild, it may seem harmless and innocent.
 
The more times the behavior is repeated, the less sensitivity you have to it, and the more you need to get the same effect. Drugs, such as alcohol and opiates, work on specific parts of the brain, creating physical tolerance.
 
Behaviors, such as sex and gambling, produce feelings of excitement that get less intense over time.﻿﻿ As tolerance develops, you may want to do more of the drug or behavior to get the same effect.
 
As you become addicted, you may experience withdrawal when you aren't able to do the addictive behavior. Physical withdrawal symptoms may occur, such as shaking, feeling unwell, stomach upsets, and/or psychological withdrawal symptoms, such as feeling anxious and depressed. These are easily fixed by more of the addictive substance or behavior.
 
Physical withdrawal from alcohol and drugs although variable and often resolves over a period of several days. However, it tends to be quite unpleasant and it can be dangerous. If you decide to quit, it is best done under medical supervision.﻿﻿
 
Discuss physical withdrawal with your doctor for the best way to approach this. Once you have been through withdrawal, there are deeper psychological processes that make it difficult to stay ""on the wagon.""
 
When your addictive behavior becomes excessive to the point of creating conflict, it is out of balance with other parts of your life. Conflict may occur within yourself – you want to rein in your behavior while, at the same time, have greater urges to do it. Conflicts also occur with other people: whether they want you to quit or want you to join them in the addictive behavior.
 
Despite making a commitment to quit, and going through the withdrawal phase, conflicts do not simply go away. Expectations are higher than ever before. The one thing you depended on to cope with stress—the addictive behavior—is now off-limits.
 
This is why it is so important to have other ways of coping firmly established, ideally before quitting. A therapist will help you with this. Without coping strategies in place, you are likely to experience strong urges to go back to the addictive behavior ""one more time."" Relationship support can help you deal with and avoid conflicts without using your addictive behavior for comfort and escape.
 
Ambivalence, the mixed feelings of both wanting to continue with the addictive behavior and wanting to quit, is part of the addictive process even in the early stages of experimentation.﻿﻿ Often, this is felt in terms of ""right"" and ""wrong,"" a moral dilemma, especially in relation to sexual and illegal behaviors. In some cases, guilt feelings are appropriate; in others, they are not.
 
The discomfort of these feelings of guilt when your behavior doesn't fit with your own standards of right and wrong can be a strong motivator to make changes. Sometimes it can work against you, causing you to justify your behavior to yourself and other people. This can get in the way of the decision to quit.﻿﻿
 
Some common justifications are:
 
Therapy can help you to cope with uncomfortable feelings and help you unravel the irrational thoughts that keep you addicted. Quitting is not easy or straightforward, but a good treatment program will help you achieve it when you are ready.

Motivational Interviewing is a therapeutic technique for helping people make changes in their lives, which has been applied effectively to the treatment of addictions.
 
The spirit of Motivational Interviewing is based on three key concepts: collaboration between the therapist and the person with the addiction, rather than confrontation by the therapist; drawing out the individual's ideas, rather the therapist imposing their ideas; and autonomy of the person with the addiction, rather than the therapist having authority over them.
 
Collaboration is the partnership that is formed between the therapist and the person with the addiction. This partnership is based on the point of view and experiences of the person with the addiction.
 
This contrasts with some other approaches to addictions treatment, which are based on the therapist confronting the person with the addiction, and imposing their point of view about the person's addictive behavior.
 Collaboration has the effect of building rapport between the therapist and the person with the addiction and allows the person with the addiction to develop trust towards the therapist, which can be difficult in a confrontational atmosphere. 
This does not mean that the therapist automatically agrees with the person with the addiction. Although the person with the addiction and their therapist may see things differently, the therapeutic process is focused on mutual understanding, not the therapist being right and the person with the addiction being wrong.
 
The approach of the therapist drawing out the individual's own ideas, rather than the therapist imposing their opinions is based on the belief that the motivation, or wish, to change comes from the person with the addiction, not from the therapist. No matter how much the therapist might want the person to change their behavior, it will only happen if that individual also wants to change their behavior. So it is the therapist's job to ""draw out"" the person's true motivations and skills for change, not to tell the person with the addiction what to do.
 
Unlike some other treatment models that emphasize the doctor or the therapist as an authority figure, Motivational Interviewing recognizes that the true power for making changes rests within the person with the addiction, not within the therapist. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to follow through with making changes happen. This is empowering to the individual, but also gives them responsibility for their actions.
 
Four guiding principles form the basis of the Motivational Interviewing approach. Although each person's process of overcoming an addiction will be different, the therapist will hold true to these principles throughout each individual's process. These principles are vital to establishing trust within the therapeutic relationship.
 
People with addictions are often reluctant to go into treatment because they don't believe that the therapist, who, after all, is working to end people's addictions, will understand why the addictive behavior means so much to them. Many, especially those who have put up with other people criticizing their behavior, believe they will be judged, some even feeling guilty about their behavior and feeling judgment would be valid. But judgment simply is not what Motivational Interviewing is about.
 
Instead of judging the person with the addiction, the therapist focuses on understanding the situation from the addicted person's point of view. This is known as ""empathy."" Empathy does not mean that the therapist agrees with the person, but that they understand and that the individual's behavior makes sense to them (or did at the time the behavior was carried out). This creates an atmosphere of acceptance.
 
Motivational Interviewing recognizes that people with addictions are usually ambivalent and uncertain about whether or not they want to change. Their addiction has probably already had consequences for them, which have brought them into treatment. Yet they have developed their addiction as a way of coping with life, and they do not necessarily like the idea of giving that up.​​
 
Motivational Interviewing helps people to make up their minds about how to move forward through the stages of change, by helping the individual to look at the advantages and disadvantages of different choices and actions. So without pressuring the person, goals and actions can be developed in this trusting, collaborative atmosphere, which is based on the individual's own needs, wishes, goals, values, and strengths.
 
Motivational Interviewing as an approach recognizes that change does not always happen easily or just because the individual wants it. It is natural for the person to change their mind many times about whether they want to give up their addiction, and what that process, and their new lifestyle, will look like.
 
Rather than challenging, opposing or criticizing the person with the addiction, the therapist will help the individual to reach a new understanding of themselves and what their addiction means to them. They do this by re-framing and offering different interpretations of situations that come up in the change process, typically which increase the person's motivation to change. All of this is based on the individual's own goals and values, which have already been explored.
 
The therapist will always support the person's belief in their own power to make the changes they want. In the beginning, the therapist may have more confidence in the individual that they have themselves, but this changes with ongoing support.

Having any member of your family in rehab for drugs or alcohol means that you're inevitably facing and perhaps even struggling with a lot of concerns, questions and maybe some misconceptions about how professional treatment works.
 
The following may answer some of those questions.
 
First, relax and take a deep breath. Your family member is not being held against his will, and he is not locked up. Apparently, he had a substance abuse problem and has decided to get professional help. If that is the case, he is exactly where he needs to be to get the help that he needs.
 
He is in the hands of a staff of professionals, including medical and nursing personnel, who have received specialized training and education to help people who have alcohol or drug problems. He is also surrounded by peers who are or have been in the same situation that your family member is in and will provide an additional support system for him while he begins recovery.
 
He will receive group therapy, individual counseling, medical care, and a balanced diet. In other words, your loved one is in the hands of exactly who he needs, to get the help he needs to address his substance abuse issues.
 
Your family member is in a medical facility. Due to confidentiality concerns and federal privacy laws, the staff of the facility is prohibited from giving you any information about his situation. Your loved one will have to tell you himself.
 
No, you cannot talk with him right now, but don't take it personally. In the early days of his rehab program, his contact with the outside world will be highly restricted. He won't be reading newspapers, listening to the radio or watching television, either.
 
This is necessary so that he can concentrate on getting and staying sober with as few distractions or outside influences as possible. In the early hours and days of his treatment, his entire focus needs to be on doing what he needs to do to maintain abstinence.
 
A point will come in your loved one's rehab when you are asked to become involved. Most professional alcohol and drug rehab programs include the family of the patient in his recovery process because research has shown that it reduces the risk of relapse.﻿﻿
 
Usually, during the first month of his rehab, you will be invited to the treatment facility for a ""Family Psychoeducational Workshop,"" or family day. During this time, you will be able to express your concerns, questions, experiences, and feelings related to your addicted family member.
 
Participation in the family workshop is beneficial in several ways:
 
The primary purpose of involving you in the workshop is to provide you with information about the dynamics of alcoholism and addiction, and how family members can be affected by the substance abuse of others. The goal is to lessen the family's burden, increase helpful behaviors, and decrease any unhelpful behaviors.﻿﻿
 
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the following topics are commonly addressed during the family workshop:﻿﻿
 
Although there are many benefits to attending a family educational workshop while your family member is in rehab,﻿﻿ those sessions are not therapy. Many times these workshops will bring out strong feelings among family members, and they can become emotional. But from the treatment center's point of view, these sessions focus on support and education, not therapy.
 
The rehab program's purpose is helping the addicted family member. If you feel that you or other family members have been psychologically or emotionally affected by your loved one's alcoholism or addiction, you will need to seek additional help on your own.
 
You can seek professional marriage counseling, family counseling or individual therapy for yourself. For further support, you can participate in mutual support groups, such as Al-Anon or Naranon, and your children can participate in Alateen. Many family members of alcoholics and addicts have found that joining an Al-Anon Family Group can be a positive, life-changing experience.
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
You can also begin to educate yourself about alcoholism and addiction and how it can affect every member of the family. The more you know about the dynamics of a family affected by addiction, the more you will be able to offer your addicted family member understanding and encouragement.
 It allows the rehab counselors to gain input from the family, observe how the family interacts and learn more about family dynamics. It can encourage your loved one to continue with his treatment program knowing the family supports him. It offers your family member an opportunity to learn how the entire family has been affected by his addiction. An overview of substance abuse and dependence, including prevalence, symptoms, causes, and basic concepts. Effects of substance use disorders on the individual, family system, and individual family members, including children. Overview of recovery issues for the affected person (physical, psychological or emotional, social, family, spiritual and other) and how to measure outcomes. How the family can help, including enabling behaviors for the family to avoid and behaviors that support the addicted family member's recovery. How a family member can heal from the adverse effects of involvement in a close relationship with an alcoholic or addict. Self-help programs for family members and how they can help.

There are many ways to work on self-development and self-improvement, but setting specific goals for personal growth can ensure success. When life serves up obstacles, as it so often does, having a goal that you revisit frequently helps you reset, recommit, and recharge.
 
It also gives you the motivation and accountability to stay focused and follow through on your plans. Setting goals can sometimes feel like a daunting task. That’s why it’s helpful to have a roadmap to guide you along the way. 
 
Like most theories in psychology, goal-setting theory started with the ideas from Dr. Edwin A. Locke, in his article, Toward a Theory of Task Motivation and Incentives. In it, he explained the need for clear and specific goals that are challenging and monitored with regular feedback and progress. 
 
Locke, along with Dr. Gary Latham, came up with five principles of effective goal setting. These principles, which include clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback, and task complexity, are the necessary components when setting, working towards, and achieving a goal. 
 
Additionally, research done by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews points to the correlation between writing down your goals and successes rather than merely formulating and keeping them in your head. 
 
If you’ve ever set a goal and quit before seeing any results, then you know all too well that it takes more than willpower to make a change. Setting and achieving goals says licensed psychologist Catherine Jackson, requires motivation, thinking through the plan, and ways to navigate the possible challenges that may arise. 
 
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), research shows there are three factors to achieving goals:
 
All three of these have a place within SMART goals.
 
When you make your goal specific, you set yourself up for success. Consider answering who, what, where, when, which and why when getting specific about your goal. 
 
What benchmarks will you use to make sure you are moving forward? How will you know if you’re successful? How will you know if you need to make adjustments? Having a goal that you can measure will help you stay on track and reach your target dates. 
 
Is the goal you’re setting one you can reach? While you don’t want things to be easy, you also want to avoid setting goals that are out of your reach. 
 
This goes along with attainable. Is your goal relevant to your life, and can you realistically achieve it, based on your current circumstances? This may be a goal you’ve set before and did not achieve because it was not realistic at the time. But now, under different circumstances, this goal may now be realistic. 
 
For a goal to be realistic it also has to be grounded within a time frame, and it needs to be real or tangible. 
 Developing SMART goals is critical to success. That said, they often limit you to the “what” and the “how” of your goals. For your goals to be effective, you also need to find your purpose or the “why” of what drives your motivation.  
You can set goals in any part of your life. Some of the more common areas include health, career, financial, and education. These broader categories set the stage for the smaller goals you will work on yearly, monthly, and daily. 
 
While some of your goals may land within those categories, it’s important to recognize that self-development goals also encompass things like learning to paint, learning to golf, and giving back to your community. You don’t have to limit yourself to the most obvious parts of your life. 
 
Take some time to think about your passions and interests. Brainstorm some ideas around things that excite you. Think back and try to identify if there’s something you’ve always wanted to do, but fear of the unknown—or fear of failure—prevented you from taking a risk. The ideas you generate from these brainstorming activities are like clues that can help you narrow your focus and set more specific goals. 
 
The next step you’ll want to take is to ask yourself “why” that goal is important to you. For example, if you want to finish your college degree, setting smaller goals that revolve around “why” will help you get there faster. To define your why, consider asking yourself these three questions:
 
Once you have a better idea of your ""why,"" it’s time to do one more self-assessment. Going with the college degree example, if you’ve determined that finishing your degree is the big goal, then, before you apply the SMART strategy to come up with smaller, more obtainable goals, it’s helpful to answer the following questions to determine if you’re truly ready to make this commitment. 
 
Now that you’ve done two different activities to get clear on your reasons, it should be obvious if you’re motivated to create change. If that’s the case, you’re ready to move forward with the goal-setting process. 
 
Setting and working towards a goal requires more than just a piece of paper and pencil. There are also certain skills you need to have in place when taking on a goal. 
 
Fist and foremost, you need to be able to plan out the steps for reaching your goal. And once the plan is in place, it’s the commitment and focus that helps to move you towards the result you want. But, of course, somewhere in the middle, lies self-motivation and flexibility. Here are some other tips and strategies to help you reach your goals. 
 
When setting a goal, try to avoid the temptation to state your desire in a negative way. For example, “I will not complain so much.” Restated positively sounds more like this, “I will find three positive things about my day and write them down before I go to bed.”
 
This is one of the most difficult parts of setting and achieving goals. Because of the very nature of a goal, you start with the end in mind. But it’s really the steps you take to get there that matter the most. Let’s say the outcome you want is to lose 20 pounds. That’s the goal. But during the process of working towards this goal, you discover that your body is more comfortable at a weight that only has you losing 15 pounds. Did you fail at achieving this goal? Not if you believe in the power of the process. 
 
Once you’re ready to go, whether that’s in the preparation or action stage, Jackson recommends making a contract with yourself for success. 
 
Jackson says to get started on the right foot, it’s a good idea to reflect on what you’ve accomplished thus far and forgive yourself and let go of regret for what didn’t come to pass. While working on clearing the clutter from your mind, it’s not a bad idea to do the same with your home and workspaces. 
 
 “Visualization and mental workouts stimulate many of the same neural networks that connect the brain’s intentions to the body, so, take some time to properly train your thoughts before you begin setting your goals,” says Jackson. This helps you purposefully and intentionally imagine your goals coming to fruition.
 
 List out your goal or goals and the steps you need to accomplish them. Then, Jackson says to break these into small attainable steps with realistic deadlines. “This is easier when you set aside time before the start of each week to write out specific things you want to accomplish within the following week that will move you closer to the goal,” she explains. 
 
 It’s a good idea to put your goals with the steps and deadlines in a place where you can see it often. “Seeing the goals and steps you have to take will keep you motivated and consistent to continue to work toward it,” explains Jackson. Her advice? Look at it weekly or better yet daily.
 
As you accomplish steps toward your goal, make sure to reward yourself along the way.
 
One last thing before you get busy setting your goals, unless you are the exception to the rule, plan on reviewing and reassessing your goals several times before you reach them, especially if they are loftier goals.
 
You can set this up as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly date. It really depends on the benchmarks you set and how long you’ve given yourself to meet your goal.
 
Regardless of how often you sit down to do this review, the most important thing is that you assess whether your goals—and the steps you’re taking—are still relevant and realistic. 
 
This “date with your goals” also gives you the chance to monitor your progress, which the AAP equates with a greater likelihood that you will succeed. Not to mention, these review sessions give you a chance to make adjustments and celebrate any successes you’ve achieved, which are both critical in this process.

Why do I feel strongly about that reason? Are you emotionally ready to commit to something that might be physically and or emotionally uncomfortable?

While intelligence is one of the most talked about subjects in psychology, there is no standard definition of what exactly constitutes intelligence. Some researchers have suggested that intelligence is a single, general ability. Others believe that intelligence encompasses a range of aptitudes, skills, and talents.
 
Intelligence has been a controversial topic throughout psychology's history. Despite the substantial interest in the subject, there is still considerable disagreement about what components makeup intelligence. In addition to questions of exactly how to define intelligence, the debate continues today about whether accurate measurements are even possible.
 
At various points throughout recent history, researchers have proposed some different definitions of intelligence. While these definitions can vary considerably from one theorist to the next, current conceptualizations tend to suggest that intelligence is the ability to:
 
Intelligence involves some different mental abilities including logic, reasoning, problem-solving, and planning. While the subject of intelligence is one of the largest and most heavily researched, it is also one of the topics that generate the greatest controversy.
 
While psychologists often disagree about the definition and causes of intelligence, research on intelligence plays a significant role in many areas. These areas include decisions regarding how much funding should be given to educational programs, the use of testing to screen job applicants, and the use of testing to identify children who need additional academic help.
 
The term ""intelligence quotient,"" or IQ, was first coined in the early 20th century by a German psychologist named William Stern. Psychologist Alfred Binet developed the very first intelligence tests to help the French government identify schoolchildren who needed extra academic assistance. Binet was the first to introduce the concept of mental age or a set of abilities that children of a certain age possess.﻿﻿
 
Since that time, intelligence testing has emerged as a widely used tool that has led to developing many other tests of skill and aptitude. However, it continues to spur debate and controversy over the use of such testing, cultural biases that may be involved, influences on intelligence, and even the very way we define intelligence.
 
Different researchers have proposed a variety of theories to explain the nature of intelligence. Here are some of the major theories of intelligence that have emerged during the last 100 years.
 
British psychologist Charles Spearman (1863–1945) described a concept he referred to as general intelligence or the g factor. After using a technique known as factor analysis to examine some mental aptitude tests, Spearman concluded that scores on these tests were remarkably similar.
 
People who performed well on one cognitive test tended to perform well on other tests, while those who scored badly on one test tended to score badly on others. He concluded that intelligence is a general cognitive ability that can be measured and numerically expressed.﻿﻿
 
Psychologist Louis L.Thurstone (1887–1955) offered a differing theory of intelligence. Instead of viewing intelligence as a single, general ability, Thurstone's theory focused on seven different primary mental abilities.﻿﻿
 
One of the more recent ideas to emerge is Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner proposed that the traditional idea of intelligence, based on IQ testing, did not fully and accurately depict a person's abilities. His theory proposed eight different intelligences based on skills and abilities that are valued in different cultures:﻿﻿
 
Psychologist Robert Sternberg defined intelligence as ""mental activity directed toward purposive adaptation to, selection, and shaping of real-world environments relevant to one's life.""
 
While he agreed with Gardner that intelligence is much broader than a single, general ability, he suggested that some of Gardner's types of intelligence are better viewed as individual talents. Sternberg proposed what he referred to as ""successful intelligence,"" which involves three different factors:﻿﻿
 
In order to gain a deeper understanding of intelligence and the tests developed to measure this concept, it's important to understand the history of intelligence testing, the research that has been conducted, and the findings that have emerged.
 
Major questions about intelligence and IQ testing still include:
 
To explore these questions, psychologists have conducted a considerable amount of research on the nature, influences, and effects of intelligence.﻿﻿
 
While there has been considerable debate over the exact nature of intelligence, no definitive conceptualization has emerged. Today, psychologists often account for the many theoretical viewpoints when discussing intelligence and acknowledge that this debate is ongoing.
 Learn from experience: The acquisition, retention, and use of knowledge is an important component of intelligence. Recognize problems: To put knowledge to use, people must be able to identify possible problems in the environment that need to be addressed. Solve problems: People must then be able to take what they have learned to come up with a useful solution to a problem they have noticed in the world around them.﻿﻿ Associative memory: The ability to memorize and recall Numerical ability: The ability to solve arithmetic problems Perceptual speed: The ability to see differences and similarities among objects Reasoning: The ability to find rules Spatial visualization: The ability to visualize relationships Verbal comprehension: The ability to define and understand words Word fluency: The ability to produce words rapidly Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence: The ability to control your body movements and to handle objects skillfully Interpersonal intelligence: The capacity to detect and respond appropriately to the moods, motivations, and desires of others Intrapersonal intelligence: The capacity to be self-aware and in tune with inner feelings, values, beliefs, and thinking processes Logical-mathematical intelligence: The ability to think conceptually and abstractly, and the capacity to discern logically or numerical patterns Musical intelligence: The ability to produce and appreciate rhythm, pitch, and timbre Naturalistic intelligence: The ability to recognize and categorize animals, plants, and other objects in nature Verbal-linguistic intelligence: Well-developed verbal skills and sensitivity to the sounds, meanings, and rhythms of words Visual-spatial intelligence: The capacity to think in images and pictures, to visualize accurately and abstractly Analytical intelligence: Your ability to evaluate information and solve problems Creative intelligence: Your ability to come up with new ideas Practical intelligence: Your ability to adapt to a changing environment Are intelligence tests biased?

Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge.
 
Motivation involves the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage, the term ""motivation"" is frequently used to describe why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions.
 
Motivation doesn't just refer to the factors that activate behaviors; it also involves the factors that direct and maintain these goal-directed actions (though such motives are rarely directly observable). As a result, we often have to infer the reasons why people do the things that they do based on observable behaviors.﻿﻿
 
What exactly lies behind the motivations for why we act? Psychologists have proposed different theories of motivation, including drive theory, instinct theory, and humanistic theory (such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs). The reality is that there are many different forces that guide and direct our motivations.
 
Different types of motivation are frequently described as being either extrinsic or intrinsic:
 
There are many different uses for motivation. It serves as a guiding force for all human behavior, but understanding how it works and the factors that may impact it can be important in a number of ways.
 
Understanding motivation can:
 
Anyone who has ever had a goal (like wanting to lose 20 pounds or run a marathon) probably immediately realizes that simply having the desire to accomplish something is not enough. Achieving such a goal requires the ability to persist through obstacles and endurance to keep going in spite of difficulties.
 
There are three major components of motivation: activation, persistence, and intensity.﻿﻿
 The degree of each of these components of motivation can impact whether or not you achieve your goal. Strong activation, for example, means that you are more likely to start pursuing a goal. Persistence and intensity will determine if you keep working toward that goal and how much effort you devote to reaching it. 
All people experience fluctuations in their motivation and willpower. Sometimes you might feel fired up and highly driven to reach your goals, while at other times you might feel listless or unsure of what you want or how to achieve it.
 
Even if you're feeling low on motivation, there are steps you can take that will keep you moving forward. Some things you can do include:
 
There are a few things you should watch for that might hurt your motivation. These include:
 Talk to your doctor if you are feeling symptoms of apathy and low mood that last longer than two weeks. Sometimes a persistent lack of motivation might be tied to a mental health condition such as depression. 
What are the things that actually motivate us to act? Throughout history, psychologists have proposed different theories to explain what motivates human behavior. The following are some of the major theories of motivation.
 
The instinct theory of motivation suggests that behaviors are motivated by instincts, which are fixed and inborn patterns of behavior.﻿﻿ Psychologists including William James, Sigmund Freud, and William McDougal have proposed a number of basic human drives that motivate behavior. Such instincts might include biological instincts that are important for an organism's survival such as fear, cleanliness, and love.
 
Many of your behaviors such as eating, drinking, and sleeping are motivated by biology. You have a biological need for food, water, and sleep. Therefore, you are motivated to eat, drink, and sleep. Drive theory suggests that people have basic biological drives and that behaviors are motivated by the need to fulfill these drives.﻿﻿
 
The arousal theory of motivation suggests that people are motivated to engage in behaviors that help them maintain their optimal level of arousal.﻿﻿ A person with low arousal needs might pursue relaxing activities such as reading a book, while those with high arousal needs might be motivated to engage in exciting, thrill-seeking behaviors, such as motorcycle racing.
 
Understanding motivation is important in many areas of life, from parenting to the workplace. You may want to set the best goals and establish the right reward systems to motivate others as well as to increase your own motivation.
 
Knowledge of motivating factors and manipulating them is used in marketing and other aspects of industrial psychology. It's an area where there are many myths and everyone can benefit from knowing what works and what doesn't.
 Extrinsic motivations are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise. Intrinsic motivations are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.﻿﻿ Help improve the efficiency of people as they work toward goals Help people take action Encourage people to engage in health-oriented behaviors Help people avoid unhealthy or maladaptive behaviors such as risk-taking and addiction Help people feel more in control of their lives Improve overall well-being and happiness Activation involves the decision to initiate a behavior, such as enrolling in a psychology class. Persistence is the continued effort toward a goal even though obstacles may exist. An example of persistence would be taking more psychology courses in order to earn a degree although it requires a significant investment of time, energy, and resources. Intensity can be seen in the concentration and vigor that goes into pursuing a goal.﻿﻿ For example, one student might coast by without much effort, while another student will study regularly, participate in discussions, and take advantage of research opportunities outside of class. The first student lacks intensity, while the second pursues their educational goals with greater intensity. Adjust your goals to focus on things that really matter to you If you're tackling something that is just too big or too overwhelming, break it up into smaller steps and try setting your sights on achieving that first step toward progress Improve your confidence Remind yourself about what you achieved in the past and what where your strengths lie If there are things you feel insecure about, try working on making improvements in those areas so that you feel more skilled and capable. Quick fixes or all-or-nothing thinking. It's easy to feel unmotivated if you can't fix something immediately or if you can't have it all at once. Remind yourself that reaching your goals takes time. Thinking that one size fits all. Just because an approach or method worked for someone else does not mean that it will work for you. If something isn't helping you reach your goals or is making you feel unmotivated, look for things that will work better for you.",motivation process initiate guide maintain goal orient behaviors cause act whether get glass water reduce thirst read book gain knowledge motivation involve biological emotional social cognitive force activate behavior everyday usage term motivation frequently use describe person something drive force behind human action motivation refer factor activate behaviors also involve factor direct maintain goal direct action though motives rarely directly observable result often infer reason people things base observable behaviors exactly lie behind motivations act psychologists propose different theories motivation include drive theory instinct theory humanistic theory maslow hierarchy need reality many different force guide direct motivations different type motivation frequently describe either extrinsic intrinsic many different use motivation serve guide force human behavior understand work factor may impact important number ways understand motivation anyone ever goal like want lose pound run marathon probably immediately realize simply desire accomplish something enough achieve goal require ability persist obstacles endurance keep spite difficulties three major components motivation activation persistence intensity degree components motivation impact whether achieve goal strong activation example mean likely start pursue goal persistence intensity determine keep work toward goal much effort devote reach people experience fluctuations motivation willpower sometimes might feel fire highly drive reach goals time might feel listless unsure want achieve even feel low motivation step take keep move forward things include things watch might hurt motivation include talk doctor feel symptoms apathy low mood last longer two weeks sometimes persistent lack motivation might tie mental health condition depression things actually motivate act throughout history psychologists propose different theories explain motivate human behavior follow major theories motivation instinct theory motivation suggest behaviors motivate instincts fix inborn pattern behavior psychologists include william jam sigmund freud william mcdougal propose number basic human drive motivate behavior instincts might include biological instincts important organism survival fear cleanliness love many behaviors eat drink sleep motivate biology biological need food water sleep therefore motivate eat drink sleep drive theory suggest people basic biological drive behaviors motivate need fulfill drive arousal theory motivation suggest people motivate engage behaviors help maintain optimal level arousal person low arousal need might pursue relax activities read book high arousal need might motivate engage excite thrill seek behaviors motorcycle race understand motivation important many areas life parent workplace may want set best goals establish right reward systems motivate others well increase motivation knowledge motivate factor manipulate use market aspects industrial psychology area many myths everyone benefit know work extrinsic motivations arise outside individual often involve reward trophies money social recognition praise intrinsic motivations arise within individual complicate crossword puzzle purely personal gratification solve problem help improve efficiency people work toward goals help people take action encourage people engage health orient behaviors help people avoid unhealthy maladaptive behaviors risk take addiction help people feel control live improve overall well happiness activation involve decision initiate behavior enrol psychology class persistence continue effort toward goal even though obstacles may exist example persistence would take psychology course order earn degree although require significant investment time energy resources intensity see concentration vigor pursue goal example one student might coast without much effort another student study regularly participate discussions take advantage research opportunities outside class first student lack intensity second pursue educational goals greater intensity adjust goals focus things really matter tackle something big overwhelm break smaller step try set sight achieve first step toward progress improve confidence remind achieve past strengths lie things feel insecure try work make improvements areas feel skilled capable quick fix nothing think easy feel unmotivated fix something immediately remind reach goals take time think one size fit approach method work someone else mean work something help reach goals make feel unmotivated look things work better

Most treatments for addiction involve some kind of ""talk therapy"" or counseling and focus on helping the person with the addiction to figure out why they continue to engage in addictive behaviors, despite problems developing as a result, and more effective ways of managing the feelings that underlie addictive behaviors. 
 
While these approaches to treatment are helpful to many people with addictions, some feel they need an approach that helps with the physical, as opposed to the mental or emotional aspects of addiction. Others find that exercise helps with managing cravings, as a backup therapy to talk therapy. Over the years, exercise has been recognized as a self-help tool among people recovering from addictions as support for recovery, but only recently has exercise been recognized as a treatment for addiction in its own right.
 
Withdrawal is an unpleasant experience that occurs when an addictive substance, such as alcohol or drugs, or addictive behavior, such as gambling, compulsive sex, or overeating, is discontinued. Withdrawal symptoms vary in intensity and which symptoms are experienced, depending on the individual and what they are withdrawing from, but central to all withdrawal syndromes is the craving for more of the substance or behavior, and the relief of withdrawal when more of the substance is taken, or the behavior is engaged in.﻿﻿
 
Feelings of depression or despair, anxiety or lethargy, irritability or anger, digestive problems, and nervous system symptoms such as sweating, dry or watery mouth, headaches, and muscle tension are common. Withdrawal symptoms for different substances may vary too:
 
Exercise has been repeatedly found to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. As these are major symptoms of withdrawal, experts are increasingly suggesting that exercise can alleviate withdrawal symptoms.﻿﻿
 
One type of withdrawal that has been shown to be helped by exercise is nicotine withdrawal. Numerous studies have shown that smokers who engage in bouts of exercise experience reduced cravings for cigarettes, improved mood, and reduced withdrawal symptoms compared with nonexercising people quitting smoking.﻿﻿ 
 
Exercise has been investigated as a treatment for reducing the risk of relapse to addictive behavior and has been shown to reduce drug cravings and improve treatment outcomes. People recovering from alcohol use disorder, who have completed the withdrawal phase of detox, have lower urges to drink when they are able to engage in bouts of exercise.﻿﻿ And people recovering from cannabis use disorder who engage in longer periods of exercise have reduced cravings for marijuana. 
 
Exercise has also been researched in combination with other treatments and found to be helpful when other therapies are used. Contingency management, a reward based system rather than a therapy, may also be more effective when combined with exercise-related activities.﻿﻿
 
Exercise appears to have great unexplored potential as a supplementary treatment for addictions.﻿﻿ Its beneficial effects both on mood, and on withdrawal symptoms, make it a good fit for helping people in recovery from addictions to feel better, to be healthier, and to avoid relapse, and may even help repair some of the neurological damage caused by substance use.
 
However, on its own, exercise won't help you to understand why you became addicted in the first place, to recognize triggers, or to learn more effective ways of managing your emotions—although in itself, it may help improve your emotional state, and it may improve the effectiveness of other therapies. There is also a small risk that you could exercise too much, and develop exercise addiction, although this is rare.﻿﻿ It is a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting an exercise regime, to make sure it is right for you.

Alcoholism is a family disease. It doesn't just affect the person suffering from addiction. The family's dynamic, mental and physical health, finances, and overall stability are affected.﻿﻿
 
The home environment is often tense and unpredictable. Family members may try to deny the drinker's behavior, make excuses for it, or attempt to control or stop it. These are all common responses to a home life that feels like it is out of control.
 
If your loved one is suffering from addiction, it's natural to wonder how to make them see that they need help. For you to be asking this question, it's likely that your loved one has gotten the point that they continue to drink in spite of obvious problems caused by their drinking.
 
Personal, social, and even legal problems that would cause most people to conclude that their drinking should be curtailed or eliminated don't typically affect alcoholics in the same way. It's important to understand that this is not a weakness—rather, the drinker is psychologically and physiologically addicted to the substance of alcohol and requires professional help.﻿﻿ 
 
The challenge to this is that many alcoholics are in denial that there is a problem. No matter how obvious the problem seems to those around the alcoholic, the alcohol-dependent person may loudly deny that drinking is the cause of their troubles, and may blame the circumstances or people around them instead.﻿﻿
 When people ask how to help the drinker in their lives, the answer they usually receive is, ""Unfortunately, there is not much anyone can do until the alcoholic admits they have a problem."" 
While it is true that your loved one needs to actively seek sobriety and want to change, you don't have to sit back and watch them self-destruct, hoping and praying that a light bulb goes off in their head. There are several things you can do to intervene, show your concern and support for your loved one, and protect yourself from getting too wrapped up in their addiction. 
 
The first step for family members and loved ones of a drinker is to inform themselves about the disease of alcoholism.﻿﻿ This helps you understand your loved one's behavior, and it helps you stop blaming them.
 
While the drinker needs to take responsibility for their actions in order to recover, alcoholism is a chronic disease, has defined symptoms, and is often triggered by genes and life circumstances. Above all, getting informed helps you see that your loved one is sick and suffering, not trying to hurt you.
 
As a family member, you can attend Al-Anon meetings or join an online group to learn more about the disease of alcoholism as well as the emotional and psychological toll it is taking on you. In Al-Anon, you learn how to detach from the alcoholic's problems—not the alcoholic. You will likely hear your own story in the stories of those who share with the group, creating a sense of solidarity and support.
 
You will also learn more about the unhealthy roles you may be playing in the life of the alcoholic, and whether or not your actions may actually be enabling the alcoholic to continue in their behavior, without you realizing it. (Take a quiz to find out if you are enabling your loved one's behavior.)
 If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 
This is a difficult conversation. Plan what you're going to say ahead of time. Wait until your loved one is sober and relatively emotionally stable. Make sure you are also feeling calm, as it is important that the drinker doesn't feel attacked.﻿﻿ Avoid accusatory language such as, ""You'd better get help or else.""
 
During this first discussion, it's important to show how much you care about your loved one. Be genuine and honest about your concerns, including how their drinking is affecting their health and the family as a whole. You can mention a particular problem that is arising from drinking, such as financial or relationship troubles.
 
Let your family member know you want to support them in stopping. Offer to help them find a treatment program, such as a 12-step program or a rehab facility, and perhaps to take over some of their responsibilities at home while they are taking time out for recovery. 
 Expect some pushback. The person may be in denial. Or if they aren't, they might suggest that they can quit on their own. This rarely ever works. However, you might discuss a timeframe and when you can expect changed behavior.﻿﻿ 
If this first attempt is not effective, which it often isn't—in fact, even when the drinker is committed to changing, it can take several rounds of treatment before they truly stop—the next step you might take is an intervention.﻿﻿ An intervention often includes other family members or friends that this person trusts, and consists of presenting treatment facility ideas as well as the consequences of their continued drinking.
 
Consequences might include refusing to pick up the financial or personal messes that the drinker is creating, taking away child visitation rights, spousal separation, or asking them to leave the home until they are ready to begin treatment. Often it's only when the consequences of drinking become painful enough that they become committed enough to pursue recovery.﻿﻿ 
 It can be very helpful to bring in a professional counselor or therapist during this stage. You might make an appointment and bring your loved one, or if they are unwilling, go yourself in order to develop your intervention strategy. 
After you've taken all these measures, remember that you cannot force your loved one into treatment. They have to make that decision themselves. All you can do is present options, offer support, and follow through with the consequences you presented.﻿﻿ The only person you control in this life is you. 
 
It's common to become overly focused on the drinker's actions and behavior, and obsessively worried, which takes the focus off your own life. This is defined as co-dependency, and it is destructive to your own mental and emotional health. A core tenet of Al-Anon is to stop trying to change your loved one and instead turn the focus back on yourself, the only one you can truly change. 
 
Even if your loved one does enter treatment and recovery, there will likely be many bumps along the way. Without alcohol as a coping mechanism, deeper issues tend to rise to the surface and must be dealt with.
 
Your loved one will need to continue practicing sobriety, and the changes they go through will affect you in ways big and small. It's helpful to continue attending Al-Anon meetings, to learn to differentiate between your issues and your loved one's issues, and take responsibility only for your own.

Many women recover from alcohol and drug addiction by making a decision to replace their addictions with new lifestyles. Contrary to popular belief, some women who recover from drug and alcohol addiction don't do so for their children or because they have a sudden ""wake up call"" about their problem, according to a small study of former female addicts.
 
These women — many of whom are over the age of 35 and hold a college degree — took a proactive role in overcoming substance abuse, replacing those addictions with new lifestyles that include school, work, community service, and physical exercise.
 
Women are the fastest-growing segment of substance abusers in the United States: About 2.7 million American women abuse alcohol or drugs, or one-quarter of all abusers, according to the federal Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. But there is little research on women's stories of how they recover from drug and alcohol addiction, according to Ohio University sociologist Judith Grant.
 
Grant, a visiting assistant professor, spent three years in a non-profit agency in Canada, where she worked as a researcher and educator with more than 300 female addicts enrolled in a recovery program. Many of the women faced different challenges than male addicts and devised unique ways to overcome substance abuse, Grant said.
 
To document their stories, the sociologist interviewed 12 Canadian women and 14 Ohio women who have been off drugs and alcohol for at least 18 months. She presented preliminary findings at the American Society of Criminology meeting in Chicago.
 
""While this study may not be reflective of all women addicts, it implies that some of the earlier studies may have mischaracterized addiction recovery for women. One concept the analysis refutes is that women abandon drugs and alcohol for the sake of their kids,"" said Grant. ""Children are important, but if these women don't recover for themselves, they generally relapse.""
 
The women also could not specify a ""turning point"" that prompted their recovery; for most the awareness of the need to overcome their substance abuse was a slow process, Grant found. And their success at recovery did not hinge on changing their identities from ""addict"" to ""ex-addict,"" as the literature suggests, but unearthing their real selves.
 
The women viewed using drugs and alcohol as an activity they were involved in, not an identity they had assumed. ""They bring back an old identity from before they got addicted, before the violence and drug abuse,"" she said. ""This is really me now,' they say. 'The blanket is gone.'""
 
Half of the women in the study had used a program such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous to overcome addiction, but the other half succeeded on their own. All of the women have replaced addiction with another passion in their lives, Grant said, ranging from physical exercise to volunteer work to school. Some now mentor other women who are overcoming addiction.
 
The participants began using drugs or alcohol in their teens or early 20s to mask the pain of family violence and incest, according to Grant, who added that all also reported having a family member who was an addict. These experiences produced crippling low self-esteem, a theme particular to these women's stories.
 
""I've never heard a male addict, to this day, in my work, talk about a 'lack of self-esteem,'"" said Grant, who hopes her findings will be of use to addiction recovery agencies and other organizations that assist women. The strong link between domestic violence and substance abuse should be acknowledged by addiction recovery centers and battered women shelters, she said, which tend to treat each problem in isolation.

The rates of smoking cigarettes among recovering alcoholics is three times that of the national average and research indicates that alcoholics are at greater risk for the negative health effects of smoking than other smokers.
 
An estimated 21% of the general population smoke cigarettes, but among chemically dependent people, the rate jumps to 80% to 95%. Researchers agree that the rate of smoking among recovering alcoholics is more than triple that of the general population.
 
Research also shows that because of the damage was done to the body by years of heavy drinking, recovering alcoholics who smoke are at a much greater risk of developing health problems related to smoking — particularly cancer and cardiovascular disease.
 
Consequently, the death rate for alcoholics following treatment is 48.1% within 20 years, compared with only 18.5% for the general population. More than half of those deaths are attributed to smoking (50.9%) compared with 34.1% for alcohol.
 
One reason few recovering alcoholics attempt to quit smoking is the belief that the stress of quitting smoking could jeopardize their sobriety. Few treatment centers require their patients to stop drinking and smoking at the same time, mainly because many of the people who work in the treatment industry are smokers themselves. Members of recovery groups are warned by other members to ""take one addiction at a time,"" further perpetuating the myth.
 
Scientific research, however, tells a different story. Research shows that nicotine can increase the craving for alcohol, especially for those who always drank and smoked at the same time.
 Several studies have found that quitting alcohol and cigarettes at the same time actually enhances the chances of maintaining sobriety. 
Most recovering alcoholics know they need to quit smoking and want to quit. A survey of people in treatment for alcohol dependence found that more than 50% said they wanted to quit and two-thirds of them had actually tried to quit at least once.
 
Typically, the main reason recovering alcoholics fail to quit smoking is because they try to do it on their own. Rather than using the same tools they used to quit drinking — medical treatment, professional counseling or support group participation — they try to quit smoking without assistance and often fail.
 
According to Terry Martin, the Verywell.com Smoking Cessation Expert, the vast majority of people who smoke fervently wish they did not. Quitting is not easy, no doubt about it. But it begins with having the will to quit. Martin provides lists of the benefits of quitting.
 
Experts agree that the key to successfully quitting is getting yourself prepared to quit psychologically — understanding the difficulties and preparing yourself to face them. Martin gives several tips on how to get ready to quit.
 
The good news about quitting smoking is that you don't have to do it alone. There are quit smoking aids available to help and a world of support out there to encourage you.
 
Thousands of people quit smoking every year, leaving their addiction to nicotine behind them and they immediately begin to see the healing process begin within the first 20 minutes of putting down that last cigarette.

If you are trying to maintain abstinence from alcohol or drugs over a long period of time, it is important to develop a drug-free lifestyle in all aspects of your life—at home, at work and during your leisure hours.
 
If you sought treatment from a professional rehab program for your alcohol or drug problem, one of the most important objectives of your continuing or follow-up care is to help you learn to replace your previous destructive behaviors with more healthy and productive alternatives.
 
One of the first steps in developing a drug-free lifestyle is to avoid those people who were directly involved in your former drinking or drug-using lifestyle—those who helped you get drugs, use drugs or were your drinking buddies. Many addicts find that in order to develop a substance-free lifestyle, they must develop new friendships, social patterns, and leisure activities.
 
Your rehab counselor will try to help you identify drug-free supportive friends and family members and encourage you to improve those relationships and participate in recreational activities with them, to replace the time that you spent drug-seeking and using. If you do not have drug-free friends or loved ones, your counselor will encourage you to become involved in new social groups and make new, supportive friends.
 
Another important aspect of developing a drug-free lifestyle is to develop a structured daily schedule that you can consistently follow. Structure and organization in your life can be your best friends in recovery, while a chaotic and disorganized lifestyle can be your enemy.
 
When you were in the early abstinence stage of your rehab program, your counselor probably worked with you then to establish daily and/or weekly schedule to help you begin to structure your time and to replace your drug-seeking and using activities with healthy alternatives. In the maintaining abstinence phase of your recovery, it is important not to abandon that structured schedule or deviate from it on a regular basis.
 
While maintaining your sobriety remains a high priority in your life, in order to develop a long-term drug-free lifestyle, it is helpful to identify larger goals for your future. Now that you have achieved more than 90 days of abstinence, you will probably begin to develop larger, long-term goals such as going back to school, changing career paths or saving toward financial goals.
 
Identifying other goals for your life and developing a plan to achieve those goals can play an important role in helping you develop and maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Your follow-up counselor will help you learn how to work toward these goals within the context of your new recovering lifestyle.
 
If you have participated in a 12-step group as part of your rehab program, you have probably already been introduced to the concept of spirituality, which has nothing to do with religious practices or dogma. Spirituality, as it relates to recovery, means developing values in your life and having altruistic goals—reaching beyond yourself to find fulfillment and happiness.
 
Spirituality can be an important factor in any successful recovery program. It involves connecting to a power that extends beyond the concerns of daily living. Your counselor will encourage you to become involved in efforts ""greater than yourself"" such as doing service work for your support group, becoming more involved in your religious organization, doing community service or volunteering for charity work.
 
Your counselor will not try to define any ""higher power"" for you—that will be left entirely up to you, but research has shown that developing a drug-free lifestyle can be enhanced by relating to a power that is transcendent and greater than yourself.

Many professional alcohol and drug treatment and rehabilitation programs include exercise as part of an overall program to help patients maintain abstinence and develop a more healthy lifestyle. Many residential treatment centers feature fully-equipped exercise facilities on the premises.
 
Traditionally, the main reason exercise has been recommended for those trying to quit alcohol and drugs is because it keeps them focused on something other than their withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Now, however, there may be evidence that exercise has additional benefits to those who want to avoid drinking and using drugs.
 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has set aside $4 million for scientific research to explore a possible role for physical activity in substance abuse and relapse prevention.
 
When announcing the funding, NIDA director Dr. Nora Volkow cited two studies that have shown exercise to be a benefit. In one, adolescents who exercised daily were half as likely to smoke cigarettes as their sedentary counterparts, and 40% less likely to experiment with marijuana.
 
In another study, women who were in a smoking-cessation program doubled their chances of quitting by adding exercise to their routines three days a week, compared to women in the study who did not exercise. They also had less weight gain.
 
If exercise can help people in residential treatment facilities and subjects in scientific studies, it can benefit anyone trying to quit drinking and drugging or striving to maintain abstinence.
 
Exercise is something to which everyone has access. You don't have to become a world-class athlete to enjoy the benefits of exercise as part of your recovery. You don't have to join a professional gymnasium, hire a personal trainer or buy expensive equipment, although those options can be beneficial also. Exercise is something that you can do on your own.
 
Not everyone is healthy enough to jump right into a full-blown exercise regime.
 If you have not exercised lately and you have been sedentary for more than a year, see your doctor and get a check-up before you begin any exercise program. 
If you have any medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure, you definitely need to check with your healthcare provider before beginning exercise. Also, if you are pregnant, have chronic back or neck pain or are recovering from an injury, check with your doctor first.
 
Sometimes, the hardest part of exercising is getting started. Long-time Verywell.com Exercise Expert Paige Waehner has some good tips on how to get motivated to exercise. She also points out how you can benefit from low-impact exercise, especially if you are a beginner.
 
Walking is a form of exercise that almost anyone can do and it can have significant benefits -- not only for cardiovascular health but also for weight loss. Verywell.com Walking Expert Wendy Bumgardner has tips for those new to walking for exercise and warns about mistakes you should avoid.
 
If walking is not enough exercise to keep up your interest, running or jogging is another option that you can do without a lot of expensive equipment or memberships. Running and Jogging Guide Christine Luff has an eight-week plan to help you get started and some tips on avoiding pain and injuries.

"
If you have decided that you need to get help for your drinking or drug abuse problem, you have already entered the first stage of recovery by admitting that you have a problem and seeking outside help.
 
This process -- reaching out for help and seeking some kind treatment or rehabilitation -- is known as treatment initiation. It is the first of four stages of recovery or rehab as described by the National Institute on Drug Abuse:
 
If you are like most people who seek help for substance abuse problems, in the very early stages you probably still harbor some feelings of ambivalence about giving up your drug of choice, and you may still be in denial about the full extent of your problem.
 
This is common for people in the early days. If you enter a professional rehab or treatment program, the first goal of the counselor or addiction treatment specialist will be to determine if you have any denial issues or ambivalent feelings.
 
Denial simply means refusing to believe the reality of your circumstances. Many people new to recovery usually have some level of denial about their addiction. Denial can take many forms, from thinking that you can still control your substance use to denying that you are really addicted.
 
The following erroneous beliefs are typical forms of denial:
 
Any of the above forms of denial can interfere with your recovery. The goal of professional treatment programs is to break through that denial and help you see the truth about your situation. Your counselor or caseworker may challenge and confront you in an effort to motivate you to change your mind.
 
Your counselor may remind you of all of the negative consequences that your substance abuse has had in your life or challenge you to abstain from drinking or drugging temporarily if you believe you are not really addicted. Either way, the goal is to get you to see the truth.
 
If you are in the early stages of seeking help for a substance abuse problem, you probably have some ambivalent feelings about giving up your drug of choice permanently. If you are like most alcoholics or addicts, you just can't image life without ever drinking or drugging again.
 
Chances are you decided to seek help in the first place because you experienced some negative consequences to your drug or alcohol use. You realized you needed help, but quitting completely for the rest of your life was not what you had in mind.
 
The following are reasons that many newcomers to recovery have feelings of ambivalence:
 
If you decided to seek help because you experienced some negative consequences, that may have been enough motivation to get you to admit you have a problem. But it may not be enough motivation for you to solve the problem.
 
If you have always turned to your drug of choice in times of stress, when you want to relax or when you are upset or angry, chances are you have ambivalent feelings about giving it up, unless you learn new coping skills.
 
Your counselor, in this early stage of treatment, will try to identify your ambivalent feelings and their underlying reasons. You will probably be asked to list your goals in life and shown how much easier it will be to meet those goals if you are living clean and sober.
 
Again, in the early stage of recovery and throughout your treatment process, the goal is to get you motivated to make positive changes in your life. Your treatment program is there to encourage and support your efforts to make those changes.
 
Return to The Four Stages of Recovery
 Treatment initiation Early abstinence Maintenance of abstinence Advanced recovery Believing that you are different from those ""real"" alcoholics and addicts. Thinking that you can solve your problem by ""cutting down"" rather than eliminating it completely. You may think that you can get your substance abuse back ""under control."" Refusing to believe that a secondary drug is also a problem. For example, an alcoholic thinking that continuing to smoke pot is okay or a cocaine addict refusing to think their drinking is a problem. Believing that Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous will not be helpful, because you are ""not like those people,"" because their problems are so severe. Insisting on continuing to spend time with ""friends"" who enable you by agreeing that drugs are not a problem or by using with you. You associate your drinking or drug use with a positive emotional change. You may turn to your drug of choice as a coping strategy and you do not yet know a better coping mechanism. You may feel too weak or helpless to break the cycle of addiction.

Most people who engage in addictive behaviors and go on to develop an actual addiction find that overcoming it is more challenging than they expected. Even though the difficulties people have with quitting drugs are well known, when people start using, they often feel that addiction is a myth and they can quit any time they want. Or they feel that they are an exception to the rule.
 
This is even more likely with non-substance, or behavioral, addictions involving activities such as excessive eating, sex, gambling, shopping, and exercise. What makes the situation even more complicated is that for every addictive behavior, there are some people who are able to engage in the behavior without developing an addiction.
 
This is true of all of the behavioral addictions (some of which involve healthy or necessary actions, like eating, exercise, and shopping). But it's also true of substance use. There are some cases of controlled drinking, recreational marijuana use, and even controlled heroin use.
 Most people think they are one of the lucky few who won't get hooked, and unfortunately, don't realize the truth until it is too late. 
By the time they recognize the need for change, they may not even want to. It can take years of being faced with the negative consequences of an addiction before realizing that it is causing significant problems.
 
But sooner or later, most people who have an addiction decide a change needs to happen. Once the decision is made, most people have a specific goal in mind. It might be to quit entirely, to quit some addictive behaviors or substances (but not all), to reduce the amount of time or money spent on addictive behaviors, or to reduce the harm of an addictive behavior.
 
For example, many drug users decide to quit heroin or meth but continue to drink alcohol, or smoke cigarettes or marijuana. Many heavy drinkers have the goal of just one drink a day, or only drinking socially. Getting clear on your goal before putting it into practice is helpful for success in changing an addictive behavior.
 Although quitting entirely is the best path to wellness, reducing or eliminating the most harmful substance use is a huge improvement and will greatly reduce the harm caused. 
The same is true of behavioral addictions: Anyone who decides to quit eating entirely is heading for an eating disorder. But stopping overeating and embracing a healthy diet is a healthy decision to change.
 
Complete abstinence from sex can be another form of sex addiction, known as sexual anorexia, yet developing healthy intimacy after a sex addiction can be greatly fulfilling. And reducing obsessive exercise to healthy levels is likely to improve health and wellness more than quitting exercise entirely.
 
Making the decision to change, and deciding what that change will look like, is a process that often takes a while. This is known as the contemplation stage because it involves contemplating, or thinking about, whether to change and what the change should involve.
 
Ambitious goals are not always best; it is better to set a goal that you will actually achieve than to plan to quit cold turkey and end up relapsing, which can be more dangerous than simply continuing without any changes. Consulting a doctor, addiction counselor, or psychologist is particularly helpful at this stage, as these professionals can help you understand the risks and what can help alleviate them.
 
Once you are clear on your goal, you may still need to prepare to change. Preparations include removing addictive substances from your home, as well as eliminating triggers in your life that may make you more likely to use those substances again.
 
People addicted to sex might need to dispose of porn and clear porn websites from their online history and favorites. Overeaters might need to go through their food cupboards and get rid of stockpiles of candy and cookies. Shopaholics and problem gamblers might need to cut up their credit cards and arrange with their bank to have just enough cash to cover bills and living expenses.
 
Perhaps the hardest preparations to make concern social relationships, which often revolve around addictive behaviors for people with addictions. Heavy drinkers often find joining a self-help group, such as AA, helpful for having a group of buddies who understand what they are going through.
 Suddenly quitting an addictive behavior can be lonely, especially if you have lost touch with people who don't indulge in the same behaviors. 
Take time to contact friends and family who will support you in your goals without being judgmental if times become hard and you slip up. You might also want to let those friends you drink, use drugs, or engage in addictive behaviors with know that you are planning to change.
 
They may not understand—or you may be pleasantly surprised. Either way, it's a good idea to let them know of your goal and what they can do to support it (even if that means taking a break from the friendship for a time).
 
For alcohol and drug addictions, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor or local drug clinic about whether you need medical help in quitting. There are options for medications to help alleviate withdrawal symptoms. If you have an underlying mental health problem, such as anxiety or depression, it could find worsen during the withdrawal phase. Typically, doctors and drug clinics are very supportive and helpful.
 
Quitting is a different experience for everyone. Some find the process liberating and empowering, and feel they can achieve anything. Others find it painful, difficult, and frustrating, sometimes needing many failed attempts before achieving their goal. Still others discover new sides to themselves during the quitting process (a greater capacity for compassion, for example).
 There is no ""right"" way to feel while you are quitting. But if you are feeling depressed or find yourself constantly wanting to return to the addictive behavior, you should seek support and treatment. 
There are many different treatments that can help you during the process of overcoming an addiction, including medical and psychological treatments. There is no one ""right"" type of treatment, although some approaches are better supported by research than others.
 
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) helps many people, and research shows it to be very effective in helping people overcome all kinds of addictions. But CBT is not for everyone. Other approaches may be better suited for those who do not relate well to analyzing their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
 
Mindfulness-based approaches have become much more popular and can be easier to relate to for many people. As with CBT, mindfulness is helpful for people with underlying mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression.
 
A variety of other treatments can be helpful, including couples counseling, family therapy, and neurotherapy. Medications can sometimes be helpful in the short term or the long term. Talk to your doctor about the options that are available to and appropriate for you.

Withdrawal symptoms can be a difficult aspect of overcoming addiction, both for substance and behavioral addictions. With substance addictions, the physiological aspects of withdrawal can be extremely uncomfortable, feeling like a bad flu, or can even be life-threatening. For this reason, it is a good idea to talk to a doctor about the best way and the best place to quit a substance.
 
Fortunately, most of the acute symptoms of withdrawal pass within a week or two of quitting. However, some people who quit an addiction find that certain withdrawal symptoms seem to go on and on. This is known as post-acute withdrawal syndrome, and it can go on for weeks, months, or even years in some cases.
 The risk of dying from an overdose is extremely high if you have been through withdrawal, as your tolerance of the drug will be much lower than it was before you quit. Make sure you have someone with you if you decide to use again. 
In addition, addictions can sometimes mask underlying mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and even psychosis. If you are feeling blue or agitated, or you are concerned that the world or other people seem strange or upsetting since you quit, talk with your doctor. There are effective treatments for these problems that are much more effective than addictive substances and behaviors.
 
No one who puts in the effort to cut down or quit an addictive behavior wants to fail. Yet relapse is more common than overcoming an addiction on the first try. This does not mean you will fail—it simply means that it might take a few tries for you to get it right.
 
One of the most common reasons for relapse is cravings. Cravings are strong urges to use or engage in the addictive behavior, and they are common during withdrawal. But they can also creep up suddenly and unexpectedly weeks, months, or years after quitting. Although they can feel intense, you can learn to cope with cravings without giving in to them.
 
Another common cause of relapse is thinking you have control now, and one drink, drug use, binge, or whatever won't matter. Well, it might and it might not. Sometimes a relapse is a single drink or use, and you might find you don't even enjoy it any more. Or it could be a slippery slope to using regularly or excessively again. It could even mean overdose or death.
 
It is important not to see relapse as a failure. The first thing to do when you realize you have relapsed is to understand what happened. Understanding why you relapsed is often one of the most important parts of truly overcoming an addiction.
 
Once you understand your triggers and weaknesses, you can put things in place to reduce the chance of relapsing again. You can then apply what you learned from the first time you quit or cut down to be more successful next time.
 
Even if your goal was to quit completely, you may decide at some point in the future that you want to be able to occasionally indulge without doing so excessively. This is possible, but it is important to be very clear about what it is you want to do. For example, if you want to be able to have an occasional drink with friends, then you need to be able to have one drink and then stop.
 
Many drinkers find it easier to stay completely abstinent than to drink occasionally. If you intend to have one drink and end up having several, you should reassess your goals and what is achievable for you at this time of your life. This might be a new experience for you, and it could be liberating. It could also seem boring and difficult.
 
Some people find that when they quit or change an addictive behavior, another comes along to replace it. Heavy drinkers and smokers often find themselves overeating and putting on weight. People struggling with sex addiction might find themselves obsessed with exercise.
 
Addictive behaviors have similar neurological and psychological processes and create rewarding feelings and sensations. So replacement addictive behaviors are common among those trying to overcome an addiction.
 
The trick to avoiding replacement addictions is to find satisfaction in the experiences of normal life. These experiences may lack the intensity and high of addictive behaviors, but getting to know and like them can introduce a new level of calm you may have never experienced before. Many people feel they are more in touch with reality and that relationships are more authentic than when they were constantly seeking pleasure.
 
The other important aspect of avoiding replacement addictions is to address any underlying mental health problems. Addictions can cover up past trauma, or underlying feelings of emptiness, sadness, or fear. Psychological therapies, as well as medications, can provide long-term relief for these problems, which addictions tend to worsen over time.
 
Your relationships and friendships are likely to change as you overcome your addiction. It may take time to appreciate a new normal. You may also be touched by the loyalty and simplicity of those who live life without chasing a high. You may find that friends and family whom you could not get along with while you were embroiled in your addiction welcome you back into their lives.
 However, it can also take time and effort for trust to be re-established if you have hurt friends or family while you were actively involved in your addiction. 
You may also find that you have less in common with the friends you spent the most time with during your addiction than you realized, and you might find they are intolerant to your new lifestyle. Remember, you are a great role model and doing these friends a great service by showing them that change is possible. That said, don't let them pull you back into the life you left behind.
 
Long-term recovery is not a final destination, but an ongoing process of facing and coping with life without retreating into addictive behaviors. It takes ongoing commitment, which can waver at any time—particularly times of stress. Seek help when you need it. Others in recovery, or professionals who work in addiction, understand that you still need support. We wish you well as you take this important step for your health.

Developmental psychologists have long been interested in how parents affect child development. However, finding actual cause-and-effect links between specific actions of parents and later behavior of children is very difficult.
 
Some children raised in dramatically different environments can later grow up to have remarkably similar personalities. Conversely, children who share a home and are raised in the same environment can grow up to have very different personalities.
 
Despite these challenges, researchers have posited that there are links between parenting styles and the effects these styles have on children. And some suggest these effects carry over into adult behavior.
 
In the 1960s, psychologist Diana Baumrind conducted a study on more than 100 preschool-age children. Using naturalistic observation, parental interviews, and other research methods, she identified some important dimensions of parenting.﻿﻿
 
These dimensions include disciplinary strategies, warmth and nurturing, communication styles, and expectations of maturity and control. Based on these dimensions, Baumrind suggested that the majority of parents display one of three different parenting styles. Later research by Maccoby and Martin suggested adding a fourth parenting style. Each of these has different effects on children's behavior.
 
In this style of parenting, children are expected to follow the strict rules established by the parents. Failure to follow such rules usually results in punishment. Authoritarian parents don't explain the reasoning behind these rules. If asked to explain, the parent might simply reply, ""Because I said so.""
 
While these parents have high demands, they are not very responsive to their children. They expect their children to behave exceptionally and not make errors, yet they provide very little direction about what their children should do or avoid in the future. Mistakes are punished, often quite harshly, yet their children are often left wondering exactly what they did wrong.
 
Baumrind says these parents ""are obedience- and status-oriented, and expect their orders to be obeyed without explanation."" They are often described as domineering and dictatorial. Their approach is ""spare the rod, spoil the child."" They expect children to obey without question.
 
Like authoritarian parents, those with an authoritative parenting style establish rules and guidelines that their children are expected to follow. However, this parenting style is much more democratic.
 
Authoritative parents are responsive to their children and willing to listen to questions. These parents expect a lot of their children, but they provide warmth, feedback, and adequate support. When children fail to meet the expectations, these parents are more nurturing and forgiving rather than punishing.
 
Baumrind says these parents ""monitor and impart clear standards for their children’s conduct. They are assertive, but not intrusive and restrictive. Their disciplinary methods are supportive, rather than punitive. They want their children to be assertive as well as socially responsible, and self-regulated as well as cooperative.""
 The combination of expectation and support helps children of authoritative parents develop skills such as independence, self-control, and self-regulation.  
Permissive parents, sometimes referred to as indulgent parents, make very few demands of their children. These parents rarely discipline their children because they have relatively low expectations of maturity and self-control.​
 
According to Baumrind, permissive parents ""are more responsive than they are demanding. They are nontraditional and lenient, do not require mature behavior, allow considerable self-regulation, and avoid confrontation."" Permissive parents are generally nurturing and communicative with their children, often taking on the status of a friend more than that of a parent.
 
In addition to the three major styles introduced by Baumrind, psychologists Eleanor Maccoby and John Martin proposed a fourth style: uninvolved or neglectful parenting. An uninvolved parenting style is characterized by few demands, low responsiveness, and very little communication.﻿﻿
 
While these parents fulfill the child's basic needs, they are generally detached from their child's life. They might make sure that their kids are fed and have shelter, but offer little to nothing in the way of guidance, structure, rules, or even support. In extreme cases, these parents may even reject or neglect the needs of their children.
 
What effect do these parenting styles have on child development outcomes? In addition to Baumrind's initial study of 100 preschool children, researchers have conducted a a number of studies about the impact of parenting styles on children. Among the findings:﻿﻿
 
Because authoritative parents are more likely to be viewed as reasonable, fair, and just, their children are more likely to comply with their parents' requests. Also, because these parents provide rules as well as explanations for these rules, children are much more likely to internalize these lessons.
 
Rather than simply following the rules because they fear punishment (as they might with authoritarian parents), the children of authoritative parents are able to see why the rules exist, understand that they are fair and acceptable, and strive to follow these rules to meet their own internalized sense of what is right and wrong.
 The parenting styles of individual parents also combine to create a unique blend in each family. For example, the mother may display an authoritative style while the father favors a more permissive approach. This can sometimes lead to mixed signals. In order to create a cohesive approach to parenting, it is essential that parents learn to cooperate and combinetheir unique parenting styles. 
Links between parenting styles and behavior are based on correlational research, which is helpful for finding relationships between variables but cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships. While there is evidence that a particular parenting style is linked to a certain pattern of behavior, other important variables such as a child's temperament can also play a major role.
 
There is also some evidence that a child's behavior can impact parenting styles. One study published in 2006 found that the parents of children who exhibited difficult behavior began to exhibit less parental control over time. Such results suggest that kids might misbehave not because their parents were too permissive, but because the parents of difficult or aggressive children gave up on trying to control their kids.﻿﻿
 
The researchers have also noted that the correlations between parenting styles and behaviors are sometimes weak.﻿﻿ In many cases, the expected child outcomes do not materialize; parents with authoritative styles have children who are defiant or who engage in delinquent behavior, while parents with permissive styles have children who are self-confident and academically successful.
 
Cultural factors also play an important role in parenting styles and child outcomes. ""There is no universally ""best"" style of parenting,"" writes author Douglas Bernstein in his book Essentials of Psychology. ""Authoritative parenting, which is so consistently linked with positive outcomes in European American families, is not related to better school performance among African American or Asian American youngsters.""﻿﻿
 
Parenting styles are associated with different child outcomes, and the authoritative style is generally linked to positive behaviors such as strong self-esteem and self-competence. However, other important factors including culture, children's temperament, children's perceptions of parental treatment, and social influences also play an important role in children's behavior.
 Authoritarian parenting styles generally lead to children who are obedient and proficient, but they rank lower in happiness, social competence, and self-esteem. Authoritative parenting styles tend to result in children who are happy, capable, and successful. Permissive parenting often results in children who rank low in happiness and self-regulation. These children are more likely to experience problems with authority and tend to perform poorly in school. Uninvolved parenting styles rank lowest across all life domains. These children tend to lack self-control, have low self-esteem, and are less competent than their peers.",developmental psychologists long interest parent affect child development however find actual

"
A substantial portion of our communication is nonverbal. Experts have found that every day we respond to thousands of nonverbal cues and behaviors including postures, facial expressions, eye gaze, gestures, and tone of voice. From our handshakes to our hairstyles, nonverbal details reveal who we are and impact how we relate to other people.
 Nonverbal communication types include facial expressions, gestures, paralinguistics such as loudness or tone of voice, body language, proxemics or personal space, eye gaze, haptics (touch), appearance, and artifacts. 
Scientific research on nonverbal communication and behavior began with the 1872 publication of Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Since that time, abundant research has been conducted regarding types, effects, and expressions of unspoken communication and behavior. While these signals are often so subtle that we are not consciously aware of them, research has identified several different nine types of nonverbal communication.
 
Facial expressions are responsible for a huge proportion of nonverbal communication.﻿﻿ Consider how much information can be conveyed with a smile or a frown. The look on a person's face is often the first thing we see, even before we hear what they have to say.
 
While nonverbal communication and behavior can vary dramatically between cultures, the facial expressions for happiness, sadness, anger, and fear are similar throughout the world.
 
Deliberate movements and signals are an important way to communicate meaning without words.﻿﻿ Common gestures include waving, pointing, and using fingers to indicate numeric amounts. Other gestures are arbitrary and related to culture.
 
In courtroom settings, lawyers have been known to utilize different nonverbal signals to attempt to sway juror opinions. An attorney might glance at his watch to suggest that the opposing lawyer's argument is tedious or might even roll his eyes at the testimony offered by a witness in an attempt to undermine his or her credibility.
 
These nonverbal signals are seen as being so powerful and influential that some judges even place limits on what type of nonverbal behaviors are allowed in the courtroom.
 
Paralinguistics refers to vocal communication that is separate from actual language.﻿﻿ This includes factors such as tone of voice, loudness, inflection, and pitch.
 
Consider the powerful effect that tone of voice can have on the meaning of a sentence. When said in a strong tone of voice, listeners might interpret approval and enthusiasm. The same words said in a hesitant tone of voice might convey disapproval and a lack of interest.
 
Consider all the different ways that simply changing your tone of voice might change the meaning of a sentence. A friend might ask you how you are doing, and you might respond with the standard ""I'm fine,"" but how you actually say those words might reveal a tremendous amount of how you are really feeling.
 
A cold tone of voice might suggest that you are actually not fine, but you don't wish to discuss it. A bright, happy tone of voice will reveal that you are actually doing quite well. A somber, downcast tone would indicate that you are the opposite of fine and that perhaps your friend should inquire further.
 
Posture and movement can also convey a great deal of information.﻿﻿ Research on body language has grown significantly since the 1970s, but popular media have focused on the over-interpretation of defensive postures, arm-crossing, and leg-crossing, especially after publishing Julius Fast's book Body Language.
 
While these nonverbal behaviors can indicate feelings and attitudes, research suggests that body language is far more subtle and less definitive than previously believed.
 
People often refer to their need for ""personal space,"" which is also an important type of nonverbal communication.﻿﻿ The amount of distance we need and the amount of space we perceive as belonging to us is influenced by a number of factors including social norms, cultural expectations, situational factors, personality characteristics, and level of familiarity.
 The amount of personal space needed when having a casual conversation with another person usually varies between 18 inches to four feet. On the other hand, the personal distance needed when speaking to a crowd of people is around 10 to 12 feet. 
The eyes play an important role in nonverbal communication and such things as looking, staring and blinking are important nonverbal behaviors. When people encounter people or things that they like, the rate of blinking increases and pupils dilate. Looking at another person can indicate a range of emotions including hostility, interest, and attraction.
 
People also utilize eye gaze as a means to determine if someone is being honest.﻿﻿ Normal, steady eye contact is often taken as a sign that a person is telling the truth and is trustworthy. Shifty eyes and an inability to maintain eye contact, on the other hand, is frequently seen as an indicator that someone is lying or being deceptive.
 
Communicating through touch is another important nonverbal behavior. There has been a substantial amount of research on the importance of touch in infancy and early childhood.
 
Harry Harlow's classic monkey study demonstrated how deprived touch and contact impedes development. Baby monkeys raised by wire mothers experienced permanent deficits in behavior and social interaction. Touch can be used to communicate affection, familiarity, sympathy, and other emotions.
 
In her book Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters, author Julia Wood writes that touch is also often used as a way to communicate both status and power.﻿﻿
 
Researchers have found that high-status individuals tend to invade other people's personal space with greater frequency and intensity than lower-status individuals. Sex differences also play a role in how people utilize touch to communicate meaning.
 Women tend to use touch to convey care, concern, and nurturance. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use touch to assert power or control over others. 
Our choice of color, clothing, hairstyles, and other factors affecting appearance are also considered a means of nonverbal communication.﻿﻿ Research on color psychology has demonstrated that different colors can evoke different moods. Appearance can also alter physiological reactions, judgments, and interpretations.
 
Just think of all the subtle judgments you quickly make about someone based on his or her appearance. These first impressions are important, which is why experts suggest that job seekers dress appropriately for interviews with potential employers.
 
Researchers have found that appearance can play a role in how people are perceived and even how much they earn. One 1996 study found that attorneys who were rated as more attractive than their peers earned nearly 15 percent more than those ranked as less attractive.
 
Culture is an important influence on how appearances are judged. While thinness tends to be valued in Western cultures, some African cultures relate full-figured bodies to better health, wealth, and social status.
 
Objects and images are also tools that can be used to communicate nonverbally. On an online forum, for example, you might select an avatar to represent your identity online and to communicate information about who you are and the things you like.
 
People often spend a great deal of time developing a particular image and surrounding themselves with objects designed to convey information about the things that are important to them.
 
Uniforms, for example, can be used to transmit a tremendous amount of information about a person. A soldier will don fatigues, a police officer will wear a uniform, and a doctor will wear a white lab coat. At a mere glance, these outfits tell people what a person does for a living.
 
Nonverbal communication plays an important role in how we convey meaning and information to others, as well as how we interpret the actions of those around us.
 
The important thing to remember when looking at such nonverbal behaviors is to consider the actions in groups. What a person actually says along with his or her expressions, appearance, and tone of voice might tell you a great deal about what that person is really trying to say.

Introversion is a personality trait characterized by a focus on internal feelings rather than on external sources of stimulation. Introverts and extroverts are often viewed in terms of two extreme opposites, but the truth is that most people lie somewhere in the middle.
 
While introverts make up an estimated 25 to 40 percent of the population, there are still many misconceptions about this personality type. It is also important to note that introversion is not the same thing as social anxiety or shyness. Being an introvert does not mean that you are socially anxious or shy.
 
Introversion is one of the major personality traits identified in many theories of personality.
 People who are introverted tend to be inward turning, or focused more on internal thoughts, feelings and moods rather than seeking out external stimulation. 
Introversion is generally viewed as existing as part of a continuum along with extroversion. Introversion indicates one end of the scale, while extroversion represents the other end.
 
The terms introversion and extroversion (also often spelled extraversion) were popularized through the work of Carl Jung and later became central parts of other prominent theories including the big 5 theory of personality. The introversion-extroversion dimension is also one of the four areas identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). According to many theories of personality, everyone has some degree of both introversion and extroversion. However, people often tend to lean one way or the other.
 
Introverts tend to be more quiet, reserved, and introspective. Unlike extroverts who gain energy from social interaction, introverts have to expend energy in social situations. After attending a party or spending time in a large group of people, introverts often feel a need to ""recharge"" by spending a period of time alone.﻿﻿
 
In order to know why some people are introverted and some people are extroverted, it is important to understand the role that your body's physiology plays. The way that your body responds to the outside environment plays a critical role in determining your level of extroversion and introversion.
 
On a physiological level, a network of neurons located in the brainstem known as the reticular activating system (RAS) is responsible for regulating arousal levels including wakefulness and transitions between sleeping and waking.﻿﻿
 
The RAS also plays a role in controlling how much information you take in while you are awake. When confronted by potential threats in the environment, the RAS will increase your arousal levels in order for you to be alert and ready to deal with the danger. Each person has a basic set point in terms of arousal level. Some people tend to naturally have a much higher set point, while others have a much lower set point.
 
The psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested that these arousal levels could be thought of as a continuum. According to his arousal theory of extroversion:
 
According to Eysenck's theory, introverts are those that have naturally high levels of arousal. Because introverts tend to experience chronically high arousal levels, they tend to seek activities and environments where they can escape from overstimulation. Because of their naturally high arousal levels, they are more alert and take in more information from the environment. Escaping somewhere to have time alone to recharge gives them the opportunity to process and reflect on what they have learned.
 
Do you assume that you know who is an introvert and who isn't? While you might think of an introvert as a shy wallflower who prefers to stay home alone instead of socializing, introverts can actually come in many types with a wide variety of characteristics.
 
There are certainly plenty of introverts who are socially reserved and who would prefer to stay home and read a book rather than go to a big party, but there are also plenty of introverts who enjoy socializing. You might even be surprised to learn that many people who you think of as ""social butterflies"" might actually be quite introverted.
 
The following are just a few of the signs that you (or someone you know) might be an introvert.
 
Do you ever feel exhausted after spending time with a lot of people? After a day interacting with others, do you often need to retreat to a quiet place and have an extended amount of time all to yourself? One of the major characteristics of this personality type is that introverts have to expend energy in social situations, unlike extroverts who gain energy from such interactions.﻿﻿
 
That doesn't mean that all introverts avoid social events altogether.
 
Many introverts actually enjoy spending time around others, with one key caveat—introverts tend to prefer the company of close friends. While an extrovert might go to a party with the goal to meet new people, an introvert intends to spend quality time talking to good friends.
 
As an introvert, your idea of a good time is a quiet afternoon to yourself to enjoy your hobbies and interests.
 
A few hours alone with a good book, a peaceful nature walk or your favorite television program are great ways to help you feel recharged and energized.
 
This does not mean that the average introvert wants to be alone all the time. Many introverts love spending time with friends and interacting with familiar people in social situations. The key thing to remember is that after a long day of social activity, an introvert will probably want to retreat to a quiet place to think, reflect, and recharge.
 
If having a few hours to be alone sounds like your idea of a good time, you just might be an introvert.
 
One common misconception about introverts is that they don't like people. While introverts typically do not enjoy a great deal of socializing, they do enjoy having a small group of friends to whom they are particularly close. Instead of having a large social circle of people they know only on a superficial level, introverts prefer to stick to deep, long-lasting relationships marked by a great deal of closeness and intimacy.
 
Researchers have found that people high in this trait tend to have a smaller group of friends. While extroverts generally have a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, introverts typically choose their friends much more carefully. Their closest relationships tend to be profound and significant. They also prefer to interact with people on a one-on-one basis rather than in a large group setting.
 
If your social circle tends to be small but very close, there's a pretty good chance you are an introvert.
 
Introverts are often described as quiet, reserved, mellow and are sometimes mistaken for being shy.
 
While some introverts certainly are shy, people certainly should not mistake an introvert's reserve for timidity. In many cases, people with this personality type simply prefer to choose their words carefully and not waste time or energy on needless chit-chat.
 
If you are the quiet type and a bit reserved, you probably are an introvert.
 
When introverts have to spend time in activities or environments that are very hectic, they can end up feeling unfocused and overwhelmed. Extroverts, on the other hand, tend to thrive in situations where there is a lot of activity and few chances of becoming bored.
 
According to at least one study, researchers have found that introverts tend to be more easily distracted than extroverts,﻿﻿ which is part of the reason why introverts tend to prefer a quieter, less harried setting.
 
If you tend to feel overwhelmed in busy social situations, you probably tend to be an introvert.
 
Because introverts tend to be inward-turning, they also spend a great deal of time examining their own internal experiences. If you feel like you have a very good knowledge and insight into yourself, your motivations, and your feelings, you might be more of an introvert.
 
Introverts tend to enjoy simply thinking about and examining things in their own minds. Self-awareness and self-understanding is important to introverts, so they often devote a great deal of time to learning more about themselves. This might involve exploring hobbies they enjoy, thinking about their lives, and reading books that explore themes and topics that are important to them.
 
If you feel that you are self-aware and enjoy gaining deep knowledge about yourself, then you might be more of an introvert.
 
Where extroverts tend to prefer to jump right in and learn through hands-on experience, introverts typically prefer learning through observation. While extroverts typically learn through trial and error, introverts learn best by watching.
 
Introverts like to watch others perform a task, often repeatedly, until they feel that they can replicate the actions on their own. When introverts do learn from personal experience, they prefer to practice somewhere private where they can build their skills and abilities without having to perform for an audience.
 
If you like to learn more by watching rather than doing, there is a chance that you have a more introverted personality.
 
As you might imagine, jobs that require a great deal of social interaction usually hold little appeal to people high in introversion. On the other hand, careers that involve working independently are often a great choice for introverts. For example, an introvert might enjoy working as a writer, accountant, computer programmer, graphic designer, pharmacist, or artist.
 
It is important to note that introversion does not necessarily equate with shyness. In their book, The Development of Shyness and Social Withdrawal, authors Schmidt and Buss write, ""Sociability refers to the motive, strong or weak, of wanting to be with others, whereas shyness refers to behavior when with others, inhibited or uninhibited, as well as feelings of tension and discomfort.""
 Shyness indicates a fear of people or social situations. Introverts, on the other hand, simply do not like to spend lots of time interacting with other people. 
However, introverts do appreciate being around people to whom they are close. They find engaging in ""small talk"" tedious but do enjoy having deep, meaningful conversations. Introverts also tend to think about things before talking. They want to have a full understanding of a concept before they voice an opinion or try to offer an explanation.
 
In an excellent article in Atlantic Monthly, author Jonathan Rauch took on some of the common myths and misconceptions about introverts. While introverts are often labeled as shy, aloof, and arrogant, Rauch explains that these perceptions result from the failure of extroverts to understand how introverts function.
 
""Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion,"" Rauch suggests. ""They assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often take umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain the matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really understood.""
 
According to estimates, extroverts outnumber introverts by about three to one.﻿﻿ Introverts often find that other people try to change them or even suggest that there is something ""wrong"" with them. Nothing could be further from the truth. While introverts make up a smaller portion of the population, there is no right or wrong personality type. Instead, both introverts and extroverts should strive to understand each other's differences and similarities.
 
Remember, introversion is not an all-or-nothing characteristic. People can be what you might call introverts with a capital I (aka ""very introverted"") or they might be outgoing in some situations with some introverted tendencies. Introversion exists on a continuum with extroversion, and most people tend to lie somewhere between the two.
 
If you identify with some characteristics of introversion and some characteristics of extroversion, then there is a pretty good chance that you are one of the 70 percent of people who fall somewhere in the middle. Ambiverts tend to enjoy both spending time with others and spending time alone,﻿﻿ depending on the situation and their needs at the moment.
 
Most importantly, remember that one type isn't ""better"" than the other. Each tendency can have benefits and drawbacks depending on the situation. By better understanding your personality, however, you can learn how to play to your strengths.
 
If you are an introvert, find ways to cope if the stimulation from the outside world becomes too much. Seek out a quiet moment where you can get away from overwhelming noises and recharge.
 
In one study of adult introverts between the ages of 18 and 80, those who had strong social relationships and emotional regulation skills were found to be happier than those who did not have those skills. Make the most of your strengths by nurturing your close relationships in order to foster strong social connections and utilize your tendency to look inward in order to develop solid emotional understanding.
 
Introversion is perfectly normal. If you find, however, that your introverted tendencies are the result of anxiety that impacts your normal, day-to-day functioning, consult your physician or mental health professional.

Do you love meeting new people? Does a big social event leave you feeling energized and renewed? If you can answer yes to these questions, then there is a possibility that you might be an extrovert.
 
There is a lot of talk these days about the distinction between extroverts and introverts, which is often treated as an either/or trait. Introversion and extroversion are one of the major personality dimensions that make up the five-factor model of personality.
 
According to this theory, personality is made up of five broad dimensions. Each dimension exists on a continuum. While some people might tend to be at the extreme end of either side, most people are somewhere more in the middle.﻿﻿ So while you might have a lot of traits that make you an extrovert, you might also find yourself sometimes exhibiting traits that are more introverted in nature.
 
On the positive side, extroverts are often described as talkative, sociable, action-oriented, enthusiastic, friendly, and out-going. On the negative side, they are sometimes described as attention-seeking, easily distracted, and unable to spend time alone. Extroverts are also more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors, including risky health behaviors.
 Some of the general characteristics associated with extroversion include: 
Extroversion has been correlated with a number of different outcomes. Among the positive outcomes, extroverts tend to spend more time with other people, spend more time engaged in social activities, and tend to have more friends. Research has also suggested that extroverts tend to be happier than introverts as well as being less prone to certain psychological disorders.﻿﻿
 
Think you might be an extrovert? Check out our list of five of the key traits common to this type of personality.﻿﻿
 
You don't just enjoy talking to friends, family members, and co-workers; you love to strike up conversations with total strangers. You love to meet new people and learn about their lives. Unlike introverts who tend to think before they speak, extroverts tend to speak as a way to explore and organize their thoughts and ideas.
 
Extroverts also tend to have a wide circle of friends. Since you are so good at meeting new people, striking up conversations, and you genuinely enjoy the company of others, it probably is no surprise that making friends comes easily.
 
Do you tend to feel ""charged up"" and inspired after you've spent some time with other people? Extroverts tend to find such social interactions refreshing and they actually gain energy from such exchanges.
 
When extroverts have to spend a lot of time alone, they often begin to feel uninspired and listless. If given a choice between spending time alone and spending time with other people, an extrovert will almost always choose to spend time with a group.
 
When you are facing a problem, you prefer to discuss the issues and various options with others. Talking about it helps you explore the issue in-depth and figure out which option might work the best. After a difficult day at work or school, talking about it with friends or family can help you feel less stressed out. Introverts, on the other hand, prefer to think about problems and spend time alone after a trying day.
 
Since people with this personality type love interacting with other people so much, others tend to find extroverts likable and easy to approach. At a party, an extrovert will probably be the first one to walk up to new guests and make introductions. It is for this reason that extroverts typically find it easy to meet new people and make new friends.
 
While introverts are sometimes perceived as closed-off and aloof, extroverts are typically very open and willing to share their thoughts and feelings. Because of this, other people generally find that extroverts are easier to get to know.
 
Remember that extroversion isn't an all or nothing trait; it's actually a continuum and some people might be very extroverted while others are less so. Extroversion is more common than introversion and is often valued since extroverts tend to be skilled at interacting with others.
 
This does not mean, however, that one personality type is 'better' than another. Each type has its own pluses and minuses, and you may even find that you are extroverted in some situations and more introverted in others.

Research has demonstrated a strong link between eating breakfast and positive performance in school. A 2013 study on how breakfast affects kids' school performance and behavior found that eating breakfast every day is ""positively associated with improved school performance.""﻿﻿ Other research has suggested that the quality of the breakfast, that is, one that includes nutritional foods, also had a positive impact.﻿﻿
 
Conduct your own psychology experiment by examining the impact that breakfast has on academic performance or school behavior.
 
The first step in developing your project is to form a research question that can be used to create a testable hypothesis. Here are some questions to consider:
 
After you have selected a research question that you would like to investigate, the next step is to create a hypothesis. Your hypothesis is an educated guess about what you expect will happen. For example, your hypothesis might be one of the following:
 
Talk to your instructor about finding possible participants for your experiment. In some cases, other students in your class may act as participants, or you may be required to post ads looking for subjects. Be sure to get permission from your instructor before advancing any further.
 
Once you have some participants, create the materials you will use in your study. For example, you may need to create a survey to ask students about their eating habits or a quiz to test students on academic performance.
 
Finally, identify the key variables in your experiment. These variables will differ depending on the hypothesis you choose to investigate. For example, your independent variable might be ""Breakfast Consumption"" and your dependent variable might be ""Performance on a Math Test.""
 
After collecting the data for your experiment, analyze your results. Did the independent variable have an impact on the dependent variable? Were the results significant? Prepare to report and present the results in the manner suggested by your instructors, such as a lab report or other type of psychology paper.
 Will students who eat breakfast perform better on a math test than students who have not eaten a morning meal? Do students who don't eat breakfast before school have a more difficult time staying on task? Does the content of the meal have an impact on school performance? For example, does eating a Pop-Tart have the same beneficial effects as eating a bowl of oatmeal and fresh fruit? What effect does eating breakfast have on vocabulary test performance? Does eating breakfast provided by the school produce different results than eating a breakfast prepared at home? Students who eat breakfast will perform better on a math test than students who don't eat breakfast. Students who don't eat breakfast will spend more time off-task than students who do eat breakfast. Students who eat a nutritious breakfast will perform better on an academic test than students who consume unhealthy foods for breakfast.",research demonstrate strong link eat breakfast positive performance school study breakfast affect kid school performance behavior find eat breakfast every day positively associate improve school performance research suggest quality breakfast one include nutritional foods also positive impact conduct psychology experiment examine impact breakfast academic performance school behavior first step develop project form research question use create testable hypothesis question consider select research question would like investigate next step create hypothesis hypothesis educate guess expect happen example hypothesis might one follow talk instructor find possible participants experiment case students class may act participants may require post ads look subject sure get permission instructor advance participants create materials use study example may need create survey ask students eat habit quiz test students academic performance finally identify key variables experiment variables differ depend hypothesis choose investigate example independent variable might breakfast consumption dependent variable might performance math test collect data experiment analyze result independent variable impact dependent variable result significant prepare report present result manner suggest instructors lab report type psychology paper students eat breakfast perform better math test students eat morning meal students eat breakfast school difficult time stay task content meal impact school performance example eat pop tart beneficial effect eat bowl oatmeal fresh fruit effect eat breakfast vocabulary test performance eat breakfast provide school produce different result eat breakfast prepare home students eat breakfast perform better math test students eat breakfast students eat breakfast spend time task students eat breakfast students eat nutritious breakfast perform better academic test students consume unhealthy foods breakfast

Individuals with social intelligence can sense how other people feel, know intuitively what to say in social situations, and seem self-assured, even in a larger crowd. You might think of these folk as having “people skills,” but what they truly possess is social intelligence.
 
The theory of social intelligence was first brought to the forefront by American psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1920.﻿﻿ He defined it as, “The ability to understand and manage men and women and boys and girls, to act wisely in human relations.” No one is born socially intelligent. Instead, it involves a set of skills that an individual learns over time.
 
People who are socially intelligent display core traits that help them communicate and connect with others.
 
While some people may seem to develop social intelligence without really trying, others have to work to develop it. Luckily, certain strategies can help a person build social skills. These tactics can help you develop social intelligence:
 
Social intelligence isn’t easy to master—if it were, there wouldn’t ever be another awkward conversation at a party. However, working toward a strong social intelligence can lead to a richer life—or, at least, an easier time making a few new friends.
 
Study social situations. Pay attention to what people are doing well and the mistakes you want to avoid. Afterward, think about what you want to do differently in the next social situation you enter.
 
Get proactive about improving your skills. And remember, that you're going to mess up sometimes. Learn from your failures as well as your successes.
 Effective Listening: A person who possesses social intelligence doesn’t listen merely to respond but truly pays attention to what a person is saying. The other folks in the conversation walk away feeling like they were understood and that they made a connection. Conversational Skills: Have you ever seen someone “work the room?” They have conversational skills that enable them to carry on a discussion with practically anybody. They’re tactful, appropriate, humorous and sincere in these conversations, and they remember details about people that allow the dialogue to be more meaningful.﻿﻿ Reputation Management: Socially intelligent people consider the impression that they make on other people. Considered one of the most complex elements of social intelligence, managing a reputation requires careful balance—a person must thoughtfully create an impression on another person while still being authentic. Lack of Arguing: Someone with social intelligence understands that arguing or proving a point by making another person feel bad isn’t the way to go. They don’t outright reject another person’s ideas, but rather listen to them with an open mind—even when it’s not an idea that they personally agree with. Pay close attention to what (and who) is around you. Socially intelligent people are observant and pay attention to subtle social cues from those around them.﻿﻿ If you think that someone in your life has strong people skills, watch how they interact with others. Work on increasing your emotional intelligence. Although similar to social intelligence, emotional intelligence is more about how you control your own emotions and how you empathize with others. It requires recognizing when you’re experiencing an emotion—which will help you recognize that emotion in others—and regulating them appropriately. An emotionally intelligent person can recognize and control negative feelings, such as frustration or anger, when in a social setting.﻿﻿ Respect cultural differences. More than that, seek out cultural differences so you can understand them. Although most people learn people skills from their family, friends and the community surrounding them, a socially intelligent person understands that others might have different responses and customs based on their upbringing. Practice active listening.  Develop your social intelligence by working on your communication skills—which requires active listening.﻿﻿ Don’t interrupt. Take time to think about what someone else is saying before you respond. Listen to the inflections in what others say, which can give you clues to what they really mean.

Expertise is what separates the amateur from the true master in almost any field, from medicine to science to sports to artistic performance. The idea of whether experts are ""born"" or ""made"" relates to the age-old nature versus nurture debate in psychology—do genetics or experience play more of a role in shaping who we are? In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of attention paid to the ""made"" aspect of the debate. Expertise is acquired through dedicated practice, many experts in the field suggest.
 
But how exactly do people go about becoming experts? Are some people simply born with the requisite talent, or can anyone become an expert with the proper study and training?
 
While it might be easy to point out who is and is not an expert, agreeing on a formal definition of expertise is not always so easy. Is it about how much you know? Is it about being able to perform an action well? And at what point does a person move from being merely good at something to being a bona fide expert?
 
""Expertise is consensually defined as elite, peak, or exceptionally high levels of performance on a particular task or within a given domain,"" explained researcher Lyle E. Bourne, Jr. of the University of Colorado, Boulder and his colleagues in an article published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. ""One who achieves this status is called an expert or some related term, such as virtuoso, master, maven, prodigy, or genius. These terms are meant to label someone whose performance is at the top of the game. An expert's field of expertise can be almost anything from craftsmanship, through sports and music, to science or mathematics.""
 
So why do we so often label expertise with different terms? Each word tends to have its own subtle nuance that conveys what type of expert a person might be. If their expertise is perceived as being the result of hard work and practice, we might describe them as a master or a virtuoso. If people see their abilities as arising from pure inborn talent, they might be referred to as a genius or a prodigy.
 
Some of the critical components of expertise are knowledge, skill, and achievement. People who become experts tend to acquire a body of knowledge that makes them one of the most informed individuals in their field. They also possess the skills that they need to determine when and how to utilize their knowledge. Such skills are often learned, but they can also be influenced by natural talent and ability. Finally, people who possess expertise also tend to excel in their field and achieve far above and beyond what the average person does.
 
Recently, a popular idea has emerged that the key to becoming an expert was devoting at least 10,000 hours to the study and practice of a subject. In a 1993 study, researchers found that the most accomplished violinists at a music academy had spent an average of 10,000 hours practicing their instrument by the age of 20. Pop psychology author Malcolm Gladwell coined the phrase ""the ten-thousand-hour rule"" in his best-selling 2008 book Outliers.
 
Gladwell pointed to the results of the music study as well as observations that musical greats The Beatles had likely spent around 10,000 hours practicing playing music during the early 1960s. Gladwell also suggested that tech-entrepreneur Bill Gates had devoted 10,000 hours to practicing programming before he created Microsoft. According to Gladwell, a person could become an expert in nearly any field as long as they were willing to devote the requisite 10,000 hours to studying and practicing the subject or skill.
 
The idea has become enormously popular outside of academics, but just how true are the claims? Can spending 10,000 hours on a subject really guarantee that you will become an expert?
 
Anders Ericsson of the University of Florida is a world-renowned expert on peak performance and author of Peak: The New Science of Expertise. He has studied experts from all walks of life including areas such as chess, sports, music, and medicine. He is also the researcher behind the study from which Gladwell drew his conclusions about what it takes to become an expert.
 
Ericcson points out a few key problems with the ""ten-thousand-hour rule"":
 
Ericsson believes that what separates the amateur from the expert is what is referred to as deliberate practice. Ordinary practice can help people become skilled at a task, but gaining true expertise involves practicing in a way that pushes the boundaries of current skill levels and knowledge. Such practice is highly concentrated and involves working on things that are outside of your current skill-level, setting goals, and receiving training and instruction from a qualified teacher.
 Just putting in 10,000 hours rehearsing the same things over and over again is not enough to become a true expert. Instead, concentrated, goal-directed, deliberate practice that stretches your abilities beyond your comfort zone is what you should pursue if you want to gain expertise in any area. 
While Ericsson believes that deliberate practice is the key to becoming an expert, not all researchers agree with his conclusions. Some recent studies have found that while the deliberate practice is certainly important, it is not the only factor that explains the differences between the skilled and the unskilled. While psychologists are not yet sure exactly which factors might also play a role, personality traits, physical characteristics, and overall intelligence may matter as well.
 
So can you really become an expert in anything as long as you are willing to devote the time and effort to it? It's a question that psychologists continue to ponder, although there is little doubt that practicing regularly will lead to an improvement in both skills and knowledge. Whether you might eventually be able to become a true master in that specific domain is something that may only be known once you try. Before you decide to pursue it, consider whether you have the interest, dedication, and time to commit to gaining expertise in that domain.
 
So what does it really take to gain true expertise? What steps do you need to follow in order to become an expert?
 
While the 10,000-hour rule is more pop-psych myth than reality, there is one aspect of the idea that is accurate—becoming an expert takes a great deal of effort. People who become experts in any field devote a tremendous amount of time, energy, and hard work toward learning and practicing their skill. If you want to master something, you need to be willing to put in the time. It might not take exactly 10,000 hours, but it will take a lot.
 
One study found that out of three different types of study preparation, the deliberate practice was the most effective. Researchers looked at participants in the National Spelling Bee and compared study methods with performance. Deliberate practice, defined as studying and memorizing words alone, was more effective than reading for pleasure and being quizzed by others as a study method.
 
Interestingly, the deliberate practice was also rated as the least enjoyable and most difficult study technique. Participants who persisted with the technique also possessed higher levels of the personality trait called grit, also known as mental toughness. The researchers suggest that this mental toughness may sometimes be an important part of being able to stick with deliberate practice. While it was less intrinsically rewarding, those with grit were able to persevere and keep their eyes on their long-term goals, making them more likely to stick with the deliberate practice and more likely to perform better during competition.
 
One recent study, however, found that deliberate practice may actually be less important than previously believed. Researchers Brooke Macnamara, David Z. Hambrick and Frederick Oswald found that the amount of accumulated practice did not play a major role in explaining individual differences when it came to performance or skill.
 
In a meta-analysis of previous studies, the researchers found that practice accounted for just 12 percent of the individual differences found in performance.
 
However, a practice still mattered. On almost all of the studies included in the analysis, there was a positive relationship between practice and performance. The more people practiced, the better they performed in their area of interest.
 
What the researchers found was that the domain itself also mattered. When it came to education, practice only accounted for four percent of differences in individual performance. This number jumped up to 18 percent for sports, 21 percent for music, and 26 percent for games. In other words, practice played a greater role in improving performance for activities such as music, athletics, and games, and less of a role for professional or educational performance.
 
So what else might be important in the development of expertise?
 
Practice is essential for developing a skill, but becoming an expert requires constantly challenging yourself to do better, learn more, and acquire new knowledge and skills. Simply rehearsing the same skills over and over again will make you better in those areas, but it won't lead to true expertise.
 
The seminal educational psychologist Lev Vygotsky proposed an important learning concept known as the zone of proximal development. This zone included the skills that were just outside of a person's current ability level. While a person might not yet be able to do these things on their own, they can achieve them with the assistance of a more skilled mentor. By continually reaching for these new skills, mastering them, and then progressively expanding this zone of proximal development, people are able to learn and develop their abilities.
 
Becoming an expert requires constantly working within this zone of proximal development. Even once you have become very good at a skill within a particular domain, this does not mean that even greater expertise is out of reach. More learning, more knowledge, and better performance are still possible with further challenge and practice.
 
While we often think that it's intelligence that separates the experts from the rest of us, research suggests that true expertise has more to do with acquired knowledge than inborn mental abilities. Some people might be born with natural resources including physical abilities and access to the tools they need that allow them to achieve this expertise more readily. But becoming an expert takes effort and practice, no matter what your natural ability levels are at the start.
 
And even the experts are not always perfect. Experts do make mistakes, but they're also ready to catch their own errors and eager to learn from them. Mistakes are a form of feedback. They tell us not only what not to do, but also provide information on what we might try instead. Experts are able to spot these mistakes, correct course, and apply this knowledge in the future.
 
Researchers continue to debate exactly what it takes to become an expert. There is no doubt, however, that it requires time, practice, and dedication.
 First, while the students in the music study were very good violinists by age 20, they were not masters. In other words, they were excellent players, but that did not necessarily mean they were masters of their craft. Ericsson suggests that it is sometimes around the 20,000- to 25,000-hour mark that people truly become experts or masters of a skill or subject. Secondly, not all skills are the same. Some skills require far fewer than 10,000 hours to reach the expert level, while others require much more. Ericsson also points out that Gladwell's interpretation of his research is flawed. While Gladwell assumed that all of the violinists in the music study had put in the 10,000 hours of practice, that number was really only an average. Half of the violists studied by Ericsson and his colleagues spent less than 10,000 hours practicing their instruments by the age of 20, while half spent more.",expertise separate amateur true master

As if eating disorders themselves weren’t hard enough to manage, patients have been handed a whole new challenge in the form of a pandemic requiring social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic is changing our entire way of living. For those with eating disorders and disordered eating, it creates new stressors and disruptions to treatment plans.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Because of the risk of contagion, it appears that all but a few providers of the lower levels of care—individual outpatient, intensive outpatient, and partial hospitalization programs—are moving to virtual treatment models, meaning that patients have video sessions from home. Some of these programs usually provide up to 11 hours per day of programming along with meals. Patients in such programs will now be living at home and have greater responsibility for their own meals.
 
At higher levels of care, most residential treatment centers and medical hospitalization units for eating disorder patients are still operating but might be reducing the number of admissions to prevent the potential transmission of the virus.
 Preliminary reports suggest that the criteria for admission are becoming more stringent in the face of COVID-19. Thus, it may become harder for people with eating disorders to access these levels of care, with only those with significant medical complications being able to obtain residential and inpatient treatment. 
With in-person sessions restricted or no longer available due to appropriate social distancing, a major concern for many is whether insurance companies will cover comparable coverage for telehealth. While many states and companies have announced telehealth coverage for behavioral health services, this does not fully answer the question.
 
Many patients may still have employer plans that do not cover telehealth—it is not clear when or whether these policies will be amended. The speed at which this transition has occurred means that it is taking time for programs and providers to adapt. There may be temporary disruptions in treatment.
 
The COVID-19 crisis is a time of heightened stress for everyone, with a lot of unknowns. Routines are disrupted. People with busy lives are now stuck at home with much less to do. The loss of structure can be challenging.
 
Social distancing is necessary to help prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19, but it also comes with added difficulties. It separates many people from the supports on which they rely; in other cases, it may confine them at home in a relatively small space, sometimes with people with whom they may have had conflict. People are also restricted from activities which they may have successfully used to cope: exercise, support groups, and treatment providers.
 
While most people have difficulty with extended periods of uncertainty, for people with eating disorders, who tend to be more rigid and can have trouble with flexibility, the difficulty is greater. During times of stress, people automatically tend to revert to their past coping strategies. For those with eating disorders, these often include eating disorder behaviors.
 
For a person with an eating disorder, grocery shopping can already be an overwhelming experience. Add the long lines and frenzied behavior of “stocking up,” and it becomes even more fraught.
 Food shortages in the supermarket can bring up a lot of anxiety for people who have experienced food deprivation in the form of dieting. They may trigger an urge to binge or hoard food. 
People who can only comfortably eat a narrow range of foods may face anxiety if they can’t find their preferred foods or subsist solely on low energy fresh foods for long periods of quarantine. They may have to tackle their fear of higher-calorie, energy-dense, shelf-stable foods such as rice and pasta to get through this. Conversely, large stockpiles of energy-dense food at home can increase anxiety and be a trigger for binge eating.
 
Accept your feelings and know that you are not alone. Remember that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and unmoored. We all feel this way. This is an unprecedented time that none of us have dealt with before.
 
Allow space to mourn your losses. Whether you are a high school senior whose prom has been canceled, a college student whose senior spring semester and graduation activities have been canceled, a parent who will not see your child graduate, a person who has lost a job, or a spouse whose partner is a healthcare worker treating people with the illness, we are all facing enormous losses right now. Allow yourself space to grieve and experience the whole range of emotions that ensue.
 
Ask for help. If you’ve been putting off getting help for your eating disorder or are experiencing increased anxiety, now is a good time to reach out. There are numerous therapists, dietitians, and treatment centers providing services through telehealth. In addition, many treatment centers have added virtual support groups and many providers are offering meal support via Facebook live or Instagram live.
 
Recognize that online therapy works. If viewing your therapist, doctor, or dietitian over the computer is new to you, recognize that there is a long and good history of treatment being provided this way. The first video telepsychiatry link occurred in 1997. Research indicates that telehealth is appropriate for many populations and can be as effective as sessions delivered in person. It may just take a little adjustment.
 
Eating disorders thrive in isolation, so stay connected to your support system. Now more than ever, we need our supports. Even though we’re social distancing, we are social beings who need connection. Use the internet to connect with family, friends, and people in your professional life. Don’t just text but do facetime and video chats. Have a video meal with a friend. Many people are having online cocktail parties, Netflix watch parties, and the like.
 
Most people do better with structure. Create a routine that involves getting up, getting dressed, and doing something every day that feels productive. Your new routine should include your mealtimes—this is very important for everyone, but also people with either current or past disordered eating behaviors.
 
Find activities that bring you joy or develop a skill. Engaging in such activities is a way to prevent depression.
 
Try to incorporate as many activities of your “former” life into your shelter in place life. If there was something you were doing before, see if you can find an online equivalent. There is an incredible and increasing number of online activities in which you can participate from home, including Broadway shows, new movies, museum tours, classes, and so on.
 
An eating disorder recovery plan includes 3 meals a day and 2 to 3 snacks evenly spaced throughout the day. You should always have a general idea of what and when your next meal or snack will be. This applies to everyone, but especially those struggling with disordered eating behaviors.
 
Having a structure and a plan to prevent grazing will help you to regulate your hunger and satiety cues, reduce binge eating, avoid undereating, and manage your food supply on the sparsest number of shopping trips. Make sure to plan meals that are satisfying physically and emotionally.
 
Depriving yourself of adequate nutrition and enjoyable foods is not going to keep you safe from a virus. On the other hand, staying emotionally satisfied and nourished will help stabilize your blood sugar levels, mood, and emotional coping.
 
The foods you will need during the pandemic may be the very foods you fear and have avoided. Those sustaining shelf-stable foods like pasta and rice, potatoes, bread, crackers, and chips are easiest to stock up on and keep for a long time. Canned and frozen foods and processed foods are all fine.
 
Foods like pizza and macaroni and cheese and baked goods are comforting and provide needed energy. Now is the time to face them and start incorporating them. Just plan them into your regular meals and snacks. All food is good.
 
It’s not surprising that you are feeling overwhelmed and soothed yourself with food. Accept that eating to self-soothe can be a wise way to cope. But, if it’s your only coping skill, it can be helpful to learn to utilize some other coping skills too. Try to resist urges to compensate.
 If you eat something you didn't plan to, accept that it happened and move on. You are not a failure! Don’t perpetuate the cycle by restricting; instead get back on track with your next scheduled meal. 
This is where it gets personal. If exercise was a part of your eating disorder this may be a perfect time for a planned break. Take it! You are not required to exercise. If you are far enough along in recovery and your team has said it is okay to reintroduce exercise or exercise has not been a part of your eating disorder, then you may continue with some moderate exercise as you wish.
 
Although you may be separated from your gym, it is still safe to walk or run outside, hike away from crowds, and do an online workout. Try to keep it fun. But please monitor this and make sure it does not become excessive or compulsive.
 
Time at home may provide a temporary respite for those who feared being judged about their appearance. You may want to just hang out in your pajamas all day and not get dressed. That’s okay. But if you find that it makes you feel worse about your body, then consider getting dressed and primped as you would normally. Limit body checking.
 
Do not make jokes about how much weight you are going to gain during social distancing. This is fat-phobic, adds unnecessarily to people’s worries, and honestly should be the least of our collective concerns at this time. Weight stigma is a health risk factor that doesn’t need to be added to the pile.
 
We must work together to make the world a safer place for all bodies. Your body weight is not something that you can control—attempting to do so only backfires. Work on intuitive eating which relieves you from weight fluctuations.
 
If you are a parent and your teen or young adult has come home from treatment or has moved home with you, you can play an important role. Parent-assisted treatments such as Family-Based Treatment can be effective.
 
People with eating disorders may be at increased risk from the virus so please take extra precautions to protect yourself or those people with eating disorders in your life.
 
Try to get regular sleep. Try to get some time outdoors when you can. Do some meditation or relaxation. Take time to rest. Be patient with yourself. Having a toolkit of healthy coping skills can help you better manage the stress you feel.
 
These are indeed challenging times. We don’t necessarily have all the answers. But we are all in this together and we will get through it.

When COVID-19 became a pandemic, the way we communicate changed seemingly overnight. To help minimize the spread, many of us have altered the majority of our interactions with other people.
 
This includes shifting from in-person conversations to online modes of communication such as video conferencing, phone calls, texts, or email, and wearing masks while indoors or when social distancing is not possible.﻿﻿ 
 
And while this “new normal” is something that we will continue to adapt to, it comes at a highly emotional time with a certain level of confusion, frustration, and a loss of in-person connection we are used to.
 
“Communication is hard enough when things are relatively quiet in our lives but in the midst of a crisis or stress, emotions make communication challenging and require a great deal of effort to ensure that misunderstandings are minimized,"" explains licensed clinical psychologist, Kevin Gilliland, Psy.D., Executive Director of Innovation 360.
 
Now is the time to be flexible and adaptable when it comes to how we express ourselves to others. It's crucial we show compassion and kindness to each other as we maneuver through these changes.﻿﻿ And most importantly, be willing to advocate for individual needs, whether they are for yourself or someone else. 
 “In the midst of a crisis or stress, emotions make communication challenging and require a great deal of effort to ensure that misunderstandings are minimized. 
Cheryl Dixon, a communications strategist and an adjunct professor at Columbia University and New York University, reminds us that more than 90% of communication is nonverbal,﻿﻿ and that it’s been proven that we tend to trust nonverbal communication cues over verbal language.﻿﻿
 
Moreover, Dixon says we use nonverbal communication to convey meaning, to modify or complement our verbal messages, and to regulate the flow of our interaction. “We are losing a lot of nonverbal cues, including proxemics (our spatial environment; how closely we position ourselves to others, the amount of space we take up) and kinesics (our body movements and gestures),” explains Dixon. 
 When we communicate via video, we lose the benefit of seeing certain aspects of body language. When we wear masks, Dixon says we lose the ability to interpret critical facial expressions, plus, our own ability to convey emotion through facial expression is limited.  
To make up for these limitations, Dixon says it is helpful to use language and tone to express emotions. For example, saying, “That makes me so happy to hear” with a smile (or instead of a smile if you're wearing a mask.) She also recommends that you perform a check-in for understanding by asking questions so that the communication is balanced and flows between participants.
 
During a video chat, Dixon says it’s common for people to be distracted by their surroundings, which is easily perceived as boredom or disinterest. “Being mindful to be present and focused, avoid multitasking, and minimizing possible distractions will increase engagement and strengthen interaction,” she says. 
 
Those who are deaf or hard of hearing, in particular, are facing significant struggles with communication during COVID-19. Laurene E. Simms, Ph.D., Interim Chief Bilingual Officer at Gallaudet University, says that for the millions of Americans who have some degree of hearing loss,﻿﻿ the fundamental issue is access to their personal relationships as well as accurate and timely information about COVID-19 and access to the public health system.
 
“COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of Deaf-signing Americans, who number more than an estimated 2 million-plus. Within the Deaf American population, there are Deaf people of color who are even more vulnerable during this time﻿﻿ as they too often are not provided access to accurate information and public health care due to blatant discrimination, socioeconomic status, and lack of resources such as educational opportunities and transportation,” Simms explains.﻿﻿
 “Within the Deaf American population, there are deaf people of color who are even more vulnerable during this time as they too often are not provided access to accurate information and public health care due to blatant discrimination, socioeconomic status, and lack of resources such as educational opportunities and transportation. 
Simms also points out that being isolated at home, especially when the other members of the household do not sign, is adding to the stress. This is especially true for the majority of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, Simms says, since more than 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents.﻿﻿ 
 
Not having access to accurate and timely information is another significant issue within the Deaf community.
 
Although many briefings about COVID-19 have closed captioning, Simms says this form of communication has many inherent limitations. “In many cases, you have to have a high reading level to read them and English is not the first language for many deaf people, plus, it is typically acquired through print rather than speech,” she says. 
 
Moreover, captions often omit information, are often inaccurate and hard to read, and the emotional tone of the speaker is lost in written captions.﻿﻿ Consequently, Simms says Deaf-signing Americans are often left out of important information such as public health mandates related to social distancing, stay at home, hygiene, and mask-wearing.
 
When it comes to the loss of facial cues due to masks, Simms says for Deaf Americans, facial cues expressions play a very important part in the meaning of a sign, and also signal grammatical elements.﻿﻿ “For hearing-speaking persons, facial expressions are nonverbal cues that support the spoken language, but ASL, in comparison, relies on facial cues and expressions along with eye gaze, head tilts, cheek puffs, and mouthing. As such, wearing a face mask disrupts the grammar of ASL,” she explains. 
 
To manage this situation, Simms says Deaf signing people are resorting to writing notes, texting, and gestures. But this puts many Deaf Americans at risk, she says, because some may have less reading proficiency and less exposure to medical terminology. “As such, they may all not be able to write about medical issues with a high degree of precision,” adds Simms.
 
When it comes to managing telehealth during COVID-19, the Deaf and hard of hearing community is relying on guidelines published by the National Association of the Deaf. There is also a section for healthcare providers on telehealth for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
 
First of all, says Gilliland, we need to stop comparing how we communicate now to how we used to communicate; it’s not going to help us move forward because this is not an event that only requires us to make a few tweaks in our lives. “This is a new way of living, and the more creative and open we can be about doing new things, the better we’re going to do,” he explains. 
 
We also need to slow down when we communicate. “Our normal lines of communication are down, it’s a highly emotional time, and trying to do too much too fast is going to end poorly,” Gilliland says. “We can’t afford to be in a hurry when it comes to communicating right now, so allow some extra time for a longer conversation about an issue,” he says.
 Gilliland also recommends having a follow-up conversation if you think the other person may have misunderstood you, just to clarify what you were trying to say. It’s OK to over-communicate right now even if you tend to shy away from that sort of thing. 
Another strategy, says Emily Hu, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist with Thrive Psychology Group in Southern California, is to step up the communication in general. “There are gaps going on right now that we ordinarily wouldn’t have, so you’ll need to work extra hard to make sure your point is getting across correctly, whether that’s asking the other person to repeat back what you said, communicating your emotions in addition to your words, or otherwise making sure they’re getting the whole message,” she explains.  
 “There are gaps going on right now that we ordinarily wouldn’t have, so you’ll need to work extra hard to make sure your point is getting across correctly. 
When interacting with the same people, Hu recommends figuring out what method of communication works best with each individual person. “Some people will do better with videoconferencing than others, while some will prefer texts. Try out different methods and find the match that works not just for the other people in your social network but for you yourself, and then stick with it the best you can,” she says.
 Whenever possible, try to do a video conference or at least phone calls instead of text or email, as this might save at least some of that organic feeling of the conversation flowing naturally. 
But if you are using email or text, make sure to ask for clarification if you’re concerned that you’re not reading the tone correctly or you’re having trouble figuring out what the other person is feeling. Hu says, don’t be afraid to ask them directly since this will save a lot of heartaches later.
 
And most importantly, Hu says, be compassionate. “You’re going to misread other people sometimes or be misread yourself. Rather than jumping immediately to guilt or anger, remember that we’re all struggling to learn a whole new way of communicating during this pandemic. Give yourself room to make mistakes.”
 Life has changed drastically in the last several months, and how we communicate must change, too. Learning new ways to interact has proven to be a challenge, but one we can get through. Whether it’s asking for clarification when talking with a mask on or requesting video conferencing for work meetings, advocating for what works best for you while also practicing kindness and grace with other people will help make this process go a lot smoother for everyone.  Audio communication and some aspects of video eliminate crucial elements of non-verbal expression, and in person, masks prevent us from picking up on important facial cues. The Deaf and hard of hearing community is especially affected due to the way masks muffle voices and inhibit lip-reading. Experts agree we must be willing to adapt to this new normal, which means being more intentional with our tone and language choices.",covid become pandemic way communicate change seemingly overnight

Without commutes, regular school schedules, and pre-pandemic socialization levels, Americans seem to be catching up on sleep, a recent study in Current Biology found.﻿﻿ But don't think of this as a COVID-19 silver lining quite yet. Unfortunately, some research suggests sleep quality may not come along with adding duration to your sleep sessions.
 
Researchers at the University of Colorado compared sleep prior to and during stay-at-home orders for 139 university students and found they slept longer by about half an hour nightly.﻿﻿ Also, the timing of sleep became more regular, thanks in large part to less ""social jetlag,"" which means varying a sleep schedule based on evening activities.
 
Insufficient sleep duration, irregular sleep timing, and social jetlag are common in the U.S., and have been linked to major health risks like obesity, heart disease, and mood disorders, as well as impaired immune health,﻿﻿ according to the study's lead author, Kenneth Wright, PhD, of the University of Colorado, Boulder's Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory.
 
However, better sleep behaviors is just the first step, since sleep quality can have a major impact as well.
 
A survey done by The Better Sleep Council in March compared findings to their annual sleep study done in January of this year.﻿﻿ Obviously, a great deal occurred within that 3-month timeframe, which prompted the organization to do the post-COVID questionnaire.
 
They found that in January, 43 percent of Americans described their sleep as poor or fair, but just a few months later, that increased to 52 percent. That shift was reflected in a question about waking up refreshed as well. In January, 30 percent said they regularly felt well-rested on waking, but in March, that had dropped to 24 percent.﻿﻿

That shift was reflected in a question about waking up refreshed as well. In January, 30 percent said they regularly felt well-rested on waking, but in March, that had dropped to 24 percent. 
Americans seem to be trying to connect with others about the problem as well. In the survey, negative posts on social media related to sleep jumped from 45 percent of all sleep-related posts to 73 percent compared to March 2019.﻿﻿
 
Researchers suggested this is likely happening due to higher stress levels, which were also up by 12 percent since January, and survey respondents noted they were feeling anxious about their health, the economy, and their personal finances.
 
With a global pandemic, it's not surprising there would be similar struggles around the world, and sleeping does seem to be one of them.
 
Another recent study published in Current Biology recruited 435 participants in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland and recorded their sleep duration and perceptions of sleep quality over a six-week period.﻿﻿
 
They found that people were sleeping for more time—nearly an hour longer than pre-pandemic levels—but that didn't necessarily translate to better quality sleep. Although participants were able to set sleep schedules according to internal biological signals rather than external cues like socializing in the evening, researchers noted they reported more problems falling asleep, they woke more often during the night and had lighter sleep that caused them to be disturbed by noise.﻿﻿
 
These sleep difficulties led to daytime fatigue, feeling tired upon waking, and overall dissatisfaction with sleep.
 ""This is not unexpected, given that we're in an unprecedented situation which is associated with a considerable increase in self-perceived burdens. In general, too, sleep quality does not equal sleep duration, although duration is an aspect of it. 
For Americans, and anyone else around the world, the emphasis shouldn't be on sleeping longer as much as it should be on sleeping better, says Blume, the lead author of the global study. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies that can help, and right now, exercise and spending time outdoors top the list, she believes.
 
""We have all been indoors more for months, and we know from extensive research that being outdoors, and enjoying fresh air, even in an urban environment, can help us reset,"" says Blume. That doesn't just mean our moods, it's also our circadian rhythms and internal clocks, she adds. When that happens, deeper sleep can often result.﻿﻿
 
Pairing that with exercise can be particularly potent. The connection between regular exercise and quality sleep is well established. According to a 2011 study published in Mental Health and Physical Activity, those who were active fell asleep faster and felt less daytime sleepiness and fatigue.﻿﻿
 More exercise and better sleep becomes part of a healthy cycle, because with more satisfying, uninterrupted sleep, you're able to reduce levels of cortisol, the hormone most related to the stress response, according to W. Chris Winter, MD, owner of the Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine clinic and author of The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix it. As your cortisol levels lower in the evening, melatonin—a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland to induce drowsiness—is released to help keep you on a normal sleep-wake cycle.﻿﻿ With your stress lowered, you sleep better—which, in turn, reduces your stress levels even more. And during a global pandemic, that can be a boon to emotional and physical health. Although Americans may be getting more sleep in general, sleep quality doesn't seem to be improving. According to recent research, this balance of more sleep but less quality appears to be a global issue. Focusing on non-sleep strategies like exercise and getting fresh air can help benefit your sleep overall.",without commute regular school schedule pre pandemic socialization level americans seem catch sleep recent study current biology find think covid silver line quite yet unfortunately research suggest sleep quality may come along add duration sleep sessions researchers university colorado compare sleep prior stay home order university students find sleep longer half hour nightly also time sleep become regular thank large part less social jetlag mean vary sleep schedule base even activities insufficient sleep duration irregular sleep time social jetlag common link major health risk like obesity heart disease mood disorder well impair immune health accord study lead author kenneth wright phd university colorado boulder sleep chronobiology laboratory however better sleep behaviors first step since sleep quality major impact well survey better sleep council march compare find annual sleep study january year obviously great deal occur within month timeframe prompt organization post covid questionnaire find january percent americans describe sleep poor fair months later increase percent shift reflect question wake refresh well january percent say regularly felt well rest wake march drop percent better sleep council find january percent americans describe sleep poor fair months later increase percent shift reflect question wake refresh well january percent say regularly felt well rest wake march drop percent americans seem try connect others problem well survey negative post social media relate sleep jump percent sleep relate post percent compare march researchers suggest likely happen due higher stress level also percent since january survey respondents note feel anxious health economy personal finance global pandemic surprise would similar struggle around world sleep seem one another recent study publish current biology recruit participants austria germany switzerland record sleep duration perceptions sleep quality six week period find people sleep time nearly hour longer pre pandemic level necessarily translate better quality sleep although participants able set sleep schedule accord internal biological signal rather external cue like socialize even researchers note report problems fall asleep wake often night lighter sleep cause disturb noise sleep difficulties lead daytime fatigue feel tire upon wake overall dissatisfaction sleep unexpected give unprecedented situation associate considerable increase self perceive burden general sleep quality equal sleep duration although duration aspect americans anyone else around world emphasis sleep longer much sleep better say blume lead author global study fortunately number strategies help right exercise spend time outdoors top list believe indoors months know extensive research outdoors enjoy fresh air even urban environment help reset say blume mean moods also circadian rhythms internal clock add happen deeper sleep often result pair exercise particularly potent connection regular exercise quality sleep well establish accord study publish mental health physical activity active fell asleep faster felt less daytime sleepiness fatigue exercise better sleep become part healthy cycle satisfy uninterrupted sleep able reduce level cortisol hormone relate stress response accord chris winter owner charlottesville neurology sleep medicine clinic author sleep solution sleep break fix cortisol level lower even melatonin natural hormone produce pineal gland induce drowsiness release help keep normal sleep wake cycle stress lower sleep better turn reduce stress level even global pandemic boon emotional physical health although americans may get sleep general sleep quality seem improve accord recent research balance sleep less quality appear global issue focus non sleep strategies like exercise get fresh air help benefit sleep overall

Significant focus on mental health during COVID-19 has been centered around the impact of isolation and loneliness, and for good reason. Numerous studies have shown that lack of social interaction with others can not only lead to depression,﻿﻿ but possibly even shorten your life.﻿﻿
 On the other side of the spectrum are the families who aren't used to this much togetherness. Adult kids may have moved back in, younger kids who were doing their school work virtually are still at home instead of at summer camp, work-life boundaries have essentially been erased, and domestic duties are a battleground. It all adds up to tension, and no matter what your situation is, you're certainly not alone. 
""Initially, many families and couples enjoyed the extra time together, but then it just dragged on,"" says psychotherapist Carrie Mead, LCPC. ""Many have not been able to achieve a healthy balance of quiet, independent, self-directed time while still meeting the needs of their partners, children, and other family members.""
 
Part of the difficulty is the misguided idea that when you love someone, you'd choose to spend all your time with that person, says psychotherapist Dana Dorfman, Ph.D., MSW. There's a reason the old saying ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" has endured.
 
""Physical and emotional separations or boundaries are essential to healthy adult relationships,"" she says. ""While humans are social creatures who rely on relationships and connection for emotional survival, we also need time alone to think, nourish, and care for ourselves. That's what replenishes our individuality.""
 
Sometimes, it may be more difficult to carve out alone time if you're part of a couple rather than in a family, because it might feel to the other person—and even to yourself—like rejection instead of self-care. But that can fuel more feelings of stress.
 ""From what I've seen with my clients, everyone is feeling smothered and overwhelmed with the lack of separation. This has been an adjustment for many couples, because the most time they spend together is usually on a vacation, not for this long. 
Sometimes, it's difficult to realize or admit that your main issue is wanting all the people around you to back off for a little while. Licensed clinical social worker Jessica Marie Ortiz, MSW, says these are common indications that you might need some solo time:
 
If you find yourself lacking in humor, feeling down or anxious, or getting upset over incidents that wouldn't have bothered you in the past, those may be good indications you need alone time.﻿﻿
 
The primary, and likely least comfortable, tactic for more alone time is to ask for it. Having this conversation can be challenging, especially if tensions in the household are already high. But consider this, suggests clinical psychologist Annie Varvaryan, PsyD: You might be the first to ask for alone time, but you're likely not the only one to need it.
 
""Acknowledge the current difficulties,"" she suggests. ""Talk about what things were like before and how they've changed. That can shine a light on the reality of the situation and how you need to adapt as a couple, as a family, and individually.""
 
She also suggests:
 
In addition to having ""the talk"" with your co-habitants, consider other alone-time approaches like:
 Making time for yourself and communicating your need for alone time will have real lasting benefits for your mental health and your relationships. Give these strategies a try and see what works for you. ""Once you get a few of these approaches in place, you'll find it isn't as daunting to make it happen,"" says Ortiz. ""It is a little easier to let go of the guilt or stress when we're recharged, and that makes it easier to ask for what we need, and give to others in turn."" Isolation and loneliness are causing health concerns right now, but those who have no alone time are struggling, too. Blurred work-life balance boundaries, increased child care, and more domestic duties can create stress within any family or relationship. There are productive ways to start a conversation about getting more alone time. Easily irritated Feeling stretched thin Physical problems related to chronic stress like insomnia, digestive issues, headaches Short-tempered Disinterest in activities, particularly with family or spouse Easily distracted or trouble with concentration Be concise in how you express your needs Be specific with what you need, like having a certain amount of time to read a book uninterrupted Be considerate of the needs of others and be willing to provide them with alone time as well Start small. Instead of aiming for 30 minutes or more from the beginning, set aside shorter, more manageable amounts of alone time, advises Ortiz. This can be just five minutes without helping or attending to anyone else, she says. Go outside. There has been ample research that just sitting outdoors, even in an urban setting,﻿﻿ can prompt feelings of wellness and lower levels of anxiety and stress.﻿﻿ Mead suggests you leave devices inside and simply sit with nature if possible, thinking of it as a break in every way rather than just a change of scenery. Mimic a workday environment. Working from home releases people from the commute, but it can also mean there's no endpoint besides bedtime. Creating better boundaries can help, says licensed clinical social worker Alyza Berman. She suggests getting dressed for work, kissing each other ""goodbye,"" and having a workspace that you leave at a certain time. Develop your own interests. Varvaryan says it's helpful to find an activity that's just yours, without your partner, kids, or other co-habitants. For example, you might workout on your own, watch a virtual concert, take up a hobby, or meditate. Get alone together. Carving out your own time doesn't necessarily mean you have to be alone, it just means you need a break from the people you're around every day. Varvaryan suggests scheduling an online ""coffee talk"" with a friend, or just chatting on the phone. But keep in mind that if this also makes you feel depleted, it may be better to go truly solo.",significant focus mental health covid center around impact isolation loneliness good reason numerous study show lack social interaction others lead depression possibly even shorten life side spectrum families use much togetherness adult kid may move back younger kid school work virtually still home instead summer camp work life boundaries essentially erase domestic duties battleground add tension matter situation certainly alone initially many families couple enjoy extra time together drag say psychotherapist carrie mead lcpc many able achieve healthy balance quiet independent self direct time still meet need partner children family members part difficulty misguide idea love someone choose spend time person say psychotherapist dana dorfman msw reason old say absence make heart grow fonder endure physical emotional separations boundaries essential healthy adult relationships say humans social creatures rely relationships connection emotional survival also need time alone think nourish care replenish individuality sometimes may difficult carve alone time part couple rather family might feel person even like rejection instead self care fuel feel stress see clients everyone feel smother overwhelm lack separation adjustment many couple time spend together usually vacation long sometimes difficult realize admit main issue want people around back little license clinical social worker jessica marie ortiz msw say common indications might need solo time find lack humor feel anxious get upset incidents bother past may good indications need alone time primary likely least comfortable tactic alone time ask conversation challenge especially tensions household already high consider suggest clinical psychologist annie varvaryan psyd might first ask alone time likely one need acknowledge current difficulties suggest talk things like change shine light reality situation need adapt couple family individually also suggest addition talk habitants consider alone time approach like make time communicate need alone time real last benefit mental health relationships give strategies try see work get approach place find daunt make happen say ortiz little easier let guilt stress recharge make easier ask need give others turn isolation loneliness cause health concern right alone time struggle blur work life balance boundaries increase child care domestic duties create stress within family relationship productive ways start conversation get alone time easily irritate feel stretch thin physical problems relate chronic stress like insomnia digestive issue headaches short temper disinterest activities particularly family spouse easily distract trouble concentration concise express need specific need like certain amount time read book uninterrupted considerate need others will provide alone time well start small instead aim minutes begin set aside shorter manageable amount alone time advise ortiz five minutes without help attend anyone else say outside ample research sit outdoors even urban set prompt feel wellness lower level anxiety stress mead suggest leave devices inside simply sit nature possible think break every way rather change scenery mimic workday environment work home release people commute also mean endpoint besides bedtime create better boundaries help say license clinical social worker alyza berman suggest get dress work kiss goodbye workspace leave certain time develop interest varvaryan say helpful find activity without partner kid habitants example might workout watch virtual concert take hobby meditate get alone together carve time necessarily mean alone mean need break people around every day varvaryan suggest schedule online coffee talk friend chat phone keep mind also make feel deplete may better truly solo

Adjusting to working from home, dealing with unemployment, or doing long shifts as a frontline worker. Spending a little too much time cooped up with family, or feeling isolated from being alone. Trying to manage homeschooling and childcare, or wondering when you'll be seeing the grandkids again.
 
Everyone's COVID-19 experience is unique in terms of work and home challenges, but one aspect of the pandemic seems to be fairly universal: People are struggling.
 
""We simply were not made to operate in this way, with so much uncertainty,"" says Cheryl Carmin, PhD, psychologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. ""The brain loves routine, knowing what's coming next, and familiarity. To be thrown into the opposite of that, so quickly, is understandably causing quite a lot of anxiety, fear, and stress.""
 
That reaction is so common that the Centers for Disease Control has a section on its Coronavirus page about the mental health effects of pandemics, including:﻿﻿
 But there is an upside, too. With so many people sharing a higher level of stress and overwhelm, there seems to be less stigma about mental health—and that may lead more people to seek help for mental health issues, Carmin says. 
""Stigma has been a huge barrier for many people, especially because some might think they'll be punished in by their employers or that they're weak for getting help,"" she adds. ""But it's very possible that greater acceptance of mental health care is part of the new normal.""
 
As individuals, families, companies, and insurers face a potentially different landscape with mental health due to COVID-19, it's likely the U.S. will take a deeper dive into how emotional issues are handled here compared to other countries, says Denise Rousseau, PhD, professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. That could have a profound impact on the way mental health treatment is handled here.
 
""In Europe, for example, mental health is seen as the responsibility of the community, and in Asia, it's seen as the responsibility of the family, but here it's viewed as a challenge for an individual,"" she says.
 
""Because of that, there may be less of a feeling of overall support, especially from an employer, as well as from friends and family members. Someone may think he or she will see pushback in the form of losing promotion opportunities, being seen as fragile, and losing the respect of people they love. That belief can be pervasive.""
 
Another challenge in the U.S. going into the pandemic, she adds, is that it's less acceptable to be sad here. There's a culture of positivity that can feel almost toxic to someone who is experiencing feelings that are normal in a pandemic, like grief, loss, pessimism, and irritation.
 Feeling down is part of life. It's not a problem to resolve aggressively, it's an acknowledgment that we can't be happy all the time. Mental health isn't about trying to get people to feel upbeat no matter what, it's about building resilience. As we all navigate through this together, that will hopefully become more prominent. 
As the stigma lifts and the culture changes, the sense of shared trauma and experiences are making it easier for people to talk not just about their own struggles, but to recognize those issues in others, believes Carmin.
 
""COVID-19 is prompting conversations that have been needed long before the pandemic hit,"" she says. ""We're talking about what employers should be doing, what public health officials should be doing, what role healthcare providers can play. We're talking about compassion fatigue, anxiety, depression, all those difficult topics. And that's good to get it all out in the open.""
 If you find yourself struggling with emotional and mental health challenges during this time of intense uncertainty and unrest, you're certainly not alone. Check with your health insurance provider for information on what type of mental health services might be covered—especially since that coverage may have expanded in the past few months. Also, ask your primary care physician or another healthcare provider for appropriate referrals. Often, you may be able to do telehealth sessions even as a new patient. Even if you're not ready to take the first step into getting mental health services, it can be helpful to know in advance what resources are available, and what coverage for them might be. But if you are having any thoughts of suicide, don't delay treatment. Help is available 24/7 at the National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255.

Social media has long been a breeding ground for public shaming and this pandemic is no different. People have politicized everything from stay-at-home orders to mask-wearing and have repeatedly taken to social media to shame one another for differing views. But now as the country begins to open up, the mask shaming has moved from social media to in-person confrontations.
 
There are those who maintain that wearing masks is infringing upon their civil liberties or that it's not an effective means for preventing the spread of COVID-19. And then there are those who believe masks are beneficial and stop the spread of the virus—and they want to be sure they are following the guidelines of their public health officials and government leaders.
 
Part of the shaming problem stems from the fact that early on in the pandemic, government officials were concerned about the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and advised Americans against buying or wearing masks. They even went so far as to say that masks weren’t effective at stopping the spread of COVID-19. 
 Of course, with additional research and studies, they have concluded the masks are in fact effective in slowing the spread.﻿﻿ 
Additionally, it's important to remember is that this is a novel coronavirus—meaning that this virus is so new that scientists, researchers, and public health officials are still learning about what works and what doesn’t not only in treating the virus but also in preventing the spread.
 
As a result, what these experts thought about masks two months ago has changed as more studies have been conducted. Consequently, it’s important to be flexible in allowing room for new discoveries and developments as experts learn more about how to effectively address this pandemic.
 
In early April, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Disease, and one of the nation’s top doctors leading the fight against the pandemic departed from the government’s original recommendation that you should only wear a mask if you were caring for someone with the illness or had it yourself. He changed his recommendations and indicated that if everyone wore a mask we'd be doing more to protect one another.﻿﻿ 
 
Not long after that, the Federal Government's coronavirus task force shared national recommendations for Americans to wear non-medical face masks. They also emphasized that the recommendation does not eliminate the need for social distancing. From there state and local governments began developing guidelines for how mask-wearing would be handled in their individual regions.
 
Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now encourages mask-wearing whenever you go out in public.﻿﻿ Apart from preventing obviously ill people from spreading the virus, these recommendations stem from the fact that many people who are in fact infected present as asymptomatic. Consequently, without a mask, they are highly likely to spread the virus to other people—perhaps even the most vulnerable among us without even knowing it. 
 By wearing a mask, they are significantly reducing the chances of spreading COVID-19 to others. Most scientists and medical professionals maintain that to slow the spread of the virus from person to person, it is best to wear a mask in public and maintain a six-foot distance between people. 
Today, both disease experts and governments that represent 95% of the world’s population agree with the science that cloth masks are shown to limit the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. What’s more, according to Masks4All, a non-profit devoted to compiling scientific evidence on mask-wearing, more than 100 countries and 14 U.S. states require mandatory mask-wearing.﻿﻿
 
Additionally, 28 more states have some, slightly more lenient requirements regarding wearing masks. Only eight states do not have any requirements when it comes to masks according to Masks4All. These states include Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Carolina, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota. 
 
Mental health professionals indicate that mask shaming has erupted during the pandemic primarily due to the lack of consistent rules, misinformation, and anxiety. This pandemic created a situation that no one could have anticipated, and people need consistent messages about what is expected and why.
 
Without a streamlined national policy on wearing masks, people are left to sift through information and draw their own conclusions. And, while the CDC and the Surgeon General both recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public, there is no official requirement to do so.
 
Instead, most states are making those decisions individually and sometimes inconsistently. This leads many people to gravitate toward information that reinforces their personal beliefs, regardless of whether that information is medically accurate or not. 
 
So if someone simply doesn't feel like wearing a mask, they might cite resources from earlier in the year that said wearing one won't make much of a difference. It's tough to effectively convince someone that they should be wearing a mask when there aren't enough definitive rules. This is where the shaming impulse comes into play.
 
Another motivating factor behind mask shaming is fear. When people are scared or uncertain, they sometimes respond in aggressive ways. It’s a self-defense mechanism that serves to squash their fear and allows them to hide behind a false sense of power.
 For people who are afraid of getting COVID-19, they may resort to shaming others online or in public in an attempt to get everyone to take precautions. And for people opposed to mask-wearing, they are shaming other people because of a fear of losing their freedoms or being controlled. 
Now that states are starting to open up their economies and their businesses, the culture war of wearing masks has left the digital realm and spilled over into parking lots and grocery store aisles. Many people are reporting hostile encounters with complete strangers over face coverings. And, it’s happening on both sides of the debate.
 
People who are wearing masks are being called fearful or told they are sheep for following the CDC’s guidelines. Meanwhile, people who are not wearing masks—because they choose not to, cannot afford one, or have a condition that prevents them from wearing one—are being insulted as well. They are being called everything from stupid and uneducated to conspiracy theorists and murderers.
 
To further complicate matters, businesses that require masks just like they require a shirt and shoes, are trying to enforce the new standards often without state backing or police support. As a result, their employees are the ones trying to enforce the new rules and are being ridiculed, assaulted, and sometimes even killed over mask-wearing.﻿﻿
 
And some businesses who have developed strong face mask rules are dealing with threats of being boycotted. For instance, the retail giant, Costco, has taken a hard-line and is requiring customers to wear face coverings at its stores nationwide regardless of each individual state’s requirements.
 
“We know some members may find this inconvenient or objectionable, but under the circumstances, we believe the added safety is worth the inconvenience,” Costco President Craig Jelinek said in a statement. “This is not simply a matter of personal choice; a face-covering protects not just the wearer, but others, too. In short, we believe this is the right thing to do under the current circumstances.”﻿﻿
 
Even though wearing masks in public is becoming commonplace in the United States, it’s still causing deep divisions among people. Yet, mental health experts like Amy Morin, a licensed psychotherapist and author of the New York Times best-selling book, 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do, say that shaming other people isn’t the right way to go about changing people’s opinions or their behaviors.
 “Shaming other people often doesn’t produce the results we want it to,” Morin says. In other words, shaming people through a social media post or shaming them in public is not going to produce change—a change comes from having a respectful dialogue. 
Likewise, Morin says that whether people are wearing a mask or not, it’s important to remember that unless you have a close relationship with the person, you don’t know their story. So, making assumptions about them—and shaming them—without knowing the full story is unfair.
 
For instance, Morin says some people may not be able to wear face coverings because of a mental health issue like having claustrophobia, a panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Even people who have had a traumatic experience like being abused or raped may have trouble covering their faces.
 
Likewise, people who are wearing masks should not be judged either. Aside from abiding by CDC guidelines, there could be any number of reasons why they may be wearing a mask. For instance, a college student may wear a mask in order to protect her elderly parents at home. Or, a mom could wear a mask in public because she has a son with cancer. 
 
Some people wear masks simply because their state or employer requires it and they feel it is the moral and responsible thing to do. Whatever the case, “Most people, if they knew the full story behind why someone is wearing a mask or not wearing a mask, would not be so quick to judge or to shame others,” Morin says.
 
Before mask-wearing became a recommendation—and a requirement in some states—people assumed that if someone was wearing a mask, that they were sick with COVID-19. Some of that questioning still lingers a little in the back of people's minds.
 
Additionally, some people are so sure that the coronavirus is not an issue, that they find it laughable that people are even bothering with masks. Consequently, they can be downright mean in response.
 
Morin suggests dealing with these people by ignoring their hurtful words and comments. ""It also might help to develop a mantra that you repeat to yourself anytime someone says something rude or insensitive. Then, remind yourself why you're wearing a mask,"" she says. ""You could even write it down and stick it in your pocket as a reminder.""
 You could also come up with a generic response that you repeat when people make a snide remark. ""Remember though, it's not your job to educate people,"" she says. ""Just go about your business and if you can move away from the person."" 
If the shaming occurs on social media, Morin suggests finding the mute button. ""It's OK to unfollow or unfriend people. You want to follow people that make you feel good about who you are.""
 
While it's never a good idea to engage aggressively with a complete stranger over a volatile topic, it is OK to defend yourself if someone infringes on your rights or puts you at risk.
 
For instance, if someone is not wearing a mask and is infringing on your personal space, it's perfectly acceptable to ask them to respect the six-foot guideline of social distancing. And, if you're not comfortable confronting them, remove yourself from the situation.
 
Regardless of where you stand on the mask-wearing debate, it’s important to remember that not only does the CDC recommend that people wear cloth face masks in public, but there is plenty of scientific evidence to support this recommendation. When you wear a mask, you are not only protecting yourself but more importantly, you are protecting others.
 
No matter where you stand on the mask-wearing debate, it’s important to follow the guidelines of the area in which you live. Likewise, be respectful of the businesses you frequent and abide by their guidelines. 
 
And remember, shaming others does nothing but hurt other people. In order to change someone’s opinion, you need to first have a relationship built on trust and the time to have a meaningful and respectful conversation. You are not going to change someone’s opinion with a social media post.

If you’re anxious, worried, or concerned about life after the coronavirus pandemic, you’re not alone. As we emerge from our homes to resume work, shopping, dining out, exercise, and daily life, many of us are scrutinizing routine decisions we once thought nothing of—not to mention, we’re also facing the reality that our health and financial well-being is much different now than it was going into quarantine. 
 
Plus, there is still a lot we don't know. Like how safe is it to resume daily life without a vaccine? And how should we feel about states being on different timelines? Even as things open up, there are still complicated feelings and thoughts about being around other people.
 
We talked with five mental health experts about the psychology of opening back up and how we can adapt to the new normal.
 
There’s no denying that COVID-19 has impacted our mental health. But now, as we begin the process of restarting our lives and the economy, many people are balancing the need to socialize and regain some kind of normalcy with the lingering dangers of being in crowded spaces and potentially risking exposure to the virus. Experts are calling this crossroads of emotions “re-entry anxiety.” 
 One of the top concerns is how to deal with the stress and anxiety that people around you might be infected or contagious, which also extends to feeling awkward when near strangers. 
To help ease some of this fear anxiety, the first thing experts recommend is that you only do what's comfortable for you and go at your own pace. 
 
“We have to think about this as a long-term strategy, over months or probably a year or so,” says Kevin Gilliland, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and the executive director of Innovation 360. Take your time through the process and don't let anyone make you feel like you have to be comfortable going back to normal right away.
 
Besides going at your own pace, a good place to start says Gilliland is to focus on the things you actually have control over,﻿﻿ like your behavior in relation to the virus, since it’s the best strategy when we have uncertainty. This includes being factual and specific with your thoughts because worry hates that. 
 We have no idea who is infected and who isn’t, so we still need to social distance, wash our hands frequently, sanitize surfaces at home and work regularly, and be mindful of how much and how many articles and news stories we are watching and reading. 
From there, we can continue to do things to maintain a strong immune system like being physically active, getting seven or eight hours of sleep, and connecting with two or three people that know you well. 
 
As for the need to socialize, Gilliland says we desperately need to get this back in our lives, but we need to be mindful of distance and touch. Start with a small circle of close friends and get together outside in a park or yard or trail. Walk and talk and share about life and be careful that it’s not all about this virus.
 
Also, be aware of the people you surround yourself with. Are there people you talk to that increase your anxiety or decrease your anxiety about this issue? “More is not always better when it comes to anxiety,” says Gilliland. 
 
For many people, walking around in a mask surrounded by others wearing masks provokes feelings of fear and uncertainty. 
 
“People feel anxiety and fear when wearing a mask or seeing others wear masks because it is a visual and constant reminder of the threat we are under,” says Moe Gelbart, PhD, director of practice development at Community Psychiatry. The mask symbolizes the virus which lurks out there and ignites fears of lack of control and of an unseen enemy.
 
Many people are also struggling with face coverings because they prevent us from seeing each other. “Seeing faces is a very important aspect of our socialization,” says Allie Shapiro, MD, a psychiatrist with Community Psychiatry. Not seeing faces, she says, removes that familiarity and connection. 
 
Wearing or seeing someone wear a mask reminds us of the greater issue, which, Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, Talkspace therapist says our minds often react to immediately. “We can go into fight or flight mode, and living in this constant state of hyper-arousal affects us physically, mentally, and emotionally,” she adds. To minimize the effects of this hyper-arousal, Catchings recommends the following strategies:
 
If you experience increased anxiety while walking around in a mask, Shapiro says to pause where you are and try taking a few deep breaths.﻿﻿ It’s also a good idea to remind yourself why you’ve gone outside and remember that you are doing the best you can to keep yourself safe.
 
Gelbart suggests that people remind themselves that things like handwashing, social distancing, and wearing a mask—all of which provide some measure of control and makes the unknowable known—reduces fear and anxiety. It’s also beneficial to remind yourself that wearing a mask is an act of kindness and care for others.
 
As different parts of the country open up at their own speed, Shapiro says it’s important to realize that acting, feeling, and being normal is going to look different now. Even in places that are now open, or were never closed, to begin with, things look and feel different. “Knowing you have full control to keep yourself safe, can make accepting the change easier,” she says. 
 
After all, it’s not the crowded space that is the source of danger, it’s the virus. “Wearing protective gear, like a mask, and staying vigilant, as we are now accustomed to doing, drastically reduces the risk of infection,” adds Shapiro.
 
Additionally, Dayry Hulkow, primary therapist at Arete Recovery, a Delphi Behavioral Health Group, recommends exercising prudence while tending to our emotional and social needs in a responsible manner. “We can evaluate the necessity or benefits compared to the risks associated with specific places and situations,” she says.
 
For example, the necessity for grocery shopping may take precedence for most of us despite the risks. Also, getting a hair cut or going to the gym may outweigh the risks for many of us, whereas other more crowded spaces may pose increased risks which, Hulkow says wouldn’t seem worth it for some of us regardless of the potential benefits. 
 
And Gelbart agrees. “Our behaviors are risk-reward based, and each of us has our own needs, and our own levels of risk we are willing to take and are justified in whatever our reaction and decision may be,” he says. We balance the need to get out with the fear we experience by how necessary the action is to us.
 
For example, going to a restaurant is really necessary for some, and for others, not important at all. He stresses the need to accept our own limits and boundaries and to resist the pressure of other people’s choices.
 
The news and social media paint a picture of people feeling pure joy and elation about being out of quarantine. But what if you have mixed emotions about re-entry? Is it normal to still feel scared? 
 
Yes, says Hulkow. “After all we’ve seen in the news during the pandemic and experienced in real life, feeling scared, stressed, and anxious is 100 percent valid,” she explains. That said, Hulkow does stress the importance of working through these feelings and exploring ways of coping. 
 
For some people, particularly those within vulnerable populations, continuing to stay home may be preferable for the time being. However, Hulkow points out that staying home solely out of fear may keep other people from living life in general, whether outside or inside the home. “While it may feel awkward or uncomfortable at first to venture out, it is possible for most of us to safely return to some sort of “normal” within a reasonable time.
 It’s not only normal to feel scared but very appropriate. The more unknown something is, the less control we feel we have, and the more our feelings of anxiety and fear are spiked. 
That’s why Gelbart says it’s important to know that we can listen to our feelings of fear, or we can act differently despite them. But most importantly, he says, we need to acknowledge and validate the feelings we experience as normal.
 
“It’s not unusual for some people to continue to be worried or avoid moving back into life,” says Gilliland. However, he does stress the need to be careful and not to allow worry to spill over into anxiety and fear, or our life may become very limited. And again, be factual.
 
“Isolation is not good for humans, even when it’s the right thing medically. If we disconnect from others and from things that are beneficial in our life, our levels of anxiety, depression, and substance use increase,” says Gilliland. 
 No one has ever been through anything like this in the modern world, so no one really knows how to do it “right.” Even the experts don’t have all the answers, so it’s normal to have your own uncertainties and doubts.  WHO Criteria for Lifting Coronavirus Restrictions (Yale Global) CDC Activities and Initiatives Supporting the COVID-19 Response (CDC) As the economy reopens and states begin lifting stay-at-home orders, we need to mentally prepare for a new normal. Practice caution when adding socialization and other pre-COVID-19 behaviors back into your life. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help if the stress of reopening is negatively affecting your mental health. Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or meditation Stick to regular bedtime and waking times Exercise during the day Don’t be afraid to use crying as a release since it may help to cope with anger

As we reach the two-month mark of social distancing and various stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, many people are feeling physically and emotionally drained from what experts have labeled “quarantine fatigue.”
 
And even though the majority of people recognize the importance of staying indoors, honoring the healthcare workers, and following the recommendations from the CDC or local government, experts are beginning to see some areas where people are pushing the limits and returning to their pre-pandemic ways. 
 
If comparing this experience to a marathon, you could easily say that many of us have “hit the wall.” To cope with this, some people are becoming more relaxed about social distancing and spending more time outdoors or seeing loved ones by socializing “safely,” which may feel problematic at times. 
 
And while some states are slowly entering phase one of reopening, we are nowhere near a “normal” routine. In fact, many experts say that we will never return to a way of life that was exactly as it was before. That’s why now, more than ever, we need to stay the course and fight the urge to loosen up on safety measures that are in place to protect us all.
 
With that in mind, a lot of people are wondering how they can reboot and find new ways to cope with quarantine fatigue. But before we explore actionable solutions to address quarantine fatigue, we need to understand what it is and why it’s affecting us. 
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
When COVID-19 first appeared, we were focused on staying safe and alive. And now that we’re in the next phase of feeling like there is no end in sight, the focus may seem unclear. So, what shifted for so many people?
 
According to Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, for many weeks, people launched themselves head-first into panic mode, making giant changes to their lives with the idea of staying alive. “As terrifying as it has all been for many, these were actionable plans that an individual could take, with a goal in mind, and witness actual change and feel that they accomplished something,” she says.
 Now that we have adjusted our lifestyles and implemented protective measures, the immediate terror and urgency of the task are beginning to recede. The actual numbers and the real science are no less concerning, but because we have done some accommodating psychologically to the fear we stop feeling it as intensely. 
What that leaves us with is a growing sense of non-productivity, repetitiveness, loss of many things of our old life plus the loss of excitement and newness in our day. 
 
We also miss and crave contact with other people, especially since we are social creatures. While a few weeks of separation may have felt tolerable (possibly even a welcome change), psychotherapist, Dana Dorfman, PhD, says social urges and needs are intensifying and we're craving more human connection. 
 
She also points out that this crisis mode that many of us are operating in is difficult to sustain. “As people’s awareness heightened about the virus, we went into crisis mode, developing a sense of urgency, anxiety, and quick decision making,” she says. However, Dorfman says this physiological state is not sustainable, and eventually, the dust settles, the mind acclimates, and reality sets in—hence, quarantine fatigue.
 
We all experience quarantine fatigue differently, but one thing’s for sure, having healthy ways to cope is critical for our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. With that in mind, here are seven expert tips on how to deal with quarantine fatigue. 
 
The first step towards healing, says psychotherapist, Daryl Appleton, LMHC, EDD, is to understand and acknowledge the difference between wants and needs.
 
“We need to make sure that our basic needs such as food, water, shelter, exercise, safety, and support are being met before we move to the things we want to do,” says Appleton. “Having a strong foundation rooted in needs can make all the difference in fighting quarantine fatigue,” she adds.
 
If you’re struggling with meeting your basic needs, reach out for help. Call a friend or family member. Ask a neighbor for help. Contact your doctor. If you are alone and not sure how to find help, call a hotline for support and guidance. Many of them are staffed 24 hours a day. 
 
Once your foundational needs are met, begin to explore your wants. Appleton says to ask yourself: “What would I like to accomplish?” Are there podcasts or books you’d like to flex your intellectual muscles on or different skill sets you would like to cultivate. “Begin to make intentional space for growth in quarantine to help break up the monotony of everyday life—once you are ready for it,” says Appleton.
 Just remember, there is no time table or competition to get this done, and some days, it’s just about surviving. That’s why Appleton reminds us “to be kind with yourself as you manage through a time that has no guidebook.”  
While this tip may seem obvious, we can all use a gentle reminder that sticking to a routine is important when life is uncertain. Dr. Alexa Mieses, MD, a family physician, says going to sleep and waking at the same hour each day, eating nutritious food, and incorporating physical activity are all healthy ways to fight quarantine fatigue.
 
When weather permits, getting outdoors to get some sunlight, while still practicing social distancing, can help boost your mood. She also recommends a daily practice of mindfulness with a focus on being present in the moment. “By honing your coping skills, you’re also preparing for what’s on the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Mieses.
 
In our efforts to cope, Dorfman says we may push aside, minimize, or ignore our frustration, sadness, and powerlessness.
 In order to harness these feelings and direct them in productive and adaptive ways, we must acknowledge them to ourselves. Not only can this provide relief, but it also reduces the power these feelings may have over you. 
Once you acknowledge, validate, and accept these feelings, consider sharing with a friend, partner, or professional. This is also an excellent time to practice journaling. Aim to write in a journal daily. Then, at the end of the week, take 15 to 20 minutes to read each entry. 
 
When you set small, manageable goals, you can benefit from short-term rewards, which may help us deal with so many unknowns. “The uncertainty of the situation is anxiety-producing and emotionally taxing and may result in a cumulative feeling of powerlessness and being out of control,” says Dorfman. 
 
Her suggestion? Identify something within your control that provides an immediate sense of accomplishment and purpose. Try a new recipe, clean out a closet, or organize your spice drawer—choose a small manageable goal that has a quick result. “This immediate sense of accomplishment may offset the larger challenges,” she adds. 
 
We all have our “go-to” forms of self-care that are easy to access and typically results in a feeling of satisfaction. But with extra time, and more unstructured time, and an emphasis on health, Dorfman says this may be an ideal time to experiment with different forms of caring for yourself.
 Consider trying mindfulness meditation, yoga, taking a bath, journaling—all the many activities you've read about, and considered, but could not find the time to begin. 
With the hustle and bustle of life, many people feel they don’t have time for therapy. But Saltz says right now, a lot of us actually do have time for therapy. If in-office visits are not available, consider teletherapy. Many therapists have transitioned to an online or telephone platform that allows patients to access services from their homes. Plus, many therapists are even volunteering their time to help others. “This is a very good time to understand your own unresolved issues, to understand yourself more deeply, and to grow as a person,” she says.
 Patience, vigilance, understanding, and acceptance are key to managing quarantine fatigue. While you may, at times, feel the urge to take a break from social distancing, staying the course is what will help us all get through the coming months and years. Try to think of your day in 24-hour increments, which allows you to take things one day at a time, look for ways to create newness in your day, or find opportunities to experience any small sense of accomplishment. But most importantly, be kind to yourself and recognize that you are not alone. If you are feeling overwhelmed or experiencing severe mood swings, consider seeking professional help. Talk to your doctor for a recommendation to a mental health expert, or, if you’re currently in therapy, reach out to your therapist for help.  Managing Coronavirus Anxiety Coping With Coronavirus If You Live Alone Helping Kids Cope With Missed Activities (From Verywell Family) Creative Alternatives to Fitness Routines (From Verywell Fit) When Will COVID-19 End?

Long after someone has healed physically from COVID-19, they may still very well have some emotional wounds to address. After all, being diagnosed with COVID-19 can take a serious toll on an individual’s psychological well-being.
 The fear of dying, the social isolation experienced by those who are sick, and the anxiety related to the thought of getting sick again are just a few reasons why someone may experience a decline in mental health after contracting the coronavirus. 
Although it is too soon to understand the long-term psychological impact on individuals who test positive for COVID-19, there is some data that indicates that they may be at a higher risk for mental health issues, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).﻿﻿
 
Individuals may develop PTSD following a traumatic event (such as a natural disaster, a serious car accident, or a violent personal assault).
 
Symptoms may include:﻿﻿
 
Individuals who survive a life-threatening illness (such as COVID-19) may be at a high risk of developing PTSD. Whether they were near death, or they were isolated from all human contact (other than a few healthcare workers), the distress from the experience may lead to PTSD in some individuals.
 
Researchers in China have released some early research on what they have discovered so far. The researchers requested that patients who were discharged from quarantine facilities (temporary hospitals built to hold, quarantine, and treat people who tested positive) complete questionnaires about their psychological well-being.﻿﻿
 
They administered the PTSD checklist to 714 people and found that a staggering 96.2% of participants experienced symptoms of PTSD. They also found that these individuals experienced symptoms prior to being released from quarantine.
 
Some of the conditions and factors they experienced that may have affected their mental health included:
 
These factors caused most individuals to experience emotional disturbances including:
 There has not been any research published about individuals who have had the virus but were not hospitalized, but it is quite possible that even individuals who were quarantined in their own homes (or those who were fairly asymptomatic) may still be at a higher risk for PTSD. 
It’s not surprising that individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are at risk of developing PTSD. Research from other pandemics has revealed similar results.
 
Studies on individuals who were diagnosed with SARS revealed that survivors were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Individuals who tested positive for SARS were quarantined (just like in the case of COVID-19). And social isolation seemed to be a major factor in their mental health symptoms.
 
A 2004 study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases examined the psychological effects of individuals who were quarantined in Toronto, Canada, during the SARS outbreak. Researchers discovered that 29% of individuals exhibited PTSD and that 31% exhibited symptoms of depression.﻿﻿
 They found that longer durations of quarantine were associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Individuals who were exposed to someone who had been diagnosed with SARS were also at a higher risk for depression and PTSD. 
Studies show that children may also be at a higher risk of PTSD during and after a pandemic. A 2013 study examined the impact quarantine had on the mental health of children and their parents. Researchers discovered that the criteria for PTSD were met in 30% of isolated or quarantined children and about 25% of the parents.﻿﻿
 
The good news is that many of them experienced relief from their symptoms soon after they recovered. A 2005 study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases found “a significant decrease in symptom severity from 1 month to 3 months after discharge.”﻿﻿
 
Fortunately, PTSD is treatable.﻿﻿ Primary treatment usually involves psychotherapy. Therapy can help people make sense of their experience and gain better control over their symptoms.
 
There are several types of therapy that may be effective in treating individuals with PTSD related to COVID-19:
 
In some cases, medication may also be used in conjunction with talk therapy. There is not a specific medication that resolves PTSD, but there are medications that can curb some of the symptoms.
 
Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are commonly prescribed to individuals with PTSD. Prazosin may also be prescribed to reduce nightmares.﻿﻿
 
Many therapists and psychiatrists are offering online treatment—especially during this pandemic. So individuals who are at risk of developing PTSD (or those who think they may have symptoms) don’t have to wait until social distancing regulations are relaxed. It is possible to receive talk therapy or get a prescription from an online provider.
 Not everyone who has COVID-19 or has a loved one with the virus will develop PTSD. Those who do develop it are not necessarily weak or flawed; there are many factors that influence whether someone develops the condition. If you had COVID-19 and you have struggled with the stress it has caused, do not be afraid to reach out and ask for help. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner you can work on finding relief from your symptoms and improving your psychological well-being. Studies have observed symptoms of PTSD in people who were quarantined with COVID-19. Social isolation appears to be a leading factor. Children might be at a higher risk for PTSD whether or not they were infected with COVID-19. Nightmares Flashbacks Disturbing thoughts and feelings related to the event Sadness Fear Anger Feelings of detachment or estrangement Avoidance of anything that stirs up memories of the traumatic event Social isolation Perceived danger Uncertainty Physical discomfort Medication side effects Fear of transmitting the virus to others Negative news stories about the pandemic Loneliness Anger Anxiety Depression Insomnia Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy helps individuals face the situations and memories that they find disturbing—and therefore try to avoid. It can be particularly effective for individuals who experience flashbacks and nightmares. Some therapists use virtual reality programs to allow patients to safely re-enter the environment in which they experienced the trauma. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR combines exposure therapy with guided eye movements to help individuals process traumatic memories and change their reactions to them.﻿﻿ Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps individuals recognize and replace thoughts and behaviors that keep them stuck. It may be used in conjunction with exposure therapy.",long someone heal physically covid may still well emotional wound address diagnose covid take serious toll individual psychological well fear die social isolation experience sick anxiety relate think get sick reason someone may experience decline mental health contract coronavirus although soon understand long term psychological impact individuals test positive covid data indicate may higher risk mental health issue especially post traumatic stress disorder ptsd individuals may develop ptsd follow traumatic event natural disaster serious car accident violent personal assault symptoms may include individuals survive life threaten illness covid may high risk develop ptsd whether near death isolate human contact healthcare workers distress experience may lead ptsd individuals researchers china release early research discover far researchers request patients discharge quarantine facilities temporary hospitals build hold quarantine treat people test positive complete questionnaires psychological well administer ptsd checklist people find stagger participants experience symptoms ptsd also find individuals experience symptoms prior release quarantine condition factor experience may affect mental health include factor cause individuals experience emotional disturbances include research publish individuals virus hospitalize quite possible even individuals quarantine home fairly asymptomatic may still higher risk ptsd surprise individuals diagnose covid risk develop ptsd research pandemics reveal similar result study individuals diagnose sars reveal survivors likely experience depression anxiety ptsd individuals test positive sars quarantine like case covid social isolation seem major factor mental health symptoms study publish emerge infectious diseases examine psychological effect individuals quarantine toronto canada sars outbreak researchers discover individuals exhibit ptsd exhibit symptoms depression find longer durations quarantine associate increase prevalence ptsd symptoms individuals expose someone diagnose sars also higher risk depression ptsd study show children may also higher risk ptsd pandemic study examine impact quarantine mental health children parent researchers discover criteria ptsd meet isolate quarantine children parent good news many experience relief symptoms soon recover study publish emerge infectious diseases find significant decrease symptom severity month months discharge fortunately ptsd treatable primary treatment usually involve psychotherapy therapy help people make sense experience gain better control symptoms several type therapy may effective treat individuals ptsd relate covid case medication may also use conjunction talk therapy specific medication resolve ptsd medications curb symptoms antidepressants anti anxiety medications commonly prescribe individuals ptsd prazosin may also prescribe reduce nightmares many therapists psychiatrists offer online treatment especially pandemic individuals risk develop ptsd think may symptoms wait social distance regulations relax possible receive talk therapy get prescription online provider everyone covid love one virus develop ptsd develop necessarily weak flaw many factor influence whether someone develop condition covid struggle stress cause afraid reach ask help sooner seek treatment sooner work find relief symptoms improve psychological well study observe symptoms ptsd people quarantine covid social isolation appear lead factor children might higher risk ptsd whether infect covid nightmares flashbacks disturb thoughts feel relate event sadness fear anger feel detachment estrangement avoidance anything stir memories traumatic event social isolation perceive danger uncertainty physical discomfort medication side effect fear transmit virus others negative news stories pandemic loneliness anger anxiety depression insomnia exposure therapy exposure therapy help individuals face situations memories find disturb therefore try avoid particularly effective individuals experience flashbacks nightmares therapists use virtual reality program allow patients safely enter environment experience trauma eye movement desensitization reprocess emdr emdr combine exposure therapy guide eye movements help individuals process traumatic memories change reactions cognitive behavioral therapy cbt cbt help individuals recognize replace thoughts behaviors keep stick may use conjunction exposure therapy

Whether you’re stressed about your financial situation, or you’re struggling to help your kids do their school work from home, the coronavirus outbreak has likely caused some sort of upheaval in your life.
 
If you’re not careful, the stress of the situation can take a serious toll on your psychological well-being.
 
We interviewed several mental health experts from across the United States and asked them to weigh in on the trends they’re seeing and to find out how the pandemic is affecting their own mental health. Here’s what they had to say:
 
""I really do worry about the long-term ripple effects of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and relationship violence. All of these tend to trend upward when we have economic upheaval and increased unemployment, not to mention the trauma that comes with widespread loss and the threat of illness.
 
""This time around, we are dealing with a crisis whose very nature demands that we go without the usual coping mechanisms that can help us heal, such as gathering with our friends and extended families and becoming more interdependent within our neighborhoods and communities.""
 
—Andrea Bonior, licensed clinical psychologist and author of Detox Your Thoughts
 
""I am most concerned about the rising depression levels of people I'm seeing from being in long-term isolation. We need to be isolated for the sake of physical health and stopping the spread of the virus.
 
""However, people who were already struggling with being estranged from family members, struggling with co-parenting, or living with difficult family members are seeing their problems intensify.
 
""Not only are these problems intensifying, but the regular stress relievers that people are used to, such as going to the gym, nightlife, and even AA and NA meetings, are no longer available.
 Depression and anxiety can act like barometers that tell us something is not right here. So naturally, when we experience problems intensify without the relievers we are used to, we will experience an increase in anxiety and depression. We are grieving that life is not the same as it used to be. 
Deeper depression symptoms have set in a bit heavier now that the adrenaline rush of the initial quarantine phase has worn off and the fear that normal life may not return as quickly as we hoped has set in.""
 
—Mary Tatum, licensed mental health counselor
 
""We knew that all was not right with our kids prior to the corona pandemic: they were recognized as the most stressed, lonely, and risk-averse of any previous American generation. Teen anxiety, depression, and suicide rates were rising in an unprecedented fashion and had begun affecting younger kids as well. And then a pandemic hit.
 
""Research is clear: prolonged adversity always exacerbates preexisting mental health issues. Our kids are facing issues that rock their foundations. They tell me they worry about their family members’ health, their parents’ economic well-being, as well as their futures (college scholarships, personal safety about leaving home). Once those school doors reopen, our stressed-out generation will be even more anxious, lonely, and depressed.""
 
—Michele Borba, educational psychologist and author of UnSelfie: Why Empathetic Kids Succeed in Our All-About-Me World
 
""As I look forward, I’m more concerned about adults than children. I’m not suggesting that kids aren’t suffering or that they won’t face challenges on the other side of the pandemic, but I suspect they’ll be more resilient. Right now, their caretakers and educators are in survival mode.
 
""Many are numb and not particularly tapped into their interior lives. But when the immediate threat passes, I think many will fall apart. People are walking around with so much stress, from concerns about health to finances to balancing competing work and home demands.
 
""They’re worrying about ailing parents and strained marriages and failing businesses and their kids’ education and social-emotional well-being. It’s just a lot. And everyone from parents to teachers has been telling me they feel like they’re failing at everything.
 I won’t be surprised if we see an uptick in depression and anxiety among adults. Of course, even the most resilient child will be negatively impacted if their parent isn’t doing well. It’s all interrelated. 
""And I suspect that even after social distancing policies are loosened, there will be parents who are too fearful to let their kids go to a public park or birthday party or even return to school.
 
""As a result, I won’t be surprised if I see an uptick in issues such as separation anxiety, school refusal, or obsessive-compulsive and perfectionist tendencies. Kids who currently feel no sense of control over their destiny might over-compensate when schools reopen.""
 
—Phyllis Fagell, psychotherapist, school counselor, and author of Middle School Matters
 
""My husband told me yesterday that three friends of his friends (all entrepreneurs) have died by suicide in the last few weeks. There’s a palpable hopelessness that many people are feeling as the value and revenue that they derive from being a working member of society has become compromised. Without a known end, many don’t see a way out of the hole they are in.
 
""Elderly people and people living alone have to cope with loneliness on several accounts. They aren’t able to be with someone in their physical space, and they also don’t experience physical touch—a hug from a grandchild, someone holding their hand, etc.
 
""For kids, there’s also a problem with ends and beginnings. As a parent of a 5th grader, where a full month of celebrations and end-of-elementary school markers are typical, we are now seeing the cancellation or a reconfiguration of these anticipated milestones.
 
""With two nieces who are in 12th grade, we are seeing the lack of needed endings as well—where the return to in-person school is unlikely, and 13 years of school just sort of “fade out” instead of ending with a bang.
 These same kids, on the cusp of college, are wondering what life will look like for them in the fall. College is not just about the classes. But for many, it’s the beginning of more independence and adulthood. 
""Thousands of kids have been anticipating living in a dorm away from the nest they’ve been in for the last 18 years. For many, this is a rite of passage. Can you imagine how it must feel to prepare to spread your wings and then have them clipped right before you are about to fly?
 
""Interestingly, when it comes to anxiety, I’m starting to hear a buzz of children who have gotten so comfortable with online learning and being with family 24/7 that they would prefer not to go back to school. There is no drama, no distractions, no strict schedule, etc.
 
""The anxiety of returning and giving up this relaxed feel of virtual schooling, coupled with the probability of new pandemic-related rules (masks in classrooms, stricter hygiene, and social distancing in schools), will likely trigger anxiety in many children.""
 
—Robyn Silverman, PhD, host of How to Talk to Kids About Anything
 
""I am most concerned about a few issues:
 
—Uma Naidoo, MD, director of nutritional & lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School faculty member, and author of This Is Your Brain On Food
 
""For some people, this has made them reevaluate their priorities and reminded them of what their truest values are—how they most want to spend their time, what people they value most in their lives, and how much as a society we are all interconnected.
 
""I think it can lead to a larger dialogue about how crucial social connections are for mental health and about how loneliness seriously needs to be addressed.""
 
—Andrea Bonior, PhD
 
""The good news is that there is still a lot we can do even in a time of perceived helplessness and loss of control. Positive psychology specifically looks at how we can focus solely on the things we can control and how to maximize even the smallest victories.
 
""A unique aspect of this pandemic is it gives every human the opportunity to be a hero even if only in small ways. For example, we can help keep ourselves and others safe by cleaning, wearing masks, and practicing social distancing.
 Positive psychology research has shown that the positive feelings of altruism last much longer than the feelings derived from doing something pleasant or fun. In other words, altruism will lift your mood better and longer than seeking only pleasant mental distractions such as watching TV. 
""I have clients who are managing their time and anxieties by knitting, crocheting, or crafting various gifts to send to nursing homes and hospital staff. There are so many simple ways that we can show empathy, compassion, and kindness right now.
 
—Mary Tatum, LMHC
 
""My hope is that parents and educators use this crisis as a watershed moment and recognize that children's mental health is in jeopardy and must be prioritized because we all are dealing with stress, mental health may finally be more destigmatized.
 
""I’m crossing my fingers (and toes) that we finally have a collective “aha moment” and realize that grades and scores are not the magic sauce for success. Raising resilient, mentally healthy kids must become a top parenting priority so they are prepared for an uncertain world both now and later.""
 
—Michele Borba, EdD
 
""I keep reminding parents that there’s no right way to parent during a pandemic, as none of us have done this before. The same, by the way, is true for educators who also may be more likely than their students to collapse when things are a bit more normal.
 
""But here’s the silver lining. Research shows that having to endure forced periods of uncertainty can lead to greater satisfaction, gratitude, and flexibility later in life. Parents should take the pressure off of themselves to be home-schooling multitaskers, and focus instead on simply helping their child feel safe and loved.""
 
—Phyllis Fagell, LCPC
 
""When I speak with my girlfriends, we are all admitting to stress, sadness, and frustration. We are all nodding our heads “yes” and supporting each other with understanding; “Yes, I feel that too. It makes sense to feel like that.”
 Of course, we will always have the parents who look like they have everything together, but I think people are letting their freak flag fly a bit more lately. It's not perfect—and that's OK. 
""When I was little, my grandmother and I were stopped in front of the supermarket as the news was interviewing people on where they were when JFK was shot. While that was a single moment, it was a shared experience. I think of this pandemic like that—a shared experience brings people together.""
 
—Robyn Silverman, PhD
 
""Some positives include the number of resources being openly shared in the media to support people. Celebrities are sharing their history and online resources (e.g. Micheal Phelps). This has helped to reduce the stigma around mental health.
 
""First-line responders (doctors/nurses/EMTs/hospital staff) are addressing their emotions and sharing this with the public. Difficult emotions are being both acknowledged and “normalized” by them being open—whereas such emotions may usually be shared “only” with a psychiatrist or therapist.
 
""There is a focus on resilience, how we can overcome this, and how we can become stronger.""
 
—Uma Naidoo, MD
 
""I am struggling most with trying to balance all the needs that have arisen simultaneously. As a parent, I am six weeks into juggling working from home with three children underfoot with various schooling needs of their own. As a professor, I’ve had to scramble to transfer my classes online and meet the needs of a diverse set of students with challenges of their own.
 
""And as a therapist, I’ve had to make sure I am maintaining my own emotional balance so I can be fully present with my clients in their heightened sense of anxiety. It makes me prioritize trying to practice what I preach in terms of taking care of myself.""
 
—Andrea Bonior, PhD
 I try to take one day at a time and focus on what I can control while being extra mindful about the small victories of the day. 
""Both panic and calmness are contagious. Personally, I feel more anxious when I am around highly anxious people. I try to manage my own anxieties by keeping my mind on uplifting truths and stories of courageous people rather than allowing my brain to hyper-focus on the ""what-ifs"" of the uncertain future.""
 
—Mary Tatum, LMHC
 
""I had my own “aha moment” that the steady onslaught of hearing dismal news affects my attitude. Turning off the news channel and listening instead to my music playlist has done wonders.""
 
—Michele Borba, EdD
 
""I feel like I’m managing all the upheaval and disruption fairly well. But even so, my mind is perpetually foggy, the days have started to bleed together, and I’m worrying a great deal more than usual—about my parents, my children, my students, the general state of the world, and the list goes on.
 
""The good news is that I suspect people will emerge from the pandemic with more empathy. It’s an extreme situation, but it could end up normalizing that everyone loses their footing at times.""
 
—Phyllis Fagell, LCPC
 
""For me, I miss being with friends—as it’s not quite the same on Zoom (especially for a hugger like me). I also miss the freedom of being able to go shopping without having to worry, travel with family, and have alone time when it’s needed.
 
""I worry about my Mom—who is 75 but couldn’t be happier that she is at least in a 55 and older community where her friends are around (even if they are 6 feet apart). My family is figuring it out—we are finding pockets of time to be together and moments to be alone.
 
""My kids have become even tighter—as they are each other’s sole playmates right now! That warms my heart. But I had this epiphany in the middle of the night last night. I realized that in my quest to have some alone time in a home where there are always people, I wasn’t hugging my family as much as I typically did! We all know how important it is to hug people—for their sense of security, to know they are loved, and for their health!""
 
—Robyn Silverman, PhD
 
""It has not been easy! I had little time to “get things together” as my patients need me (meaning setting up virtual visits and restructuring how I do my work).
 I had to program 'self-care' into my daily activities much more actively so that I do not burn out myself. I practice compassion toward myself as I am not perfect. 
""I am paying attention to how and what I eat more than ever. This is a good live experiment of my work in nutritional psychiatry!""
 
—Uma Naidoo, MD
 It’s important to monitor your mental health and to help those around you who may be struggling. If you’re struggling to manage your stress, then get professional help. You might contact your doctor or reach out to an online therapist for support. A mental health professional can assist you in finding ways to manage the distress you feel in a healthy way, 
If you suspect someone around you is experiencing anxiety, depression, or another mental health problem, then talk about it. Ask that person how they’re managing stress, and talk about any struggles you’ve experienced as well. Provide them with resources that can help too. They may be more willing to seek professional help if you can give them information about how to do so.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to some major shifts in the way society functions. And many of these shifts may increase the risk of suicide in some individuals.
 
Current studies show that many Americans are experiencing increased distress right now from the pandemic. A McKinsey national consumer survey conducted from March 27 to March 29, 2020, found that 63% of Americans felt anxious, depressed, or a combination of both. And 80% of Americans reported feeling moderate or high distress. Additionally, 1 in 4 Americans reported binge drinking within the last week.﻿﻿
 
There are several factors related to the pandemic that may place some individuals at an especially high risk of suicide.
 
While social distancing is an important part of managing the spread of COVID-19, it can take a serious toll on some individuals’ mental health. And for those who have thoughts about killing themselves, fewer social interactions may greatly increase the risk of suicidal behavior.
 A 2018 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that social isolation and loneliness were key factors contributing to suicidal thoughts and behavior. ﻿﻿ 
Thus, individuals who live alone may be at an especially high risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior when they’re social distancing or quarantined. In addition, anyone else who experiences greater amounts of loneliness during the pandemic may be at a higher risk as well.
 
Shelter-in-place rules have caused many people to lose their jobs. These individuals are likely struggling right now to get unemployment or to find alternative sources of income. Their financial distress may place them at a higher risk of suicide. 
 
Additionally, there are concerns that a recession could be on the horizon. Many individuals have already lost money in the stock market, and many businesses may fail to recover even when shelter-in-place orders are lifted. 
 
Historically, economic downturns are associated with higher suicide rates. A 2015 study found that suicide rates tended to increase during recessions.﻿﻿
 
Many individuals rely on collective support from the community to function at their best. But nearly all community activities and programs have been canceled. 
 
In addition, most religious services have canceled all in-person events. For many people, attending religious services is key to maintaining good mental health. 
 
A 2016 study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that weekly attendance at a religious service was associated with a fivefold lower suicide rate. Without access to church services and community activities, people may feel more isolated than ever, which may greatly increase their risk of suicide.﻿﻿
 
Many mental health treatment centers are not seeing patients in person during the pandemic. And while some treatment providers have shifted to online and phone treatment, others may not be offering services at all.
 
Support groups, outpatient centers, and many day programs have suspended their services during the pandemic. This includes groups for substance abuse treatment as well, like Alcoholics Anonymous.
 
It may also be more difficult for individuals to see their physicians or psychiatrists. This may make it difficult to get prescriptions refilled.
 
Constant news coverage about the pandemic may have a negative toll on an individual’s well-being. Reports about “death tolls” and “community spread” can cause an immediate spike in anxiety. 
 
The distressing news may increase the severity of preexisting mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety. It may also increase substance use.﻿﻿
 
Studies have found physicians are at a high risk of suicide in general—especially female physicians. Their job-related stress may increase their risk for a variety of mental health issues.
 In fact, medical professionals may be at an especially high risk of suicide during the pandemic.﻿﻿ A lack of personal protective equipment, seeing colleagues get sick, and the fear of contracting the virus are just a few factors that can take a serious toll on well-being. 
But it’s not just physicians who feel the strain. A study on healthcare workers in Wuhan, China found that nurses and other frontline workers were more likely to experience psychological distress, including anxiety and depression, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
If you’re concerned about a friend or family member, reach out to them. Ask them how they’re doing. Be sure to acknowledge what a stressful time this is, and encourage them to share how they're handling the emotions caused by the current situation.
 
If you suspect they’re having thoughts of suicide, don’t hesitate to ask. Be direct with your questions by asking something like, “Have you had any thoughts about hurting yourself?” or “Have you thought about ending your life?”
 If there’s an imminent risk of suicide, call 911 or your local police department. Imminent risk may mean the individual has the intention of following through with a plan or has already engaged in suicidal behavior, such as taking pills. 
If the danger isn’t imminent, encourage the person to get help from a mental health professional. Make it clear that they deserve to feel better and you’re willing to guide them towards getting the help they need.
 
If you have questions about how to proceed or what to do, contact a suicide prevention or crisis line to talk about the situation.
 
If you’re concerned about a loved one’s well-being, it’s important to also take care of yourself. You might see a therapist on your own or you might reach out to someone you trust to help you work through the emotions you’re dealing with.
 
If you are having thoughts of suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. It’s free, confidential, and available 24/7 for anyone experiencing emotional distress. 
 
You can also contact the crisis text line. Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a trained crisis counselor via text message. Anyone in the US and Canada can get free support 24/7.
 
Calling your primary care physician or your local emergency room is always an option.
 It’s important to seek professional help if you’re having thoughts of killing yourself. And if you suspect a loved one may be suicidal, it’s important to support their efforts in getting help. Talk therapy, medication, or a combination of services have been shown to help. Hospitalization may be necessary in an acute crisis.

"
Some people love to have a solid daily routine, while others shudder at the thought of having a predictable schedule. During times of great stress, however, maintaining structure and routine can help you feel more organized and in control.
 
Having a routine can be helpful at any time, particularly if you are trying to establish healthy habits, but these routines can be particularly important when aspects of your life feel uncertain. 
 
The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically altered many people’s normal routines, which makes it that much harder to cope with the stress that people are feeling. 
 
Many people are either working from home or faced with the prospect of an unknown period of unemployment. Those working at home may quickly discover that the constant isolation and lack of a normal schedule can be mentally taxing. 
 When people don't have a routine or structure to their day it can cause increased stress and anxiety, as well as overwhelming feelings, lack of concentration, and focus. 
A lack of structure and routine can actually exacerbate feelings of distress and make you pay more attention to the source of your problems. As Goldman, a psychologist and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, explains: “If people don't have structure and are sitting around with less to focus on, then they also probably will find themselves thinking about the stressful situation more, which can also lead to additional stress and anxiety.""
 
One way to get out of this cycle that promotes ruminating over the source of your stress is to maintain some structure and routine throughout your day.
 
Research has consistently shown that routines can play an important role in mental health.﻿﻿ One study, for example, found that routines could help people better manage stress and anxiety.﻿﻿ 
 
Having a regular routine can help you:
 
Getting necessary tasks out of the way can also help you find more time for healthy behaviors like exercise and leave you more time to enjoy fun activities and hobbies. 
 
Some things that you can do that will help you maintain a routine when you’re stressed:
 
Managing your own behaviors can help you feel more in control of the situation. Goldman recommends focusing on the things that are within your power to control.
 A good place to start with creating a new routine is to set wake-up and bedtimes, as well as meal and activity times. 
The key is to create a routine that adds structure and a sense of predictability to your day. Of course, your schedule may change somewhat depending on the day of the week, but sticking to a basic structure for when you will wake, eat, work, do activities, and sleep can help you feel less stressed out and more organized. 
 
Structuring your day also ensures that you accomplish those basic tasks that must be done, which will leave you with the time to schedule in other things that you want or need to accomplish.
 You’ll feel more organized and productive with a regular routine, which will help you feel more proactive and in control in the face of a stressful situation. 
There are some things that you can make a part of your daily routine to help manage stress levels. These include:
 
Of course, the situation you personally are coping with can also affect how easy or hard it is to stick to a daily routine. Stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 have left many people with blank schedules, which can be a daunting prospect for many people. It’s important to find things to fill your time so you don’t end up engaging in unhelpful or unhealthy behaviors. 
 
One helpful activity is to make a list of the things that you normally do during the day. Include everything from work to meal preparation to household chores. Once you have an idea of the basic tasks you need to accomplish, you can start creating a general outline for what you might need to accomplish each day to stay on track.
 Stress can make it hard to concentrate, so outlining these daily activities can help you better focus on what’s important. 
While its important to get the essentials done, be sure to find things that you can look forward to, whether it’s watching a favorite television show or calling up a friend. Making these little rewards a part of your routine can help you stay upbeat and focused when you are working on a task that you might not enjoy as much.
 
Is it better to have a structured daily schedule or just a general to-do list for the day? Some people might thrive with a highly structured daily schedule that outlines activities in specific blocks of time, while others might do well with a loose list of things they need to get done in the day. 
 
How do you decide which approach is right for you? Consider your motivations as well as what you need to get done. “If it is something that is of high importance and needs to get done on a specific day, then scheduling it into your routine and carving out that time may be necessary to make sure it gets accomplished,” Goldman recommends.
 
In other words, deliberately schedule a specific time to take care of those high priority tasks. Knowing that you have that time set aside for those tasks will leave you free to focus on using the rest of your time effectively. Goldman also suggests that it may be helpful to schedule things that you may not be motivated to do.
 When we don’t feel motivated to do things, it is very easy to procrastinate doing them and they will continue to get pushed for the next day and the next day. 
Knowing that you need to do those tasks at a certain time on a certain day will help keep you on track and hopefully overcome the urge to just keep putting them off.
 
Just like trying to create a new habit, starting and sticking to a new routine takes some time and effort. You know yourself best, so if something doesn't seem to be working, try tweaking your schedule to make it work for your needs.
 
Goldman recommends paying attention to how you feel throughout the day in order to determine what times of day you are the most productive. ""If you feel like each day you feel unmotivated and lethargic at a certain time, then that is a sign that you may need a mental break at that time,"" she says.
 
When you find yourself in those moments, think about what you might need to feel better and get motivated. That might mean that you need to take a break, go for a walk, have a snack, or spend some time working on a hobby.
 Structure your day to make the most of the natural ebb and flow of your energy levels. You'll get more done and ensure that you're getting what you need in terms of rest and relaxation. 
“Plans don’t always go as planned though, so remember to be kind to yourself,” says Goldman. “This is not the time to put extra pressure and expectations on yourself. It's not easy to create new routines, or add structure to a day, when our lives feel completely disrupted and turned upside down, so it may take some time to get used to this ""new"" routine and be able to feel accomplished.”
 While having a routine is important, give yourself some flexibility and don’t beat yourself up if you have trouble sticking to your own schedule. Everyone copes with stress differently. Having a routine can help you maintain a sense of normalcy and focus through tough times, but don’t stress yourself out more if you sometimes deviate from your plans.

The stress of unemployment can take a serious toll on your well-being under any circumstance. But during the coronavirus pandemic, your stress levels may be even higher than usual.
 
With our current situation and the state of the global economy, there is a much lower chance of landing a new job anytime soon. And it’s unclear when social distancing measures will end or what shape the economy will be in when you are able to return to work.
 
Add in the fear of getting sick, the inability to leave home, and the need to educate your children, and you’ve got a recipe for an increased risk of mental health issues.
 
Fortunately, there are some things you can do to cope with the stress in a healthy way if you’ve lost your job. Managing your distress and taking positive action may help you maintain your mental health during this crisis.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Unemployment has been linked to a greater risk of depression, anxiety, suicide, substance abuse, and violence.﻿﻿
 In fact, studies show people who lose their jobs are twice as likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms when compared with people who remain stably employed. 
Here are several reasons why not having a job can take a serious toll on your psychological well-being: 
 
There are two main things you can do to manage your mental health when faced with this situation: address your unemployment, and address how you feel about being unemployed.
 
It’s important to take action that will help solve your problems when you’re unemployed, such as looking for resources that help you manage your financial strain and looking for employment. 
 During the coronavirus pandemic, however, looking for work might not be so easy. You might be waiting for businesses to open up, so you can return to your old job. Or you might not be certain if your old job will even exist when this is over. 
There are few places hiring right now, so your chances of getting another job at the moment are limited. But this doesn’t mean you should idly wait for things to get better. You can take action now to manage your finances and address your employment situation.
 
This action might include things such as:
 
In addition to addressing your employment issues, you can also address your emotional distress head-on.
 
There are many employment and financial resources that have become available during the coronavirus pandemic for individuals who have lost their jobs. 
 
Whether you’re concerned about health insurance, or you’re having difficulty paying your utility bill, 211 may be able to direct you to someone who can help. They specialize in locating helpful resources, and it’s free of charge.
 
Every state offers slightly different benefits and services, so it’s important to go to your state’s website. The website can help you locate financial assistance programs and an application for unemployment. 
 
This website explains unemployment benefits and can help you discover your eligibility.
 
This bill, enacted in March 2020, explains unemployment benefits, paid sick leave rules, and food assistance benefits during the pandemic.
 
Small businesses may apply for low-interest disaster loans, some of which may be forgiven. Learn more here
 
The Feeding America website provides information on local food banks and how to access them during this crisis.
 It’s frustrating and scary to be unemployed. And it’s tough to plan for the future right now due to the uncertainty of the situation. But taking care of yourself and your mental health can help you cope with some of the distress you’re feeling. If you’re struggling to manage your mental health, however, it’s not a sign of weakness. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Talking to a therapist can help. And there are many ways to reach out to a therapist online right now, so you don’t even have to leave home to do it. How to Protect Your Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic How to Transition To Online Therapy Controlling Your Temper While in Quarantine (From Verywell Family) Creative Alternatives to Fitness Routines (From Verywell Fit) Pandemic Unemployment Insurance and Leave Benefits (From The Balance) Coronavirus and The Workforce: What You Should Know (From The Balance) Research shows that unemployment is associated with increased depression and anxiety. Acknowledging your feelings can help you heal from the loss and move on.  When you feel overwhelmed, focus on what you can control and take action.  Difficulty paying for basic necessities: Reduced income makes it difficult to purchase food and pay for housing. The associated stress makes it difficult to stay mentally healthy. Lack of purpose: Not contributing to society and not bringing home any income to support the family can leave some people feeling as though their lives lack meaning and purpose. Reduced social interaction: Not having a job can mean less social interaction, which takes a direct toll on mood and well-being.  Fewer resources available to maintain mental health: When your time and energy have to go into managing your life (food, housing, and basic necessities), you have fewer resources left to devote to behaviors that promote good mental health (exercising, maintaining social relationships, etc).  Unhealthy coping skills may be more tempting: While some people may respond to unemployment by cutting things that cost extra, others turn to unhealthy coping skills like drugs and alcohol, which can take a toll on health and well-being. Apply for unemployment: Filing for unemployment may reduce your financial strain. Look for new job opportunities: Whether you search for a new full-time job, or you look for ways to make money in the “gig economy,” actively searching for work can help you feel better. Create a budget: Creating a budget can help you gain a better sense of control over your financial situation. Manage your payments: Explaining your situation to your credit card company, mortgage lender, and other financial institutions may help lower your payments. Financial institutions may also grant you more time to pay your bills. Search for helpful resources: Whether you want to talk to a career counselor, or you’re looking for help with paying your electric bill, there may be resources available. Further your education: Taking classes for credit or signing up for an online course for your own enrichment could be helpful to your career. Update your resume: Updating your resume (and asking for feedback from others) might increase your chances of landing a job if you start applying for new positions. Practice good self-care: Getting plenty of sleep and eating a healthy diet is key to managing your distress. You need to take care of your body if you want your mind to function at an optimal level.  Maintain social interaction: While you may not be able to meet with your friends in person, it’s important to stay in contact. Video chat, talk on the phone, or message one another regularly. Positive social interaction can greatly improve your mental health. Structure your day: Staying on a schedule can help you feel better. Create time to work on your job situation, time for leisure, and time to do things that help improve your mental health. Get physically active: Exercise is a key component to good mental health. During the pandemic, you may need to get creative since most gyms are closed. But working out in your living room with an app or video can go a long way toward helping you stay physically and mentally healthy. Reach for healthy coping skills: Writing in a journal, meditating, deep breathing, and yoga are just a few examples of healthy ways to relieve stress. Make sure you have plenty of healthy coping skills at your disposal, so you can reach for something healthy when your distress starts to increase. Eliminate unhealthy coping skills: You might be tempted to turn to things that give you some immediate relief—like alcohol or food. But these things will cause more problems for you in the long term. So make unhealthy coping skills harder to access, and monitor your use. You don’t want to accidentally create bigger problems or introduce new problems into your life.  “Change the channel” when you’re ruminating: Dwelling on things you have no control over will keep you stuck in an unhealthy state. If you find yourself thinking about how awful your life is, or you’re making catastrophic predictions, then interrupt yourself. Get up and do something to change the channel in your brain. Distract yourself with a chore or activity. Talk to a professional if you’re struggling: If you’re feeling depressed or anxious, or you’re having difficulty functioning, contact a mental health professional. Talk therapy or medication may help you feel better.",stress unemployment take serious toll well circumstance coronavirus pandemic stress level may even higher usual current situation state global

COVID-19 presents unique challenges for all of us. One group, in particular though, is finding that being at home, with little to no access to in-person services, is creating hardships and challenges they were not expecting. 
 
Over 20 million adults aged 18 or older have a substance use disorder. For many, rehab facilities, treatment centers, outpatient services, support meetings, and individual therapy are part of their ongoing treatment and recovery. Unfortunately, most of these services have changed from in-person to online, telehealth, or phone consultations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
 
Not only does this change how, or if someone gets help for an addiction, the effects of added stress can trigger a previous disorder for someone that is in recovery. The good news? There are resources available for people in recovery and their loved ones during this time.
 
“COVID-19 has created definite challenges in the world of rehab facilities, group meetings, and treatment centers,” says Dayry Hulkow, primary therapist at Arete Recovery, a Delphi Health Group facility. People requiring higher levels of care, such as medical detox and residential treatment, may be limited depending on their geographical location. That said, Hulkow points out that emergency services are always available. 
 
Clinical psychologist Kevin Gilliland, PsyD, the Executive Director of Innovation 360, says addiction specialists have been challenged to meet the demands of those still addicted as well as those that are trying to stay healthy in the midst of incredibly stressful times. 
 We can still do some face to face meetings with all the CDC precautions and are trying to make that decision based on the severity of the addiction as well as other factors like the person’s support system, their risk for relapse, other psychiatric conditions. 
Plus, people are able to access support online or through telephonic and video meetings and sessions. There are also some great written resources that are helpful for some.
 If you are accessing lower levels of care, such as 12-step support, you can still receive services through online formats. There are also many helplines and hotlines available by phone or email, both locally and nationally. 
Hulkow also stresses the importance of staying virtually connected with supportive family and friends as much as possible. 
 
To help facilitate treatment and recovery efforts, many support groups, organizations, and treatment centers have shifted to an online model of providing services. Through video chats, conference calls, live video meetings, and individual counseling sessions, people dealing with a substance use disorder can continue to get help while waiting for the social distancing orders to be lifted. 
 
Many experts say that addiction is a disease of isolation and that social distancing measures could impact the likelihood of people turning to drugs and alcohol to cope. This is intensified by the fact that many people in recovery rely on the human contact you experience in a support meeting or outpatient group counseling setting. 
 
The stress of illness, social isolation, and unemployment are all significant triggers to relapse, says Hulkow, and many people turn to substances such as alcohol, drugs, or even food as a way to cope with stressful situations.
 
“Stress is particularly problematic for people with addictions because the primary path of managing the spread of this virus is social isolation and isolation is the most savage of mental illness symptoms,” says Gilliland. “Isolation is a risk for a return to substance use or an escalation of use.”
 
Unemployment and financial hardships are also major stressors for humans, which Gilliland says can lead to depression pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it also increases the chances of people using substances. “Sometimes, we abuse substances to get away from a feeling more than to go to a feeling,” he adds.
 
But the thing that everyone is starting to feel is the lack of physical presence. “There is simply no getting around the fact that a phone call doesn’t do as much as being in person,” says Gilliland. “And as providers, what we don’t know, is how much longer this arms-distance support (phone/video) can continue to help people maintain abstinence, this is all new territory,” says Gilliland. 
 From a treatment standpoint, Gilliand says they are trying to balance providing treatment for an illness that can kill people with helping to maintain their physical health from this virus. 
“This is, unfortunately, a time that much of the work falls on the shoulders of people that are struggling,” says Gilliland. Because of this, anyone impacted by addiction is left to figure out what helps and what doesn’t.
 
“That is hard work to do when you have someone helping you and incredibly hard work when you feel the fatigue and lack of energy that we all feel right now,” he says. Gilliland’s advice? Keep after it.
 Focus on putting one foot in front of the other and try something to move you forward today. Just today. 
While this current situation is presenting difficulties in accessing services, many therapists, addiction experts, support groups, and treatment centers are moving to an online forum to continue providing care. Many therapists can do individual counseling, couples counseling, and family counseling online. There are also some really wonderful video recovery meetings and podcasts available.
 
Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and several social distancing and stay-at-home orders, the American Society of Addiction Medicine released clinical guidance as well as resources in real-time for educational and information pertaining to addiction medicine. 
 
If you are currently under the care of a doctor or mental health expert, please talk with them first about accessing services. You can also find support and information from various organizations that are now offering online services. In addition to the resources listed below, Verywell created a comprehensive list that links to helplines, support meetings, and telehealth services. 
 Finding support during this difficult time is essential for both our physical and mental health. If you are struggling with substance abuse issues, make sure and talk with your doctor or a mental health expert. In addition to direct care, they can help you find online resources and support meetings. 
Finally, if you’re thinking about suicide or suspect someone you love is in danger of hurting themselves, seek help immediately. Call 911, and if possible, stay with a friend or family member until you are in the care of a mental health expert. 
 
The Verywell team is here for you during this difficult time. We will continue to update our website and provide you with the most up-to-date information related to COVID-19 and your health. Take care and be well.

It’s tough to know how to help during this coronavirus pandemic. You may find that you have more time on your hands right now than ever. You might even be out of work with nothing to do and nowhere to go.
 
At the same time, the news is currently full of stories about people who are struggling all over in many ways. It’s easy to find yourself feeling overwhelmed and confused about how you can help.
 
Fortunately, there are some things you can do right now to help during this crisis without leaving your home. And most of these won’t even cost you any money.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Although you might feel as though you’re sitting around doing nothing, staying home is the best thing you can do right now. Not only will it keep you safer, but it’ll also protect those in your community (including healthcare workers).
 
So when you’re sitting around thinking about all the things you wish you could be doing to help, remind yourself that staying home is an important job in itself right now.
 
If you feel compelled to do something while you’re at home, then get some items ready to donate. Clean out your closets, and see if you have any clothes you can give away. Or go through your household goods, and see if any of these are available to be donated to people in need. Then, when it’s safe to be in the community again, donate your items to a local charity.
 
Call your friends and neighbors to check on them. You might find an elderly neighbor isn’t aware that they can have their groceries delivered. Or you may discover your friend needs some emotional support.
 
Video chat, call, or message people just to say you’re thinking of them. Let them know you’re available if they want to talk (if you are willing to do so).
 Send handwritten notes too. Right now many people would love to get a letter or card in the mail that reminds them you’re thinking of them. 
You probably know quite a few folks who are more vulnerable to the infection than you are. You should obviously stay home as much as possible, but it can be really dangerous for people over 65 and those with compromised immune systems to even make a trip to the store.
 
If you have the extra time or hands, consider doing a grocery run for someone who would benefit. Just leave it on their step and wear gloves when handling their bags.
 
There’s a lot of bad news circulating on social media these days about “death tolls” and the economic downturn. There are a lot of heated discussions about politics as well.
 
So commit to sharing a little kindness and good news. Compliment your friends, send a kind note to someone you appreciate, or share some feel-good positive news. Sharing such things could brighten someone else’s day.
 
If you’d like to offer more emotional support, sign up to become a volunteer listener at 7 Cups. It’s a website where anyone can chat with a trained listener about any subject they wish.
 
7 Cups provides free training to anyone who wishes to be a volunteer listener. Once you complete their online course, you can volunteer to chat with people who are looking for support. You choose when to make yourself available, so it’s up to you to decide how much time you want to spend volunteering as a listener.
 
Crisis Text Line is a free text line available to anyone in the United States who needs help. Crisis Counselors are volunteers who answer text messages. They may provide active listening, collaborative problem solving, and safety planning for anyone in need.
 
Volunteers must undergo a screening process and complete a lengthy self-paced training. Then, they can take a four-hour shift once a week.
 Keep in mind that this position is more of a commitment than the others. They prefer volunteers to remain with them for at least one year since the training costs them money to administer. 
If you have extra money right now, consider donating to a charity. There’s a good chance many charities in your community are looking for help dealing with coronavirus—food banks, homeless shelters, etc.
 
Or you might look for a national charity too. Just make sure you do some homework on them so you’re clear on how your money will be used.
 
Whether you want to support your local restaurant who had to temporarily shut their doors, or you want to support an independent bookstore, buying a gift card right now could help them immensely.
 
A gift card will give the establishment funds right away. This could help support them now if business is slow or help them to re-open later if they’ve had to close down.
 
Check their website to see if you can buy a gift card online, so you don’t have to leave home. Even if they aren’t open to the public at the moment, they may still be able to process gift cards.
 
If you have some extra time on your hands, consider signing up to be a mentor at CareerVillage. Sign up and explain what types of career questions you’re able to answer.
 
Then, when someone has a question that is related to your topic, you’ll get notified. You can respond online and share information with individuals who are interested in your career.
 
It’s a great way to mentor someone who is just starting out or to help guide a student who is thinking about their future career options.
 
Individuals who are blind or have low vision may need help with many things, such as reading expiration dates or distinguishing between colors. 
 
When you volunteer for Be My Eyes, you can help with those things by video chatting and communicating what you see. You can choose what times you’re available to accept calls, and you may be asked to assist with a variety of tasks.
 Giving to people in need right now may help you feel better about the current situation. And while it’s a little tricky to find ways to help during this crisis, you can likely find some opportunities to assist others without leaving home.

Most people find working from home to be challenging—especially at first. From piles of dirty laundry to day time TV, there are tons of distractions.
 
And sometimes, pajamas and a comfortable seat on the sofa just don’t provide the same type of motivation you get from a suit and an office chair.
 
Whether you’re home alone and the house is too quiet, or you’re home with the family and the kids are out of control, you may find it’s tough to stay on task, get your work done, and feel productive. Fortunately, the following strategies can help you stay motivated when you work from home.
 
Without a structured workday, time can get away from you. You might find that you start shifting your workdays later and later as you sip an extra cup of coffee. Then, your work hours extend later into the evenings, which causes you to stay up later at night as well.
 
Or you might find that you easily get off track or distracted while working. And projects that used to take 20 minutes are suddenly lasting 2 hours.
 
That’s why it’s important to have a clear schedule. Establish a time to begin and end work. Try to stick to it as much as you can.
 
You might be tempted to work in bed. After all, it’s likely the most comfortable space in the house.
 
But when you associate your bed with work, it can interfere with your sleep. And trouble sleeping will affect your performance the following day. Most sleep experts recommend reserving your bed for sleep and sexual activity.
 
So even though your bed might feel like a comfortable spot, create a workspace somewhere else. The kitchen table or a desk in the corner of the living room might be better alternatives to your bedroom.
 
Blocking out small amounts of time—and planning what you’ll do during that timeframe—can make big tasks feel more manageable.
 
You might find you have more motivation when telling yourself that you just need to complete one invoice in the next 30 minutes, rather than telling yourself that you have 50 invoices to create by lunchtime.
 
Scheduling your time will also hold you more accountable. You’ll be less likely to get lost on social media when you know you only have 15 minutes to complete a task. And you’ll be less likely to procrastinate when you’ve given yourself a tight deadline.
 
You might find that you struggle to get back on task each time you’re interrupted. You can stay motivated by limiting the distractions and interruptions you experience.
 
This may mean muting your phone notifications and only checking your email once an hour. Or place your phone on “Do Not Disturb” until you complete a specific task.
 
If you’re working from home with kids, keep them occupied to reduce how often they interrupt you. Give them tasks to do and plan to check on them at a certain time.
 
Establish some ground rules about what constitutes a legitimate reason for them interrupting you while working. Then, you can reward them for playing well on their own with a chance to do something extra fun when you’re finished working.
 
It can be hard to convince yourself to start working on a task you really don’t want to do. Whether you know it’s going to be boring, frustrating, or just really challenging, convincing yourself to get started is tough.
 
One of the best ways to get moving on something you don’t want to do is by using the “10-minute rule.” Tell yourself that you only have to work on something for 10 minutes. Then, after the 10-minute mark, you can take a break if you want.
 
More times than not, you’ll likely find that at the 10-minute mark you’ll choose to keep going. Usually, getting started is the toughest part. But once you do, it’s easy to keep the momentum going.
 
You might find you work best when you know there’s a little reward waiting for you. For example, tell yourself you can watch your favorite show if you get your work done by 6 PM. Or tell yourself you can have a cup of your favorite tea as soon as you finish this report.
 
A little incentive can often go a long way toward helping you get work done efficiently. And it’ll help you see what you’re capable of accomplishing.
 
Sometimes, a little challenge can help get you moving too. For example, you might try to write a certain amount of words in 30 minutes. Once you see how many words you write in 30 minutes, you might try beating that during the next 30-minute time slot.
 
You might also make some discoveries about yourself. Maybe you type faster when you’re sitting at the kitchen table, or perhaps you have better focus right after lunch. Learning these things about yourself might help you set your day up for success.
 
Being more aware of your time helps you use it wisely. And challenging yourself in some way might provide the extra incentive you need.
 
You’ll never be at your best if you’re exhausted and running on caffeine and sugar only. You need a healthy diet, plenty of rest, and good self-care strategies to perform at your peak.
 
But meeting your physical, social, and emotional needs right now will be a bit more challenging than usual. Eating a healthy diet might not be as easy when you’re limiting your trips to the grocery store. And video chatting with friends isn’t the same as meeting in person. 
 
So take a step back every once in a while and ask yourself what else you can do to take care of yourself better. As your stress level increases, your self-care should increase right alongside it.
 
There are plenty of online tips about how to work well from home. But everyone is different. And what works for one person might not work well for another.
 
So it’s important to experiment with different strategies to discover what works well for you. You might find you feel more motivated in the evenings, or you might have more energy after a morning workout.
 
Research shows we tend to put off tasks that stir up uncomfortable emotions.﻿﻿ If you’re anxious about a medical appointment, you might not be motivated to call the doctor. Or if you’re afraid studying will bring frustration, you might find yourself binge-watching Netflix instead.
 
In these cases, the lack of motivation stems from your desire to avoid discomfort. And when you’re working from home, there are always plenty of opportunities to engage in something more fun than the work you’re supposed to be doing.
 
So consider what emotion(s) you’re trying to avoid feeling. Acknowledging the emotion might make it feel less scary. Remind yourself that you can handle feeling uncomfortable.
 
Additionally, remind yourself of how good you’ll feel when you get the project done as opposed to how bad you’ll feel if you don’t do the work. This might remind you to take action regardless of whether you feel like it.
 Working from home can be challenging in the best of circumstances. But if you find yourself working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, the added stress of the situation will make it harder than usual to stay motivated. Be willing to cut yourself a little slack if your productivity isn’t on par. Rather than beat yourself up for not being motivated enough, you might find a little self-compassion goes a long way toward helping you feel your best. Working remotely is even more challenging during COVID-19 with extra stress and added distractions from family members. A few simple strategies can help keep you motivated and on task. Don't be too hard on yourself right now; we're all doing our best under these unprecedented circumstances.",people find work home challenge especially first pile dirty laundry day time tons distractions sometimes pajamas comfortable seat sofa provide type motivation get suit office chair whether home alone house quiet home family kid control may find tough stay task get work feel productive fortunately follow strategies help stay motivate work home without structure workday time get away might find start shift workdays later later sip extra cup coffee work hours extend later even cause stay later night well might find easily get track distract work project use take minutes suddenly last hours important clear schedule establish time begin end work try stick much might tempt work bed likely comfortable space house associate bed work interfere sleep trouble sleep affect performance follow day sleep experts recommend reserve bed sleep sexual activity even though bed might feel like comfortable spot create workspace somewhere else kitchen table desk corner live room might better alternatives bedroom block small amount time plan timeframe make big task feel manageable might find motivation tell need complete one invoice next minutes rather tell invoice create lunchtime schedule time also hold accountable less likely get lose social media know minutes complete task less likely procrastinate give tight deadline might find struggle get back task time interrupt stay motivate limit distractions interruptions experience may mean mute phone notifications check email hour place phone disturb complete specific task work home kid keep occupy reduce often interrupt give task plan check certain time establish grind rule constitute legitimate reason interrupt work reward play well chance something extra fun finish work hard convince start work task really want whether know bore frustrate really challenge convince get start tough one best ways get move something want use minute rule tell work something minutes minute mark take break want time likely find minute mark choose keep usually get start toughest part easy keep momentum might find work best know little reward wait example tell watch favorite show get work tell cup favorite tea soon finish report little incentive often long way toward help get work efficiently help see capable accomplish sometimes little challenge help get move example might try write certain amount word minutes see many word write minutes might try beat next minute time slot might also make discoveries maybe type faster sit kitchen table perhaps better focus right lunch learn things might help set day success aware time help use wisely challenge way might provide extra incentive need never best exhaust run caffeine sugar need healthy diet plenty rest good self care strategies perform peak meet physical social emotional need right bite challenge usual eat healthy diet might easy limit trip grocery store video chat friends meet person take step back every ask else take care better stress level increase self care increase right alongside plenty online tip work well home everyone different work one person might work well another important experiment different strategies discover work well might find feel motivate even might energy morning workout research show tend put task stir uncomfortable emotions anxious medical appointment might motivate call doctor afraid study bring frustration might find binge watch netflix instead case lack motivation stem desire avoid discomfort work home always plenty opportunities engage something fun work suppose consider emotion try avoid feel acknowledge emotion might make feel less scary remind handle feel uncomfortable additionally remind good feel get project oppose bad feel work might remind take action regardless whether feel like work home challenge best circumstances find work remotely coronavirus pandemic add stress situation make harder usual stay motivate will cut little slack productivity par rather beat motivate enough might find little self compassion long way toward help feel best work remotely even challenge covid extra stress add distractions family members simple strategies help keep motivate task hard right best unprecedented circumstances

The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders have put a strain on all of us regardless of where we live or who we live with. While there are some perks to living alone during this time—like not feeling the emotional burden of looking after young children or circumventing the interpersonal intricacies of sharing tight quarters with someone else 24/7—isolating without others presents a unique set of challenges.
 Those who live alone may need to be especially deliberate in planning their days during this time, holding themselves accountable in ways they maybe aren't used to as everyday routines are tossed to the wind. 
Fortunately, there are some effective strategies you can employ that will foster a healthier mindset if you're sheltering by yourself.
 
Perhaps the most effective way people living alone can maintain optimal emotional health—both in good times and especially in not-so-good times—is to nurture their friendships and family relationships. 
 
""More time at home offers more time to call, write, and video chat with loved ones. Consider a weekly Zoom meeting with extended family from all around the country, and/or connect with friends for online happy hours, exercise classes, book groups, and all manner of creative activities,” advises Lorna Hecht, a therapist based in San Diego.
 Humans are social animals who absolutely depend on connection for emotional health. Plus, talking with others about your fears can help put them in perspective and help others to relieve their worries. 
These virtual or online chats can be 1:1 or small groups, or they can be with a larger group of people. If you find yourself without many people to turn to, then Hecht recommends scheduling a telehealth session with a therapist who can guide and encourage you while also being a reliable person you can speak with as needed.
 
Now might also be a good time to consider developing new friendships, which you can do through online forums and even virtual volunteer opportunities in your community.
 
It can be so easy to melt away into a creamy batch of macaroni and cheese while curled into a ball on your couch—and in moderation that’s perfectly acceptable. But also strive to take care of your body by eating well, exercising often, and getting some daily sunshine. Not only can this improve your mental health by creating structure and distracting you from the noise of an overwhelming news cycle, but it pays in spades to your physical health.
 Regarding exercise, this could be something as simple as taking a daily walk or as involved as working out with friends via FaceTime. To hold yourself accountable, keep track of your workouts, have an ‘accountability buddy,’ or even consider a friendly competition with friends. 
There are many free workouts available online (YouTube and Instagram are excellent resources for this), and many on-demand workout services are either reducing or waiving monthly membership fees during this time, as well. If you were a regular at a local gym, check in to see if it's offering on-demand options or online alternatives.
 
In terms of nourishing your body, try to make cooking a fun exercise; the act itself can relieve stress and distract you. If you hate the idea of cooking for one, either make enough to have leftovers or perhaps even drop off a portion at a neighbor’s home. Aim for naturally colorful meals and whole foods and limit the amount of sugar, salt, and simple carbohydrates you’re consuming on a daily basis. 
 
There’s some push back on the topic of taking up a new hobby during this time, and if you simply don’t have the mental capacity or the time to do so then that’s OK. Generally speaking, however, exploring new creative outlets or improving upon an existing skillset can be a boon to your mental health. 
 Engaging the intellect strengthens parts of the brain that humans need to stay mentally sharp and focused. Also, intellectual projects ward off boredom and energy spent on learning something new is energy not spent on negative thinking, feeling, and behavior. 
This could be something like researching a new topic of interest, learning to play a new game, or diving into a craft like cross-stitch, single-line drawing, or gardening. You could also try reading a non-fiction book, writing poetry, learning calligraphy, baking bread, or memorizing the countries and capitals of the world.
 
Pencil some time into your day to dive into your chosen activity and even consider joining an online group that supports the hobby, too.
 
Though you are not likely to get sick from the novel coronavirus if you’re carefully self-isolating, it’s still important to monitor any potential symptoms you might have and relay them to friends or family.
 
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlines COVID-19 symptoms as a persistent dry cough, a fever, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms might include sore throat, headaches, body aches, and gastrointestinal issues. The CDC website provides a “self-check” questionnaire on the website that can guide you if you're uncertain about how serious your symptoms are.
 
It is rare to fall critically ill—and even rarer to die—from COVID-19 related complications. This is particularly true if you’re under 65 and without underlying medical conditions. However, being mindful of your symptoms is still important. If you feel like you’re experiencing symptoms, let a friend or family member know and consult a healthcare physician for the next steps forward.
 The COVID-19 threat has created many challenges, and if you live alone you may need to be particularly vigilant when planning your time in order to ensure your mental health. Stay informed but limit your exposure to the 24-hour news cycle and social media. Take the initiative to reach out to friends and family daily, be deliberate about what you eat and how you’re moving, throw yourself into meaningful activities, and speak with a teletherapist if needed.

"
The media we consume daily has an impact on our thinking, behavior, and emotions. If you’ve fallen into a pattern of regularly watching or listening to the news, the majority of what you’re consuming is likely about the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis.
 
And while staying up to date on local and national news, especially as it relates to mandates and health updates, is critical during this time, experts say over-consumption of the news can take a toll on your physical, emotional, and mental health. 
 With that in mind, the goal is to find the balance between feeling informed and educated on the situation at hand while not becoming totally overwhelmed by it. After all, when good news is available, or the situation changes for the better, it will come to you, you won't need to seek it out. 
We asked several mental health experts to explain how this constant stream of disastrous news is adding to our stress levels and increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Plus, tips on how to navigate the 24-hour news cycle, while still managing and protecting your mental health.
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 outbreak is proving to be stressful for most people. During an infectious disease outbreak, the CDC says stress can include changes in sleep or eating patterns, worsening of mental health conditions, fear and worry about your health and the health of loved ones, and difficulty concentrating.
 
Compounding this stress is the constant stream of news about COVID-19 that we are exposed to on a daily, hourly, and even minute-by-minute basis. “Unfortunately, a lot of the news we consume today isn’t so much reporting as it is a way of keeping people addicted to the news cycle,” says licensed psychologist, Logan Jones, PsyD.
 
Because sensational headlines get more attention, Jones says media outlets often end up focusing on disaster reporting—and rarely any positive news.
 Consuming too much of this kind of news, whether actively or passively, can be very toxic, and what you hear has an impact on your mood. 
Even if it's just noise in the background, Jones says an alarmist news broadcast will still have a negative effect on your psyche.
 
“It can be damaging to constantly be reading the news because constant exposure to negative information can impact our brain,” says Annie Miller, MSW, LCSW-C, LICSW. When we experience a threat, Miller says our brain activates the fight or flight response, and the systems in our body react accordingly.
 
Consuming the news can activate the sympathetic nervous system, which causes your body to release stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Then, when a crisis is happening, and we are experiencing this stress response more frequently, Miller says physical symptoms may arise. Some of the most common symptoms are fatigue, anxiety, depression, and trouble sleeping.
 
This emotional toll and negative effect on the psyche was demonstrated in a study that found people who watched negative material, as compared to those who watched positive or neutral material, showed an increase in both anxious and sad moods only after 14-minutes of viewing television news bulletins and programs.﻿﻿
 
In addition to an increase in anxious and sad moods, the researchers also found the results to be consistent with the theories of worry that implicate negative mood as a causal factor in facilitating worrisome thought.
 
Like a lot of things, the key to staying healthy is moderation. ""Staying informed is not just responsible, but critical to our safety right now, explains Kellie Casey Cook, MS, licensed professional counselor. 
 
To strike the balance of moderation while staying informed, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seeking news about COVID-19 mainly so that you can take practical steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and your loved ones. Once you have that information, it’s time to turn the news off.
 To help alleviate the mental and emotional toll this is all taking, the CDC recommends taking breaks from watching, listening, or reading news stories, especially since hearing about a pandemic repeatedly is upsetting.  
Leaving your television on or streaming live news broadcasts on your phone while tending to other business can take a toll on you emotionally. Rather than having the news be your background noise, Haley Neidich, LCSW, is recommending less than 30 minutes per day total of social media scrolling and news exposure combined.
 
Scheduling a “worry time” each day is a common strategy for managing the symptoms related to anxiety disorders. Miller says this technique is also helpful for watching and digesting the news cycle. “Scroll through the news, acknowledge anything you are worried about, and make plans for addressing any issues,” she says.
 
Then, choose a time that is far enough away from your bedtime so that your brain has time to settle before you go to bed. The idea, says Miller, is to minimize worry and news intake by scheduling it into your day. After your worry time is over, Miller says to put the news aside and remind yourself that it’s not time to worry right now and move onto other things.
 Your brain will eventually get used to this new routine and it will start to be able to let worries go more easily. 
Once you commit to limiting the amount of news you watch, Ashleigh Edelstein, a licensed marriage and family therapist, says the next step is to gauge how you feel before and after watching to understand how it's affecting you.
 
She says to do a quick check and ask yourself the following question: “Do you feel informed and calm, or panicked, angry, and/or pessimistic?” If it's the latter, Edelstein says to consider how much news you're consuming and the sources you’re getting it from, and make an intention to reduce your consumption.
 
“A healthy way to approach the news cycle is to rely on outlets you know are credible, have experienced reporters who do their research, and provide balanced perspectives,” says Jones. He also says to be mindful of how much you consume.
 You probably have set times every day when you eat, and you can do the same with news. Check-in with what’s going on in the world by consuming the sources that nourish you, and then move on to something else. 
If watching the news is triggering regular symptoms of anxiety or depression, Neidich is recommending no exposure at all. Instead, she suggests that you ask a close friend or loved one to filter the news for you. Then, have them check in with you a few times per week about the most important updates. “There is no reason that any of us need to be exposed to the news beyond that,” says Neidich.
 
Rather than flipping channels and gathering part of news stories from different outlets, Cook says a lot of people find it helpful to subscribe to a daily newsletter or news podcast, as this automatically limits the time and content for you.
 Plus, you can listen to a podcast while you exercise, which can help keep your anxiety and worry levels low. 
According to Jones, healthy news consumption isn’t about denying reality, but it is about creating boundaries. His recommendation for creating boundaries around negative and disastrous news? Reciting a helpful mantra like this one: “Toxic disaster reporting has no power over me. I acknowledge what’s happening in the world, but I will not let it define my life. I’m going to persevere and do my part.”
 
Another point to consider, says Cook, is to give yourself permission to limit your exposure to certain people right now. “If you have a family member who is constantly posting links to questionable articles from unknown sources, go ahead and unfollow them for now. If a friend or coworker insists on having current events related conversations that don’t feel productive and only serve to increase your anxiety, consider putting some boundaries in place with them,” she says.
 
Something along the lines of, “Hey, I’m really starting to feel overwhelmed by this topic, so I’d prefer if we’d change the subject,” can be effective with some people.
 
For most of us, consuming some form of news each day is essential. To help combat feelings of fear, anxiety, and worry that often accompany negative news, Edelstein suggests choosing to do something positive or healthy immediately after, like taking a walk, calling a friend, or working on a hobby. “Because things are so uncertain, we need healthy distractions right now to stay grounded and resilient,” she says.
 Taking steps to minimize stress during this difficult time is essential for both your physical and mental health. While watching the news can provide you with critical information about protecting yourself and others, taking in too much information can be overwhelming and detrimental to your mental health. If you’re having trouble managing a mental health condition or you’re concerned about new symptoms, call your doctor. Also, if you’re thinking about suicide or suspect someone you love is in danger of hurting themselves, seek help immediately. Call 911, and if possible, stay with a friend or family member until you are in the care of a mental health expert. Trying to strike a balance between being informed by news media and not becoming overwhelmed by it is difficult—especially during a global crisis. A constant stream of sensational or ""disaster"" reporting, whether you are exposed actively or passively, can elevate stress levels and trigger symptoms like anxiety and trouble sleeping. Effectively managing your media consumption can help you stay up to date while also reducing your stress.",media consume daily impact think behavior emotions fall pattern regularly watch listen news

"Information presented in this article may be triggering to some people who have experienced trauma due to domestic abuse. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, staying home, avoiding public spaces, and working remotely are all important steps required to reduce the spread of the virus. But for many people who live with someone who is abusive, this may not be the safest option.
 
In fact, stay-at-home orders and shelter-in-place options have become life-threatening for many people; women and children in particular. Their physical and mental health is being compromised every day in the very place where they should feel safest—their homes.
 If you or someone you love is experiencing abuse, call: 1-800-799-7233 If you suspect that your life is in danger call 911 immediately 
In fact, there has been a huge surge in domestic violence cases worldwide. The United Nations reports that nearly every country is showing an increase. For instance, in Malaysia calls have doubled and in France, they are up 32%. The concern is that the number of cases could be much greater due to the number of incidents that go unreported.
 
It's not surprising that domestic violence is growing given the fact that stress, fear, and financial strain often lead to domestic abuse.
 A 2016 study of intimate partner violence during the Great Recession concluded that ""economic upheaval continues to have a disruptive effect on male-female relationships."" 
The researchers added that the Great Recession ""led to an increase in men's controlling behavior toward their wives and romantic partners.""
 
Instances of domestic violence are, of course, not always perpetrated by men, however, this tends to be the case in the majority of reported circumstances.
 
What's more, financial abuse is already common in domestic violence situations. In fact, one study found that almost all survivors they worked with had a partner who controlled their use of or access to economic resources or took advantage of them economically.
 
Studies also show that abusers are more likely to murder their partners during times of crisis. Consequently, the coronavirus is exacerbating an already volatile situation.
 
Children also are being impacted more than in the past. With schools, community centers, and public playgrounds shut down in many areas, there are no more safe refuges for kids.
 
Before the coronavirus, these places served as safe spaces where children could escape the violence at home. Now, they're stuck at home and likely witnessing more domestic abuse than in the past.
 
When victims of domestic abuse are forced to stay in their homes or in close proximity to someone who abuses them, the likelihood that they will experience additional abuse is significant. In fact, people who abuse others will use any tool to their advantage—including a national health concern like COVID-19.
 
According to advocates at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, COVID-19 can impact intimate partner violence in a number of ways. Here are some things people who abuse others may do to control their partners during the pandemic:
 
During this pandemic, it's not uncommon for you to face even more fear and anxiety than you normally would—especially if you're torn between staying physically and emotionally safe and preventing the spread of a highly contagious disease.
 
While everyone's situation is different, here are a few suggestions for dealing with abusive situations. These tips may help make this uncertain time feel a little more manageable.
 
Safety plans are personalized plans that include ideas on how to stay safe while in a relationship with someone who is abusive. These plans often include steps to take when leaving and how to stay safe afterward.
 
The National Domestic Violence Hotline offers a guide on safety planning. But, you may need to get creative with your plan during this pandemic.
 
Before the coronavirus pandemic, women often had the option to go to shelters or to stay with family or friends.
 Unfortunately, options are now limited. Some shelters may be full or closed and staying with a family member may no longer be an option. 
Find out ahead of time which houses you might be able to escape to should you need to find a safe place to stay. Be sure to continue practicing good hygiene, washing your hands regularly, and avoiding touching your face no matter where you stay.
 
Make sure you have all of your important documents handy and that you know the address to your nearest police station.
 You also should have some money on hand or a credit card, as well as a bag with some clothes, medicines, and personal items. Keep your phone and keys nearby as well. You will need to grab these things quickly if you need to escape. 
If at all possible, you should try to stay in touch with family and friends. Use text messaging, FaceTime, social media, email, or other online options to communicate when you can. It's important to build a support network of people who can encourage you and support you during this difficult time.
 
Be careful what you share though in case the person abusing you is monitoring your online activity or abusing you electronically.
 
Getting through this pandemic while experiencing abuse can seem overwhelming, so taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health is even more important.
 
Look for ways to care for yourself while staying safe. For instance, meditating, reciting mantras, journaling, and praying all are helpful ways of coping. Additionally, there are many online yoga and fitness classes that you can take for no charge.
 
Even getting a few moments of fresh air can do wonders for your mental health. Try to do something for yourself each day that eases your anxiety and fear.
 
If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential assistance from trained advocates.
 
You also can use their online chat option to chat privately with an advocate. These professionals can guide you in how to handle your situation or simply lend a supportive ear to listen.

"
While concern over the novel coronavirus slowly trickled in at the start of the new year, it was business as usual for the majority of the globe until suddenly everyone's world came to a screeching halt around the beginning of March. Social gatherings and travel plans have all been canceled, and everyday grocery trips have morphed into potential hazards.
 
The more intricate parts of our lives have been impacted, too, including our interpersonal relationships. For instance, those of us who've just started dating someone new, are now experiencing a particularly tricky scenario.
 
We're excited enough to pursue the relationship—or eager to maintain what we've already built—but are still in that budding phase where you either don’t live together or aren’t intimate enough just yet to warrant routine overnights.
 
Dating during the COVID-19 pandemic is perfectly OK (there are even some benefits), but the inability to see each other face-to-face comes with inherent challenges. Unless you’ve chosen to take the plunge and quarantine together, you’re effectively dating long distance even if you live in the same city.
 
While tricky, dating remotely at this time is certainly feasible. Below we’ve outlined specific, actionable ways you can stay better connected and continue fostering your budding relationship.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
The most important piece of advice when it comes to staying close and connected with your partner is giving them your undivided attention when you’re together (even if you’re physically apart).
 When you’re on the phone together, avoid doing other things that may distract you from what the other person is saying. It’s really easy to have one tab open with your video chat and another scrolling through Facebook. Your significant other can tell when they’re only being half-heard, and your eyes say it all. 
Giving your undivided attention allows for genuine connection and signals that you're invested in them as a person and partner.
 
Social distancing doesn’t have to translate into emotional distancing. Whether your relationship is brand new or you’ve been dating a few months, consider this an opportune time to get emotionally closer to your partner. Simply communicating regularly and continuing to feel out your connection is a great place to start.
 
If you’re really committed, Dr. Venus Nicolino, a clinical psychologist and author, recommends starting a shared personal journal on an open Google document.
 
“Have one person write in the morning and one person write in the evening. The different time gives each partner something to look forward to,” she says. “That diary can consist of your day to day thoughts about what you’re feeling and how you're feeling towards each other. It’s something you’re both creating together while simultaneously documenting the life of your relationship through this difficult time.”
 
Shared experiences bring us together and give us something to talk about. For example, while social distancing you could both choose a book to read at the same time and then set times to discuss it. Not only will it personally relieve stress for each of you and serve as a break from the news cycle, but it’ll promote a deeper connection.
 
“For one, it gets you talking about interesting stuff. Secondly, research shows that sharing new thoughts and ideas through reading together helps couples maintain intimacy. Thirdly, you’ll learn something about your partner as book choices are incredibly revealing,” says Dr. Nicolino.
 
Other ideas might include crafting individually and showing off your end results or having a cook or bake-off. The idea is that you’re doing something similar that will allow you to bond even though you’re physically apart. 
 
One of the best parts of dating someone new is exploring and seeing new things together. In a non-social distancing world that might look like visiting a local museum, going to the movies, or attending a live concert. These are more fun to do in ""real life,"" of course, but with the internet on our side, you can have the next best thing: virtual dates.
 
“For instance, plenty of museums are offering free virtual tours, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Louvre, and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Pick a day and time that works for both of you and get on FaceTime for the virtual tour,” says Dr. Hafeez. “This helps change the pace for you and your partner, keeping things alive and not boring.”
 
Some other ideas include “attending” the same Facebook or Instagram Live concert, virtually exploring a destination in the world, or even making the same meal together and eating it via FaceTime. Dr. Hafeez also recommends going the extra mile by dressing the part!
 If you dress nicely and fix your appearance for normal dates, why stop now? Maintaining effort in any relationship is always important. Do your hair, freshen up, and set the mood for you and your partner. Keeping things playful and exciting will make all the difference while you spend time apart. 
If you both share a desire to become sexually intimate (or maintain this intimacy) then lean into it. What sets romantic relationships apart from any other relationship is a sexual bond. In the context of social distancing, this might look like steamy text conversations, phone sex, or even FaceTime sex. 
 
Looking toward the future is a great way to keep spirits high and to remind each other that there’s an end to this temporary upheaval. It also signals that you see promise in your connection and desire to continue your relationship and/or eventually take it to the next level.
 
“[One idea is to] plan a trip with your significant other for when everything has settled down. Not only does it give you both something to look forward to, but planning an adventure is also a really fun activity for both of you to do. It will help take your minds off the current situation and remind you that this is not temporary,” says Dr. Hafeez.
 You can make a list of things you can’t wait to do together once you’re able to be together physically, whether it’s as small as cooking a meal together, making out, strolling through the park, or planning an adventurous date outdoors.  The Do's and Don'ts of Social Distancing Starting a New Relationship in the Time of Coronavirus Coping With Loneliness During the Coronavirus Pandemic How Parents Can Take Time for Themselves During Quarantine (From Verywell Family) Sex and Love in the Time of Coronavirus (From Verywell Health) Quarantine and social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic have significantly impacted people's social and dating lives.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to sweeping changes and disruptions in nearly every aspect of daily life. With mandates and guidelines changing all the time, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by our own anxieties. It is important to practice empathy during this time, not only for others but for yourself as well. 
 
There are many benefits to practicing empathy. Empathizing with others can help you feel less lonely and more connected. It also increases the likelihood that people will reach out and help others when they need it.
 
In addition to boosting social connectedness and increasing helping behaviors, empathizing with others also improves your ability to regulate your emotions during times of stress. Feeling empathy allows you to better manage the anxiety you are experiencing without feeling overwhelmed.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Some people are just empathetic by nature, but there are plenty of things that you can do to cultivate your own empathy skills. Research has also shown that empathy is an emotional skill that can be learned.﻿﻿
 Listening to others, engaging in acts of service, observing the empathetic actions of others, and imagining yourself in another person's situation are all strategies that can help build empathy. 
Here are some things you can do to try to stay empathetic even when it feels like staying in touch with other people is more difficult than ever.
 
In a time when people are practicing social distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine, it’s all too easy to turn inward and focus solely on yourself or your family unit. But research suggests that caring about others is one of the best ways to fight feelings of isolation.﻿﻿
 
Showing empathy and engaging in helpful actions, whether it’s donating to a charity or writing a supportive note to a friend, can increase your feelings of social connectedness.
 
So while you may be keeping your physical distance from others to prevent the spread of the virus, it doesn’t mean you need to be emotionally distant. Show concern and stay connected to the people in your life.
 
Consider some of the ways that the pandemic has affected your life. Are you working from home or on paid leave? Are your kids out due to school closures? Do you have plenty of food in your pantry and freezer?
 
Now think about how others might answer those same questions depending on their situation and circumstances. Many people have lost their jobs and are out of work, others have no choice but to continue working. Some people are worried about how to find childcare as they continue to work, and many may be struggling to find or pay for basic necessities.
 Empathy and understanding are a critical part of compassion and, more importantly, action. Think of others and look for ways that you can help. 
Take it easy on yourself and others. It’s OK if you aren’t managing to do it all. It’s OK if your kids are watching a little too much tv or if you aren’t keeping up on your usual routines. It’s a lot to deal with and everyone copes with stress, anxiety, and fear differently. Cut yourself some slack and practice self-compassion.
 
Working parents are struggling to manage kids who are home all day now that many schools have closed. Not only is the work situation unsettled, but parents are also trying to help kids with distance learning.
 
Those working in healthcare and finance are busier than ever. Not only are they dealing with the stress of being on the front line of a public health crisis, but they may also be struggling to find someone to watch their own kids while they are at work.
 
We all have our own anxieties, but that doesn't mean we should lose our kindness in the face of a crisis.
 
Sometimes we may be quick to criticize others without making the effort to understand how their situation and experiences are impacting their choices. Yes, it’s easy to lob criticism at others in a time of crisis, particularly those who don’t seem to be taking the situation seriously. Try to remember that everyone copes differently. People may also feel overwhelmed by conflicting information from news sources and social media. 
 
While you cannot control how others behave, you can control your own actions and do your part by sharing health information from legitimate sources. Ask others to observe your desire for physical distance and try to gently encourage friends and family to stay home, wash their hands frequently, practice social distancing, and self-isolate if they experience symptoms. 
 
In the midst of something that seems overwhelming, helping others can provide a sense of control and empowerment. When the world feels unpredictable and chaotic, finding tangible ways to do good and make things better for someone else can be a source of comfort.
 Stay home. One of the best things you can do to support others is to simply stay home. Follow the guidelines outlined by the CDC. Avoid groups, stay home as much as possible, and practice social distancing. Staying out of the way helps prevent the spread of the virus, which helps ensure that healthcare professionals and resources are not overwhelmed. 
Some other ways that you can practice empathy:
 Empathy is always important, but it is particularly vital during a public health crisis. Practicing empathy during the COVID-19 pandemic not only opens your mind to what others are experiencing, but it can also provide social connectedness that can help combat feelings of isolation. During a large-scale event, it is important to remember that everyone is in this together—think of others, reach out however you can, and remember to ask for help if you need it.

(From Verywell Health) Free Printable Coloring Pages For Adults (From The Spruce) There are many benefits to practicing empathy—especially during a global pandemic. In addition to helping you connect with others, being empathetic also helps you regulate your emotions in times of stress. You can build empathy by engaging meaningfully with others, being aware of other people's needs, and being kind to others and yourself. While you can put empathy into action by donating your time or money, in the midst of a global pandemic, one of the most valuable ways to help others is by staying home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. If you are in a financial position where you can stay home, look for ways that you can support others who may be struggling. Offer to help neighbors who may not be able to leave home to get the things that they need. Shopping for groceries and household items or ordering extra items from online delivery or pickup services are good examples of ways you can offer tangible assistance. Don’t panic buy. If you are overbuying items you are making it more difficult for others to find what they need. Donate non-perishable goods to food pantries. Put together care packages for healthcare workers, elderly neighbors, or those whose jobs have been affected. Purchase gift certificates from restaurants and small businesses that have been affected.",coronavirus covid pandemic lead sweep change disruptions nearly every aspect daily life mandate guidelines change time easy feel overwhelm anxieties important practice empathy time others well many benefit practice empathy empathize others help feel less lonely connect also increase likelihood people reach help others need addition boost social connectedness increase help behaviors empathize others also improve ability regulate emotions time stress feel empathy allow better manage anxiety experience without feel overwhelm stay update detail timeline coronavirus covid case accord cdc people empathetic nature plenty things cultivate empathy skills research also show empathy emotional skill learn listen others engage act service observe empathetic action others imagine another person situation strategies help build empathy things try stay empathetic even feel like stay touch people difficult ever time people practice social distance self isolation quarantine easy turn inward focus solely family unit research suggest care others one best ways fight feel isolation show empathy engage helpful action whether donate charity write supportive note friend increase feel social connectedness may keep physical distance others prevent spread virus mean need emotionally distant show concern stay connect people life consider ways pandemic affect life work home pay leave kid due school closure plenty food pantry freezer think others might answer question depend situation circumstances many people lose job work others choice continue work people worry find childcare continue work many may struggle find pay basic necessities empathy understand critical part compassion importantly action think others look ways help take easy others manage kid watch little much keep usual routines lot deal everyone cop stress anxiety fear differently cut slack practice self compassion work parent struggle manage kid home day many school close work situation unsettle parent also try help kid distance learn work healthcare finance busier ever deal stress front line public health crisis may also struggle find someone watch kid work anxieties mean lose kindness face crisis sometimes may quick criticize others without make effort understand situation experience impact choices yes easy lob criticism others time crisis particularly seem take situation seriously try remember everyone cop differently people may also feel overwhelm conflict information news source social media control others behave control action part share health information legitimate source ask others observe desire physical distance try gently encourage friends family stay home wash hand frequently practice social distance self isolate experience symptoms midst something seem overwhelm help others provide sense control empowerment world feel unpredictable chaotic find tangible ways good make things better someone else source comfort stay home one best things support others simply stay home follow guidelines outline cdc avoid group stay home much possible practice social distance stay way help prevent spread virus help ensure healthcare professionals resources overwhelm ways practice empathy empathy always important particularly vital public health crisis practice empathy covid pandemic open mind others experience also provide social connectedness help combat feel isolation large scale event important remember everyone together think others reach however remember ask help need manage anxiety coronavirus support love one affect coronavirus cop loneliness covid pandemic talk kid coronavirus verywell family stock emergency food pantry verywell fit protocol quarantine verywell health free printable color page adults spruce many benefit practice empathy especially global pandemic addition help connect others empathetic also help regulate emotions time stress build empathy engage meaningfully others aware people need kind others put empathy action donate time money midst global pandemic one valuable ways help others stay home prevent spread covid financial position stay home look ways support others may struggle offer help neighbor may able leave home get things need shop groceries household items order extra items online delivery pickup service good examples ways offer tangible assistance panic buy overbuying items make difficult others find need donate non perishable goods food pantries put together care package healthcare workers elderly neighbor whose job affect purchase gift certificate restaurants small businesses affect
"
Social distancing is the best tool to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Unfortunately, not everyone seems to be on the same page when it comes to maintaining physical distance during the pandemic.
 
While many people are hunkered down at home and doing what they can to maintain a safe social distance when they do have to venture out in public, others are still insisting on socializing in big groups or throwing parties, while ignoring other people's concerns.
 
Many people are struggling to have conversations with aging parents and grandparents who are still going out and doing all the social things they normally do, even though they are one of the groups most at risk of complications.
 
It can be even more difficult to convince young adults and teens that while they may not have a high risk of complications, they can still become vectors and spread the virus to those who are vulnerable.
 
So what can you do to gently and lovingly encourage your loved ones to follow social distancing guidelines for their own health? And how can you get others to respect you and your family’s personal space during this time? While you can’t control what others are doing, there are steps that you can take to encourage your loved ones to engage in social distancing.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Let your friends and family know that you are social distancing. The first step is to communicate with people in your social circle about your desire to maintain physical distance during the epidemic.
 
Hopefully, your loved ones will respect your wishes and follow suit in their own lives. But don’t expect everyone to know exactly what those guidelines are. Be specific about what you are doing and what you expect from others.
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that those with a higher risk of complications from COVID-19 are older adults and people of any age who have a serious underlying medical condition.﻿﻿ This includes individuals with asthma. Because COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, it can cause asthma attacks and may cause respiratory distress and pneumonia.
 
Remind your loved ones that social distancing can make a difference in minimizing the spread of the virus. By limiting their physical contact with others, people can reduce the number of infections and protect individuals who may be the most susceptible to serious complications.
 Remind your loved ones that social distancing can make a difference in minimizing the spread of the virus. By limiting their physical contact with others, people can reduce the number of infections and protect individuals who may be the most susceptible to serious complications, and reduce the uptick in cases overall. 
It might be tempting to inundate others with facts, figures, and projections, but appealing to logic isn’t always the most effective approach. Certainly reminding people about the CDC’s current recommendations for social distancing is helpful—but being aware of the recommendations doesn’t always mean that people will follow them.
 Appeal to their desire to protect those they love. While some people may not feel that they face a significant risk from the virus, try reminding them that there are people that they know and love who do face serious risk. 
While people might not have a high personal risk, they can probably think of a family member, friend, co-worker, or person in their community who may be more susceptible to serious complications from COVID-19. Having a personal connection can make the risk seem much more real than seemingly abstract statistics.
 
Social pressure can influence behavior in powerful ways. While we often think of it in the negative context of peer pressure, it can also be used to help people change and adopt healthier behaviors.﻿﻿ 
 
Some ways that social pressure can help people adopt social distancing:
 
It is often easier to go along with something when you can easily see examples where others are doing the same thing. While this kind of peer pressure can also lead to risky behaviors, it can also be used to encourage others to engage in actions that are in the best interest of individual and public health.
 Your friends and family may be more likely to observe social distancing in their own lives if it feels like everyone they know is doing the same. 
It might seem silly to be sharing handwashing and social distancing memes in the middle of a serious pandemic, but it may actually make people more likely to engage in those behaviors.
 
When people see that many others in their social groups are following these practices, it can help build a sense of social identity and encourage people to adhere to these public health recommendations. 
 
One important note—while it’s fun to share memes about song lyrics you can recite while washing your hands or funny pictures about social distancing, there are certain types of things you should avoid sharing with your social networks. Don’t share information from dubious or biased sources or anything that promotes unsubstantiated health claims. Stick to trusted sources such as the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) for health guidelines.
 
Support and encourage your loved ones who are social distancing—or trying their best to follow the guidelines. Remember that distancing, isolation, and quarantine can be harder on some people than it is on others, and some people may not be able to engage in it to the same degree due to the nature of their jobs, particularly those who work in grocery stores and healthcare settings. 
 Show your support to your loved ones during this time. Call them. Text them often. Plan regular Facetime calls or online chats so that they are able to still feel connected to the people that they love. Ask them how they’re doing and if there is anything they need. 
It’s not always an easy conversation to have and your unique circumstances can play a role. You might be taking precautions, but your roommates might not. Your kids might follow social distancing when they are home with you, but not when they are visiting your ex. It’s not easy, and it might be impossible for some individuals to follow the guidelines perfectly. The key is to do what you can. 
 It is important to remember that while you cannot control what others are doing, your own individual actions can play an important role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Talk to your loved ones about the essential role that they can play in preventing the spread of the virus by practicing social distancing. Even if others aren’t on the same page, let them know that you will be distancing yourself and your family and that you expect them to respect your space during this time.  The Dos and Don'ts of Social Distancing How to Practice Empathy During the COVID-19 Pandemic How to Be a Good Quarantine Partner How to Talk to Your Kids About Coronavirus (From Verywell Family) Free Online Fitness Classes (From Verywell Fit) What Are Coronavirus Scams (From Lifewire) Despite the fact that social distancing is essential to stopping the spread of COVID-19, many people continue to ignore the social distancing orders put in place to keep them safe.

"
Like millions of other Americans, you might find yourself out of work right now during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike other situations where a lay-off may have been somewhat expected, this came as a sudden and devastating blow for many.
 
And there aren’t many answers about when this will end, what will happen to the future of work, and what sort of assistance will be available to unemployed and under-employed workers.
 
Programs and policies about benefits and paid leave are just beginning to unfold—at the same time that many businesses are being forced to shut their doors indefinitely.
 
It can be a scary, stressful time for many reasons. And if you have to worry about how to get by financially, the added stress may cause you to feel completely overwhelmed.
 
If you’re jobless and anxious right now, you’re not alone. Fortunately, there are many things you can do to address both your financial situation and your mental health, so you can make the best decisions for you and your family during this difficult time.
 
If you have sick leave at the office, you should be able to use it now. You may also be eligible for disability, unemployment, or family medical leave. The rules vary by state, and laws continue to unfold as the government scrambles to figure out how to address the pandemic.
 
If you have a regular employer, check with your HR department first. Inquire about any benefits and paid leave you may be eligible for.
 
If you’re self-employed, you may not have as many options. But you may still be eligible for some benefits. You can learn more about the benefits available to you by accessing your state government’s website.
 
You may also be eligible for a small business loan. You can apply for a low-interest loan if you need cash to keep your business afloat.
 
Don’t be afraid to use any community resources available as well. Many cities and towns are providing free lunches to children as well as other programs to ensure families are getting through this tough time.
 
If there isn’t enough money to go around, you may not be able to make all of your payments. So it’s important to prioritize which bills you’re going to pay first.
 If you’re someone who has always prided themselves on paying their bills on time, not being able to make payments may feel overwhelming and scary. But, remember that right now, the usual rules don’t apply. When you’re in an emergency situation like this, you’ll need to do things a little differently.  
Take care of your basic needs first—food, shelter, utilities, clothing, and transportation. Just keep in mind that you need to focus on necessities. Don’t order takeout or delivery right now if you can help it. Buy food from the grocery store.
 
Your clothing needs should also be minimal when everyone in the family is at home. Of course, if you’re thinking of applying for new jobs, you may need something to wear to an interview. Just resist the urge to engage in any retail therapy in hopes of helping you feel better. It’ll only backfire in the long run.
 
Keep an eye on rules about rent and mortgage payments. Some states are implementing programs that prevent evictions during the pandemic.
 
Some locations are also addressing utility issues. Your lights and water might not be shut off due to your inability to pay. Check with your local regulations to see if they are offering any type of relief to people who are out of work.
 
Develop a list of the order in which you need to cover your bills and basic expenses. Keep in mind you may need to let your credit card bills wait, or you may need to forgo the cable bill. Those things can wait until you have more financial security.
 
This doesn’t mean you should just ignore your bills, however. Contact the companies, and explain your situation. They may be able to assist you while you are out of work.
 
Many banks, credit cards, and other financial institutions are offering assistance. They may forgo late fees or allow you to pay less. Contact your institution to talk about any relief programs you may be eligible for.
 
It’s not clear how long the pandemic will last or how long jobs will be affected. You may want to begin looking for alternative sources of income.
 Some companies are desperate to hire workers right now. Grocery stores, delivery companies, and online learning companies are scrambling to hire people to help them keep up with demand. 
You might also look for opportunities to join the “gig economy.” Whether you have graphic design skills, or you’ve got some editing skills, there are many ways to earn extra cash from home.
 
You might also look at things you can sell. With slower shipping and few stores open, people may be more willing to pay for items you have sitting around the house. It may be a good time to clean out your closets, sort through those boxes, and get rid of any items you don’t need anymore. 
 
If it’s something that is best to sell local, like furniture, turn to social media to list your items. If it’s something that might sell anywhere in the United States, consider listing on eBay or a similar type of site.
 
Many studies have linked financial distress to poorer mental health.﻿﻿ The more you stress about money, the harder it may be to manage your psychological well-being—and vice versa.
 
In addition to worrying about money right now, the stress of unemployment, the sudden disruption of your routine, and the uncertainty of the future are additional factors that may affect your psychological well-being.
 
So it’s important to manage your mental health the best you can during this stressful time. Here are some steps you can take to stay as mentally healthy as possible.
 
It would be easy to neglect yourself right now. But an unhealthy diet, poor sleep, and a lack of leisure time will only compound your stress. Do your best to take care of your mind and body.
 
Make caring for yourself a high priority, so you have plenty of energy to tackle the problems you’re facing.
 
Many of your go-to coping strategies may not be available to you right now—like going to the gym or having coffee with friends. So it’s important to identify what coping strategies you can use to manage your stress level.
 
You may need to get a little creative. A virtual coffee hour with your friends via video chat might be in order. You may find listening to a meditation app helps as well. But you won’t know unless you try.
 
Experiment with a variety of coping skills until you discover what works best for you. But be on the lookout for coping strategies that create bigger long-term problems. Avoid overeating or turning to alcohol, for example, as these can both create new problems for you.
 
Research shows exercise is important to mental health. It can boost your happiness and help keep depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues at bay.
 
A 2018 study published in The Lancet Psychiatry found that 45 minutes of exercise three to five times per week was associated with the biggest mental health benefits.﻿﻿
 
Walking, running, strength training, and yoga are just a few ways you might get some physical activity right now. If you can safely exercise outdoors, it may be especially good for your mental health. But if you can’t, then get some physical activity inside your home.
 
You can find plenty of workouts on social media. Right now, many fitness trainers are offering online classes that are meant to be done at home with little or no equipment.
 
You might also check out apps, courses, or other online training programs that will help you be active at home.
 
Without a job, you might feel a bit lost about what to do with your time. And if you’re not careful, you could end up wasting endless hours watching TV or scrolling through social media.
 Having a consistent schedule can help you feel your best. Create a schedule that will help you find time to do the things you need to do—like make phone calls, update your resume, apply for benefits, and manage your budget. 
Make sure to include plenty of time to take care of yourself and participate in some leisure activities. Participating in activities that boost your mood every once in a while can help you feel better—and help you do better.
 
You may also want to limit the amount of time you spend consuming media right now. The more you watch news stories that recount death tolls and make catastrophic predictions, the more anxious you’ll feel. You might feel better if you commit to only checking the news two times per day, rather than allowing yourself to be exposed to it all day long.
 
Feeling your best requires you to devote time to the problems you’re facing as well as how you’re feeling about those problems.
 
Be sure to set aside time to address your financial problems or to look for a job in the future. Getting things done will help you feel better.
 
When you find yourself worrying about things, focus on looking for a solution instead of dwelling on the problem.
 
When you’re struggling with emotions, like anxiety and sadness, it can be helpful to talk to someone. Whether you call your friend who is in a similar predicament, or you reach out to your mother to talk about concerns, emotional support can help you gain strength during this stressful time.
 
Just make sure you aren’t complaining or making catastrophic predictions. And don’t invest a lot of time into talking to people who are. Those sorts of conversations will only fuel your anxiety.
 
Instead, talk about how you feel and the action steps you’re going to take.
 If you’re struggling to manage your anxiety to the point that it’s difficult to function, seek professional help. You might call your physician to get a referral to a mental health professional, or you can check out a directory to find a local therapist. 
Many therapists aren’t seeing patients in person right now, however. So you might opt for online therapy. There are many apps and websites devoted to online treatment that allow you to message, video chat, or speak with a licensed mental health professional over the phone.
 During this state of emergency, you may need to do whatever you can to get through. If you can’t pay your bills, don’t panic. Work on balancing your time between solving your problems and managing how you feel about your problems. Managing your mental health right now may seem like a difficult task. But staying mentally well can be key to helping you get through this pandemic the best way you can. Focus on the things you can control (like doing things that can help you stay as healthy as possible) and commit less time to things you can’t control, like the state of the economy. 
There are many resources available to individuals in specific areas or to workers in certain industries. It’s important to look for any that may specifically help you. In the meantime, here are some general resources that may help a variety of people who are financially impacted by the COVID-19:

There’s a lot of advice being offered right now about how to keep yourself physically healthy during the coronavirus pandemic such as washing your hands, and practicing social distancing.
 
But managing mental health during this time is just as vital to your overall well-being. So while it is happening, take steps to address your psychological well-being as well. If you’re not proactive about taking care of your mind and emotions during this time, you may notice a decline in mental health.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
There are many ways and reasons the coronavirus pandemic may take a toll on your mental health. Being aware of the factors that might affect your well-being can help you take steps to combat these issues.
 
Fear of catching the virus and worrying about how you’re going to pay the bills are just two of the stresses of the situation that can make it difficult to function.
 
You may have to deal with a variety of practical problems—from figuring out childcare issues to determining how to keep your small business afloat. And you are also likely dealing with a lot of uncertainty.
 
There are many unknowns about the virus. Your day-to-day life may be changing rapidly as regulations and recommendations continue to roll out regarding social contact.
 
Many people are working from home while also having their children at home right now. And most social gatherings and events have been canceled (although laws vary a bit by city and state).
 No matter where you live, your routine has likely been disrupted in some way. Having less structure, a changing schedule, and complete uncertainty about how long this will last can take a toll on your mental health. 
Staying inside for extended periods of time can cause you to feel a bit restless. For some people it causes anxiety. For others staying indoors causes boredom. If left unaddressed, these emotions can lead to a decline in mental health.
 
For most people, the coronavirus pandemic means a lot less social contact. Some are separated from family members and co-workers. Others live alone and aren’t able to see anyone face-to-face.
 
While some may be able to use social media, phone calls, and video chats to stay connected, not everyone has people they can reach out to in this way. And since social interaction is vital for good mental health, less contact can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety.
 
Whether you normally walk a half-mile to get on the train, or you have a job that involves a fair amount of physical labor, there’s a good chance your current work situation may not require you to move as much as you usually do.
 
Many gyms have closed (either voluntarily or due to local regulations) in an effort to support social distancing. So there may be fewer opportunities to work out—which may have been one of your most accessible coping skills.
 
If you previously had depression, anxiety, or another mental illness, your symptoms may intensify during stressful times. And even if your mental health was good prior to the pandemic, you may notice new symptoms emerging.
 
It’s important to remember that people aren’t either “mentally healthy” or “mentally ill.” Mental health is a continuum. And at any given moment, you might find yourself shifting up or down the continuum based on what’s going on around you.
 
Here are some warning signs that might indicate a decline in your mental health:
 
You might feel like you’re on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster right now. Whether you’re more irritable, sad, or anxious than usual, these emotions should be expected.
 However, bigger shifts in your mood might be the sign of something more serious. If you’re struggling to manage your emotions, or if your emotions are making it difficult to function, it can be a sign that you may need to address your mental health. 
Stress can also interfere with sleep. You might find you’re not able to fall asleep or that you wake up repeatedly throughout the night. On the flip side, you might find you’re sleeping too much. Maybe you nap throughout the day and have trouble waking in the morning despite a full night’s rest.
 
Getting too much or too little sleep are both signs of mental illness. But these issues can also be the cause of a negative impact on your psychological well-being. So both issues may need to be addressed simultaneously.
 
Distress can cause some people to eat too much. Others lose their appetites altogether. If you’re experiencing a major change in appetite or in weight, it could be a sign your distress is too high.
 
You might find you have more difficulty concentrating, staying on task, and being productive. And while the change in your routine may make these things more difficult, poor mental health can also be a factor.
 
If you’re having trouble taking care of your daily needs—taking a shower, doing household chores, or caring for your kids—it might be a sign that you may need to take serious steps to improve your psychological well-being.
 
Fortunately, there are steps you can take to improve your mental health right now even if you’re social distancing. Despite ongoing uncertainty of the situation, take small steps every day to address your emotional needs.
 
Research﻿﻿ clearly shows that physical activity is a vital component of good mental health. Consider how you can still get exercise right now, and incorporate it into your daily routine.
 
You can find plenty of at-home workout programs that will help you stay active. There are many free apps, videos, and fitness communities that can help you exercise if you don’t have any equipment.
 
Depending on where you live—as well as on the current laws and recommendations in your area—you may be able to get outside to exercise as well. If it’s safe to do so, go for a walk, hike through the woods, or run on some trails.
 
But you don’t need a lot of space to exercise if you don’t have it. You can still work out from your living room or bedroom with little or no equipment at all.
 
It may sound counterintuitive to schedule time for worry. After all, you may think you are already worrying too much about the state of affairs.
 
But research ﻿﻿ shows that scheduling time to worry can be an effective way to contain it to a limited time period. Rather than worry all day long, you might find you can contain anxious thoughts to only 15 minutes.
 
Here’s how it works:
 
Researchers have found that people who consistently practice this technique are able to reduce overall anxiety. Additionally, they’re able to focus more and stay on task better throughout the rest of the day.
 
Even when you can’t physically be around people, you can still remain connected to friends, family, and community.
 
You may find solace in connecting with your loved ones or even strangers during this time. And there are many ways to reach out and get connected.
 
If you don’t have anyone to reach out to, look for online groups who are currently supporting one another. You might find these groups through social media or online forums.
 
Keep in mind you can always offer to start a group as well. There are likely many other people who would appreciate some support from you—whether it means phone calls to check-in, daily emails, or video chats.
 
Although things may feel really stressful right now, the pandemic won’t last forever. So try to keep the big picture in mind.
 Someday, you’ll likely be recounting what you did during the pandemic. Maybe you’ll be telling the story of how you survived social distancing or how you managed to get through this time financially. 
But at some point restrictions will end, and many of the issues you’re stressing out about right now won’t be problems anymore. Keeping this in mind will help you keep things in perspective.
 
While it’s important to stay informed, consuming constant content about the coronavirus can keep you in a heightened state of distress. The media continuously reports on new cases of the virus and talks about death tolls which can greatly affect your psychological well-being.
 
Here are some healthy ways to stay informed while also managing your media consumption:
 
There are many things outside of your control during a pandemic. And thinking about all of these things won’t do any good.
 
It’s important to focus on the things you can control, such as the measures you’re undergoing to keep yourself and your family safe and healthy.
 
Reducing unnecessary social contact, washing your hands, and working on managing your finances are just a few of these things. You can also control how well you take care of yourself, how often you talk to friends and family, and how much media you consume.
 
You may not have access to many of the coping techniques that typically help you handle stress—like going to the gym or having coffee with a friend. So it’s important to think about the healthy coping skills you’ll use when you’re hit with moments of overwhelming anxiety or you begin to feel sad.
 Explore new skills you can practice, such as writing in a journal. You might also discover a meditation app or one that helps you practice a variety of relaxation techniques and stress relievers like progressive muscle relaxation. 
Also, be on the lookout for any unhealthy coping skills you might be trying to rely on to give you comfort such as food or alcohol. These types of strategies can backfire and cause you to feel worse in the long run.
 
If you’re experiencing a decline in mental health that has you concerned, or your strategies aren’t working to improve your mood, then seek support.
 
You might call your physician to explain what you’re going through. You may also reach out to a local mental health professional. But keep in mind some of them may be limiting their face-to-face contact with patients at this time.
 
You can also try online therapy. Talking to a licensed mental health professional via phone, video chat, or messaging could help improve your mental health and reduce your stress at a time when social distancing is encouraged.
 Make your mental health a top priority during times of high stress and uncertainty. You may find that a few proactive measures will help you to feel much better. But if you don’t feel like your strategies are working, then reach out to a professional. Talking to someone could be the key to helping you manage your distress during this pandemic. Coping With Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic What Is Social Distancing? How to Transition To Online Therapy Free Online Fitness Classes (From Verywell Fit) What to Do in a Pandemic (From Verywell Health) Free Printable Coloring Pages For Adults (From The Spruce) Stress, disrupted routines, cabin fever, lack of social contact, and reduced physical activity due to coronavirus can all impact your mental health. It’s important to recognize the warning signs of stress so you can take action and get the help you need. A few small steps can make big improvements in your mental health, including daily exercise, scheduling a worry time, journal writing, maintaining social connections, and monitoring media consumption. Schedule a worrying time. Pick a 15-minute timeframe to sit and worry. Worry during your worrying time. Write in a journal, talk to someone about it, or just think about all the things you have to worry about. Stop worrying when your time is up. When your time ends, get up, and do an activity that distracts you from those worries. Defer worrisome thoughts to your worrying time. When you find yourself worrying outside of your scheduled time, remind yourself it’s not time yet and that you’ll worry about it later. Use social media to chat with relatives and friends Post supportive comments, pictures, and content on your social sites Schedule regular video chats with friends, family members, and co-workers Send mail to your loved ones. A card, handwritten letter, or small note can do a lot to lift other people’s spirits Join online forums and groups that allow you to speak to people in your community Attend online church or spiritual meetings if it's aligned with your belief system. Be supportive of others who may need social connection Don’t keep the TV on news channels. While you may want to become aware of any breaking reports, keeping the TV tuned into news stations isn’t good for you. Commit to only tuning in to a few news programs per day, and set a time limit (such as 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening) Be mindful of your social media time. Scrolling through social media mindlessly throughout the day can drain you of mental strength as well. So pay attention to the time you’re putting into it as it can greatly affect your mental health. Follow people who inspire you on social media. If you follow people who are making catastrophic predictions and complaining about their situations, you will likely become distressed. Make sure you follow people who are more invested in helping, inspiring, and staying positive. Be selective with the content you consume. Read articles and watch programs that focus on what you can do to stay healthy, not what organizations are doing wrong.",lot advice offer right keep physically healthy coronavirus pandemic wash hand

Do you know someone affected by coronavirus and are you wondering how best to support them during this time? Perhaps this person isn't answering the phone or you know that they are struggling. While you obviously can't physically be there for someone who is quarantined or currently infected with coronavirus, you surely still feel concerned and aren't sure how to help.
 
We're here to tell you that your worries are completely valid, especially during this stressful time when social distancing and self-quarantine are quickly becoming a new normal. In a 2012 study published in Comprehensive Psychiatry about the impact of SARS on mental health, it was found that being quarantined increased the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms three years later.﻿﻿
 
In addition, those with a pre-existing health problem such as an anxiety disorder were shown to be at greater risk for negative psychological outcomes of self-quarantine. Specifically, not having a normal routine and lack of physical and social contact with others evidently led to feelings of isolation, frustration, and boredom.
 
For these reasons, the best thing you can do is to think outside the box about how to offer your support from a distance. Below are some ideas of ways to help someone living with coronavirus (or actively avoiding it) while staying safe yourself.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
Perhaps the easiest first step is to reach out directly and make a phone call to see how the person is doing. You may wish to stay in contact more frequently than usual, to keep in touch, and to prevent the person from feeling isolated.
 If you wish to have a bit more contact than you can get through a regular phone call, you could also consider video chatting through an app like Facetime, depending on how comfortable the person is with technology. 
If you've made several phone calls that haven't been returned and you are truly concerned for the safety of your friend or loved one, you could consider calling for emergency assistance to check on them.
 
If your friend or loved one does talk with you on the phone, the best thing you can do is to provide a listening ear. Just being there to listen and offer support could be the most important thing that you do during this time.
 
Ask what you can do to help, but also consider offering to do specific tasks or to drop off specific items. Do they have a dog that needs walking or other outdoor household chores you could handle? It could be that the person is overwhelmed mentally, and unable to think of what they need in the moment or afraid to be a burden on you.
 
A person affected by coronavirus may not have had time to stock up on necessary supplies or food to last for the quarantine period. You could consider preparing a few healthy freezer meals or doing a porch drop-off of a bag of fresh groceries.
 
Healthy foods like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits along with pantry staples with a long shelf-life are the smartest choices. Other items that you could include might be laundry detergent, soap, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper (if store stock permits). Just make sure that you are doing a contact-less drop-off to avoid spreading potential contamination.
 
Where would we be in the middle of a pandemic without social media? If your friend or loved one is on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat, stay in touch with them by sharing photos or updates.
 
The best approach to social media at this time will be to balance positivity with reality. A person who is already in quarantine or isolation due to coronavirus doesn't need to be told to ""stay home."" That person needs social connection and support more than anything at this time.
 
Particularly if your friend or loved one is in the older adult category (65+), they may appreciate receiving a letter or card through the postal service. A handwritten card is something that they can tuck away to read again and again when they need to feel supported or are struggling with feeling isolated.
 
If you can't physically go out yourself to drop off groceries or other supplies to your friend or loved one, another option might be to arrange deliveries.
 
That might include local deliveries of groceries, personal care needs, and medications, or it could even mean deliveries from Amazon of books, magazines, etc. or other items to help them pass the time.
 
You could also check to see if any delivery services have sprung up in your community, such as neighbors helping each other or certain community groups offering to make deliveries to those in quarantine.
 
Tapping into the local community of your friend or loved one is one way to do this, either by looking for local Facebook groups or contacting anyone in the area that you know.
 
One way to stay socially connected might be to suggest a shared activity that will keep you in regular contact. Examples might include reading one chapter of a book each day and talking about it online, writing together in an online journal, or watching a particular movie at the same time and texting or instant messaging about your favorite parts.
 
Other ideas might include watching Netflix series together, playing online games against each other, or listening to the same audiobooks. Doing a shared activity gives the person something to do and it gives you a reason to stay in regular contact with them.
 
While you don't want to make someone who is isolated feel more alarmed than necessary about the situation of the world, being a source of reliable information could help to dispel any myths that they may be subject to through social media.
 
This means keeping yourself informed by listening to reputable sources of information such as large news agencies, public health organizations, and government advisories.
 
Those faced with quarantine are more likely to feel distressed if they have unclear information and communication, which can be the case during the outbreak of a pandemic. Do what you can to minimize the impact of these issues by passing on as much reliable information as you feel comfortable sharing at this time.
 
While it may feel uncomfortable asking about money, if you know your friend or loved one might be facing financial pressures or living paycheck to paycheck without an emergency fund, it may be wise to check up on their financial health.
 
If you are in a position to help financially, that could be an option to temporarily ease their burden. Depending on how well you know the person, you could also offer to help them organize their finances or pay bills to relieve their mental burden and help where you can.
 
Having a regular daily routine during isolation or quarantine is likely to help the person's mental health and mood. Getting enough sleep, getting regular exercise, and going to bed at a certain hour each night are just as important during isolation as they are at other times.
 If you feel as though your friend or loved one is struggling to maintain feelings of normalcy, try to help them establish something of a routine to carry them through their period of isolation or quarantine. 
If you are feeling lost about how best to support the psychological health of others through a pandemic, Johns Hopkins University is offering free online psychological first aid training through the Coursera platform that can help you prepare for how to best support your loved ones. If you have concerns about the psychological well-being of your loved one, you could also look into online therapy or chat-based support.
 
Also, remember to take care of your own mental health during this difficult time. This may mean making extra time for self-care activities, even though it feels like that is the last thing you have time for. Keep up your exercise, get enough sleep, take vitamins, eat healthy, practice meditation, and generally amp up what you would normally do when going through a stressful period of life or a transition.
 While it is inevitable that many people will experience negative psychological impacts of coronavirus, there are steps you can take to support a loved one who has been impacted. In its most basic sense, this means listening with compassion, being present, and taking cues from the other person about what you can do to best offer your support and care at this time. It can be difficult to know how to help a loved one with coronavirus when you are unable to visit them or be physically close by. There are ways that you can help someone with coronavirus without putting yourself at risk.

Are you unsure how to cope with loneliness during the coronavirus pandemic? You could be self-isolating because you've caught the infection, but there are many other reasons why you've elected to stay indoors.
 
Whether you are quarantined due to suspected exposure, staying home because you are in a high-risk category, or at home to help prevent the spread of infection, you may find yourself unprepared for the feelings of loneliness that will likely follow.
 
While those with chronic illness may already be familiar with what it's like to face long periods of time alone at home, most of us are used to getting out daily; even those who are retired or don't work usually make trips to run errands or visit friends. To have all of that stop suddenly is jarring, to say the least.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
A 2017 systematic review of 40 studies from 1950 to 2016 published in the journal Public Health found a significant association between social isolation and loneliness and poorer mental health outcomes as well as all-cause mortality.﻿﻿
 
For this reason, it's important to take care of your mental health during times of decreased social interactions.
 
It's normal to feel stress when faced with staying indoors and interacting less with people, especially when that is added to the underlying stress of worrying whether you will catch the virus. These factors could increase your chances of developing a mental health issue, like anxiety or depression.
 
While social distancing refers to avoiding large gatherings of people, staying a certain distance from others in public, and only going out of the house for essentials, it can still start to feel a lot like ""cabin fever."" You might also feel stigmatized if you are isolated because you've contracted the virus or you suspect you may have contracted the virus.
 
What's the best way to get through this period of isolation? There are many strategies that you can employ to ensure your well-being and good mental health. Most of these involve either finding ways to distract yourself (keep busy) or finding ways to connect with others (despite the circumstances).
 Distraction works to help you avoid ruminating about everything that is wrong, which is a risk factor for becoming depressed. In this way, taking on little projects or finding other forms of distraction can help to keep your mood level. 
In contrast, staying social in non-traditional ways can help you to feel less isolated and combat loneliness.
 
If you are unable to go places or interact socially with many people at this time, you might be wondering what you can do. Below are some ideas on how to manage your feelings of loneliness during these times.
 
Even if you are isolated at home, try to keep to a regular schedule as much as possible. While loneliness can feel like it will never end, trying to make these days feel as ""normal"" as possible will help you to get through.
 
Start each day with a plan of a few things that you will do, keep a daily diary about how you are feeling and what you are doing, and keep a symptom log if you are managing illness. All of these tracking systems will help you to feel like you are being proactive about the situation.
 
In a 2020 study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, an online survey of 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China showed that people who had up to date health information and advice on precautionary measures had better psychological functioning and resilience.﻿﻿
 
While you do not want to feed your anxiety and fear through constant updates about the state of the virus, keeping up to date on the latest advice and health information may give you an edge when it comes to protecting your mental health (and as a result, reducing the impact of loneliness).
 
Limit your media consumption to an extent. Watching too much news, reading too many articles, and consuming too much content can be overwhelming. You might decide to check the news twice a day. Or you might decide to limit your time on social media if everyone is talking about the virus. Make sure you seek sites that give factual information about what you can do to stay healthy, such as the CDC and WHO.
 
While it's easy to focus exclusively on how to manage your mental health and loneliness directly during a crisis, we sometimes forget that our physical and mental health are delicately intertwined.
 
If you spend weeks of isolation not getting any exercise, this will have a detrimental effect on your ability to cope mentally. Below are some ideas of at-home activities that you can keep doing to stay active.
 
Another contributor to feelings of loneliness can be a loss of sense of meaning. If you are finding that you feel not just bored, but also as though you are losing your sense of self, then a loss of meaning might be affecting you.
 All of us want to feel like we belong and that our life has importance, which is why incorporating meaningful activities into each day is important. Doing something meaningful each day, even if only for a short period, will give you a sense of purpose and identity. 
Only you know what will create meaning in your life, but below are some ideas to get you started:
 
Perhaps the best thing you can do to combat loneliness during this period of isolation is to connect with others in non-traditional ways. While you may not be able to visit with family and friends in person, that does not mean that you cannot connect.
 
Can you think of any out-of-the-box ways to stay in contact with friends and family? If you are comfortable using technology, there are numerous ways you can stay in touch. If you prefer more traditional ways of communicating, there are still options for you. Below are some ideas to stay in touch with your loved ones.
 
In addition to staying in touch with family and friends, you can also combat loneliness by participating in online exchanges with other people around the world. These don't need to necessarily be your online ""friends,"" but rather those with whom you share something in common and you communicate online.
 
Below are some examples of online connections that you can make.
 
Finding ways to give yourself comfort even when you are feeling lonely can help to improve your mental health. Below are some ideas of ""comfort measures"" that you can take even if you are alone.
 
There's a reason why artists enjoy becoming swept away by their work. Expressing yourself through creative means can be therapeutic, whether it involves painting, writing, dancing, etc.
 If you're finding it hard to express what you are feeling, channeling your feelings into creating something can be cathartic. In addition, when you create something you enter the ""creative magic zone,"" which can be a form of meditation in itself. 
Below are a few lists of projects that you could try.
 
If you're having trouble coming up with projects, focus on the ones that you can do with what you already have on hand. Most of us will have a notebook, paper, printer, and access to the Internet.
 
Using those few basic tools, you're sure to find something online to get you started. You could even focus on culinary arts and focus on cooking or baking projects.
 
Another way to boost your mental health is to find healthy distractions. This might come in the form of reading, watching shows, listening to music, or finding other activities that interest you. Below are some ideas to help.
 
While it might feel like this loneliness will last forever, there will come a time that you'll be back to your usual routines. One way to feel less alone now is to make plans for the future or do things that help you to focus on the future. Below are some ideas.
 
Most importantly, practice self-compassion during this difficult time. If you find yourself saying things like ""I shouldn't be feeling this way"" or pushing away difficult emotions, this will only make your loneliness persist.
 Instead of resisting your feelings, instead, find ways to be accepting of them as coming and going. This helps to take away their power and ease your unhappiness. 
Remember that your feelings will change. If you are still struggling, try practicing guided meditation following a Youtube video.
 
It might seem counterintuitive, but if you are struggling yourself, sometimes offering help to others who are feeling lonely can make you feel less lonely yourself. Make a phone call, send a text, send a letter, or comment on someone's social media posts. Be supportive and offer words of encouragement.
 
Older adults (aged 65+) may be particularly susceptible to loneliness during coronavirus. This group is most likely to self-isolate due to fear of infection, while also potentially having fewer supports in place to feel less lonely. The Baby Boomers, in particular, may be the most affected by this pandemic. Older adults can stave off loneliness during this time in the following ways:
 If you find yourself with very poor mental health while isolated during coronavirus and aren't able to pull yourself out of feelings of anxiety, depression, or fear, it is important to reach out for help. Consider calling a crisis line or an online therapy service to find out about options. While it's normal to feel afraid and lonely at a time like this, worsening mental health could indicate the need for outside help.

"
End-of-life is something most of us think about at some point. We imagine what it will be like and who will be by our side.﻿﻿ We consider our experiences and wonder if we’ve done enough and loved enough.
 
For some people, death is not feared. Yet for others, being afraid of dying alone points to a bigger fear of losing control of the dying process. This fear of losing control is compounded by the fact that many hospitals and nursing homes have implemented no-visitor policies during the coronavirus pandemic, leaving many people facing death each day without family members or loved ones by their side.
 
Thankfully, doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff are working tirelessly during the to ensure their patients don’t die alone.﻿﻿ Through the use of technology, some families are able to communicate with a loved one during their final hours. While others take comfort in knowing that their loved one is accompanied by an extraordinary healthcare worker who will sit with them until the end. For many, this helps to change the landscape of dying alone. 
 And while countless families are grateful for the support, compassion, and selflessness of the frontline workers, many are still left with unanswered questions about how their loved ones spent their final moments. This fear that a father, mother, uncle, brother, or sister died alone can complicate the grief process and lead to a lack of closure for family members. 
We talked to mental health experts to get a better understanding of why we fear the idea of dying alone and how families can find comfort and peace as they begin the grieving process.
 
To understand why we have a fear of dying alone, Litsa Williams, a clinical social worker, and co-founder and program director of What’s Your Grief?, says we first need to acknowledge that this fear often comes from death itself. “We fear the unknown, the potential pain, unfamiliarity, and discomfort that may accompany death,” she explained in an email.
 
Though we may plan well and have good palliative support, Williams says there is comfort in the idea of a familiar face, someone to watch over us to ensure suffering is minimized, someone to remind us we are loved, and simply to be present with us.
 
Another reason we fear dying alone stems from our desire for connectivity. “There is a natural human instinct to crave connectivity with others, and this instinct is even more pronounced for those that we love,” explains Keita Franklin, PhD, and chief clinical officer of Psych Hub. 
 
This desire, Franklin says, is present, and perhaps even intensified, when facing your mortality.
 For so many, the final hours of life provide an irreplaceable opportunity for the dying family member and their loved ones to express love, respect, regret, and perhaps offer forgiveness for perceived slights. 
Psychotherapist, Naomi Torres-Mackie, EdM, says that during her time providing therapy to end-of-life medical patients, she came to understand that dying alone is actually preferred by some. “This is in large part due to the fact that we may not want others see us weak or sick,” she wrote in an email. Dying alone, she says, can give someone a sense of dignity in their last moments.
 
For some, Torres-Mackie says that dying without others present means they won’t cause emotional pain for those around them. “Dying alone means that you don't have to worry about anyone else but yourself—one very last time,” she adds.
 
That said, Williams points out that in many COVID-19 situations, which are very different from previous end-of-life processes, families feel their loved one was not given the choice of dying alone. This was decided for them. And in these situations, the best families, patients, and hospital staff can do, she says, is talk to one another openly and often, discuss fears and concerns, get creative with the use of phones, tablets, video technology, photographs, audio files, music, and any other things that may provide a feeling of comfort and connection.
 
“The current pandemic facing our nation has complicated an already emotional and difficult process surrounding end-of-life considerations,” Franklin said in an email. And for the family members and loved ones dealing with this grief, knowing that nurses and hospital staff, in general, are well-trained and equipped to respond with empathy and grace during the final moments of life, can provide some sense of comfort and peace.﻿﻿
 
Williams explains there is greater comfort in this than thinking of a loved one dying alone. While it will likely be minor, she points out that in this complicated time, small comforts are sometimes all a family has.
 Talking to the hospital staff person and making sure they know your loved one as a person and not just a patient, may help a bit. 
Also, if a family can feel that their loved one is not in pain, is not suffering, and potentially not aware of what is going on, Williams says that may serve as a comfort. 
 
Through her clinical work with COVID-19 frontline workers, Torres-Mackie says she has learned that despite how difficult their jobs are, they get a great sense of meaning from accompanying people during their last moments. “It provides them with a sense of real purpose during a time when they otherwise feel pretty powerless,” she explains.
 
Healthcare workers who extend this empathy are rightly commended, but at the same time, Franklin says it does not alleviate the pain that individuals feel for not being physically present during a loved one’s final hours. “Family members may experience guilt for not being present and wonder if they could have done more,” says Franklin.
 
They may also wonder if there was something else they could or should have said to a dying loved one. With that in mind, Franklin says that these feelings of guilt and regret are a natural response to the current public health restrictions, and they must be considered during the grieving process. 
 
That’s why finding support, either with those close to you or professionally, is so critical. The National Institute on Aging says finding support with family and compassionate friends is a great place to start, especially since they are grieving too.﻿﻿
 
But if you find that managing this on your own is too much, you may want to consider grief counseling. Talking with a therapist can help you begin to accept death, work through the grieving process, and in time, move forward.﻿﻿
 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought up many fears about dying alone. Fears about our own mortality and fears about our loved ones spending their final days without family by their side. If you have concerns about end-of-life rituals or are struggling with the loss of a loved one, remember, help is available. Reach out to your doctor, a mental health professional, or bereavement expert. For many people, COVID-19 has complicated end-of-life situations. It's normal to fear dying alone and to feel the need for closure. With the help of healthcare workers and technology, loved ones have been able to say goodbye from a distance.",end life something think point imagine like side consider experience wonder enough love enough people death fear yet others afraid die alone point bigger fear lose control die process fear lose control compound fact many hospitals nurse home implement visitor policies coronavirus pandemic leave many people face death day without family members love ones side thankfully doctor nurse hospital staff work tirelessly ensure patients die alone use technology families able communicate love one final hours others take comfort know love one accompany extraordinary healthcare worker sit end many help change landscape die alone countless families grateful support compassion selflessness frontline workers many still leave unanswered question love ones spend final moments fear father mother uncle brother sister die alone complicate grief process lead lack closure family members talk mental health experts get better understand fear idea die alone families find comfort peace begin grieve process understand fear die alone litsa williams clinical social worker founder program director grief say first need acknowledge fear often come death fear unknown potential pain unfamiliarity discomfort may accompany death explain email though may plan well good palliative support williams say comfort idea familiar face someone watch ensure suffer minimize someone remind love simply present another reason fear die alone stem desire connectivity natural human instinct crave connectivity others instinct even pronounce love explain keita franklin phd chief clinical officer psych hub desire franklin say present perhaps even intensify face mortality many final hours life provide irreplaceable opportunity die family member love ones express love respect regret perhaps offer forgiveness perceive slight psychotherapist naomi torres mackie edm say time provide therapy end life medical patients come understand die alone actually prefer large part due fact may want others see weak sick write email die alone say give someone sense dignity last moments torres mackie say die without others present mean cause emotional pain around die alone mean worry anyone else one last time add say williams point many covid situations different previous end life process families feel love one give choice die alone decide situations best families patients hospital staff say talk one another openly often discuss fear concern get creative use phone tablets video technology photograph audio file music things may provide feel comfort connection current pandemic face nation complicate already emotional difficult process surround end life considerations franklin say email family members love ones deal grief know nurse hospital staff general well train equip respond empathy grace final moments life provide sense comfort peace williams explain greater comfort think love one die alone likely minor point complicate time small comfort sometimes family talk hospital staff person make sure know love one person patient may help bite also family feel love one pain suffer potentially aware williams say may serve comfort clinical work covid frontline workers torres mackie say learn despite difficult job get great sense mean accompany people last moments provide sense real purpose time otherwise feel pretty powerless explain healthcare workers extend empathy rightly commend time franklin say alleviate pain individuals feel physically present love one final hours family members may experience guilt present wonder could say franklin may also wonder something else could say die love one mind franklin say feel guilt regret natural response current public health restrictions must consider grieve process find support either close professionally critical national institute age say find support family compassionate friends great place start especially since grieve find manage much may want consider grief counsel talk therapist help begin accept death work grieve process time move forward covid pandemic bring many fear die alone fear mortality fear love ones spend final days without family side concern end life rituals struggle loss love one remember help available reach doctor mental health professional bereavement expert many people covid complicate end life situations normal fear die alone feel need closure help healthcare workers technology love ones able say goodbye distance

“Social distancing” is a term used to describe infection control actions taken by public health officials to stop or slow down the spread of a highly contagious disease. Most recently, it’s been referenced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one of the best strategies in preventing the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).﻿﻿
 
The CDC defines social distancing as ""remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible.""﻿﻿ It is less drastic than quarantine or isolation, which are used for people who are suspected to be carrying the virus.
 
While some people may find social distancing to be a big relief—canceling business-related travel to a conference may give someone peace of mind—others find it to be a major inconvenience. Most public gatherings have been canceled due to the recommendations about social distancing.
 
Clearly, social distancing may be the most effective way for people who aren’t infected with the coronavirus to avoid getting it. But it does lead to some major changes in how businesses are run, public events are held, and social interactions occur.
 
Understanding what it means, why it’s recommended, and how to practice it can help alleviate any fears you may have.
 Stay Updated: A Detailed Timeline of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Cases According to the CDC, WHO 
According to the CDC, coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person contact. It’s believed that people who are in close contact (within 6 feet of one another) are most likely to spread it. It spreads through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.﻿﻿
 
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of anyone nearby and may be inhaled into the lungs, which can spread the disease.
 While it’s believed that people who are the sickest are most likely to spread coronavirus, some people might spread it before they begin to show symptoms. That’s why it may be important to practice social distancing even with people who don’t appear ill. 
It may also be possible to contract COVID-19 through contaminated surfaces or objects. An individual who touches a surface that has the virus on it and then touches their own mouth or nose, for example, may contract the virus.
 
The CDC believes COVID-19 spreads easily throughout communities. So they have recommended social distancing as a way to help stop the spread.
 
If individuals reduce their contact with one another, people will be less likely to pass the virus on. This can be the best way to prevent what they refer to as “community spread.""
 
In many cities and states, governors have enacted shelter-in-place orders to help promote social distancing with rules like the following:
 
While the CDC isn’t recommending everyone take drastic measures like isolating themselves, they are advising people to take precautions, especially those who may be at a higher risk for contracting the disease.
 
In some cases, beach and park closures have become necessary in order to ensure that large gatherings are limited wherever possible, especially in the wake of many younger people ignoring social distancing guidelines during spring break.
 
A 2010 study published in BioMed Central (BMC) Public Health assessed whether social distancing is effective in slowing or reducing the transmission of influenza during an outbreak. Researchers found that workplace social distancing reduced the number of overall flu cases.﻿﻿
 
However, the study also discovered that the success rate was greater in areas where people practiced other preventative measures, such as more frequent handwashing and other strategies to keep their immune systems strong.
 
So, while social distancing may be an important factor in preventing the spread of coronavirus, practicing good hygiene and taking other safety precautions may also be important steps in preventing the spread.
 It’s important to remember that you may need a combination of safety methods in place to fight the spread of the disease as effectively as possible. 
You may have seen references in the news or on social media to the need to ""flatten the curve"" through social distancing. When new cases spike very quickly, hospitals and other medical facilities can be overwhelmed and unable to adequately treat everyone—including patients who are not actually dealing with the coronavirus. Such spikes are more likely when social distancing measures are not enacted quickly and early enough.
 
By slowing the number of new cases and stretching them out over a longer period of time—or ""flattening the curve"" of new cases—we can keep the number of total cases (and the number of high-risk cases) below that threshold so that our hospitals have enough space and resources to operate as smoothly as possible during this difficult time.
 
The most obvious way to practice social distancing is to avoid crowded public places where close contact with others may occur. These might include movie theaters, religious gatherings, and crowded restaurants. Of course, it’s not always easy to practice social distancing. In many cases, governments and businesses have decided to close in order to prevent such gatherings from happening at all.
 
If you live alone, social-distancing may be easier for you in many ways. You won’t be exposed to as many people if you don’t have other family members coming and going. Yet it can also present some challenges for you.
 
You may need to ensure that you’re not becoming too isolated. Loneliness and depression can become a real problem if you don’t interact with others. So if you’ve started working from home, avoiding social gatherings, and you’re not going out much, then make sure to monitor your mental health.
 Check in with friends and family regularly so you can keep some social contact with others. Speak with them on the phone, text throughout the day, or set up video calls to ensure that you aren’t getting too isolated. 
Social distancing isn’t just something you should practice during a pandemic. It’s something you may want to do any time your immune system is compromised.
 
You might also practice it if there are other illnesses in your community. An outbreak of influenza, for example, may be reduced if people reduced their contact with one another.
 
Staying calm during a pandemic can seem impossible. But, managing your stress and anxiety in a healthy way is important so you can make the best decisions possible.
 
While social distancing may seem like a drastic step to take, it’s just a precautionary measure. And if you’re practicing it, there’s still a good chance you are healthy. Otherwise, you may be placed into a quarantine situation.
 
Think of social distancing as a proactive extra precaution to keep yourself and your family safe. If you have children, explain to them that you’re doing this as a way to keep everyone healthy. If you panic, your kids will likely get anxious, so make it clear that this is just another step you’re taking to help the family and the community.
 While it’s important to stay informed on the latest news, take care of yourself by limiting your exposure to the media. If you are spending a lot more time at home and around your television, this can be difficult, but constantly watching media reports of new outbreaks and deaths can raise your anxiety during a time when it’s important to stay calm. Try to find other more enjoyable activities around your home that can help take your mind off the situation, even if that means spending some time watching Netflix instead of the news.

Anti-racism is a process of actively identifying and opposing racism. The goal of anti-racism is to challenge racism and actively change the policies, behaviors, and beliefs that perpetuate racist ideas and actions.
 
Anti-racism is rooted in action. It is about taking steps to eliminate racism at the individual, institutional, and structural levels. It is not a new concept, but the Black Lives Matter movement has helped increase the focus on the importance of anti-racism.
 
The problem with systemic racism is that it is all around us. We are born into it. It is deeply embedded in our culture and our communities including our schools, the justice system, the government, and hospitals. It is so pervasive that people often don't even notice how policies, institutions, and systems disproportionately favor some while disadvantaging others.
 
People often mistakenly believe that simply being “not racist” is enough to eliminate racial discrimination. The problem with this perspective is that white people are often unaware of their own unconscious biases. People often don’t fully understand the institutional and structural issues that uphold white supremacy and contribute to racist behaviors, attitudes, and policies.
 
Saying “but I’m not racist” also allows people to avoid participating in anti-racism. It’s a way of saying “that’s not my problem” while failing to acknowledge that even people who are not racist still reap the benefits of a system that is biased against other people.
 
Another problem is that research has found that people who believe that they are not racist are often much more prejudiced than they think they are. One study found that people who described themselves as believing strongly in racial equality tended to have significant implicit biases against Black people.﻿﻿
 
In his book How to Be an AntiRacist, Ibram X. Kendi, a leading scholar on race and racial discrimination, examines many of the individual attitudes held by both white and non-white people that play a role in sustaining racism. It is impossible, Kendi notes, to be “not racist” if you hold negative attitudes about entire groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage. 
 It is the casual, insidious forms of racism that people are often blind to that play such a pivotal role in upholding racism. People don’t see it because these attitudes are often so deeply ingrained that it takes the ability to be deeply self-critical to examine and challenge those attitudes. 
As Kendi explains in How to Be an Antiracist: ""The only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it — and then dismantle it.""
 
People often think of racism solely in terms of individual actions. The word may conjure up images of people in white cloaks or neo-Nazi’s with shaved heads. While both represent racism, it is important to realize that racial discrimination is not always so overt.
 
Believing that racism is always so direct blinds us from recognizing and examining our own biased beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.
 
For example, Merriam-Webster dictionary defined racism as, “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.” In the wake of the George Floyd protests, editors of the dictionary decided to update the definition in response to one reader’s request to more clearly include the role that systemic racism plays.﻿﻿ 
 
Kendi suggests that a racist is “One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea.""﻿﻿
 
Anti-racism also involves working to understand how race and racism affect people. Research has shown that racism has wide-reaching negative effects on individuals, families, communities, and entire societies. Racism has an impact in areas you may not have considered including healthcare, education, employment, and housing. 
 
Racism influences economic status for a number of reasons. Racialized individuals are discriminated against in educational and employment access. For example:
 
Ethnic minorities are less likely to be offered jobs compared to their white counterparts. Black workers are twice as likely to be unemployed as white workers. Statistics also show that Black employees are more likely to be underemployed in comparison to their educational and skill levels.﻿﻿
 
Statistics show that there are significant disparities in how the criminal justice and legal system treats white vs. non-white defendants. People who belong to an ethnic minority receive longer, harsher sentences. For example, Black men receive almost 20% longer sentences than white defendants for the same crimes.﻿﻿ 
 
Racial discrimination has a detrimental impact on health for a number of reasons. Research has shown that racism has negative effects on physical and mental health. Studies have also found that BIPOC are less likely to receive adequate healthcare, both because of reduced access to healthcare and because of poor patient experiences.﻿﻿
 
Understanding these issues as well as how systemic racism contributes to such disparities is an essential part of anti-racism. Redlining, which is the systematic denial of services, is one reason for the significant disparities in homeownership. Racial minorities are less likely to be offered financial services including loans and insurance. They are also less likely to be shown available homes for sale.﻿﻿
 
They are less likely to receive job offers and are frequently paid less than their non-racialized counterparts for the same work. All of these factors — as well as many others — contribute to the social and economic disparities that are indicative of widespread systemic racism.
 
Anti-racism requires looking at your own beliefs and actions critically. Research has shown that even people who support racial equality often unknowingly hold racist attitudes. This discrepancy is often explained by the existence of implicit biases, or attitudes that are largely unconscious but nevertheless influence behavior. For example:
 
These unconscious, automatic associations are a result of how the brain operates. In order to make sense of a complex world that inundates us with information, our brains like to create categories and shortcuts that help us make sense of the world. The problem is that these shortcuts can lead us astray, causing bias and making it difficult to think critically.
 While it is impossible to rid yourself of your cognitive biases entirely, it is possible to develop critical thinking skills that allow you to challenge your assumptions.  
If you are interested in learning more about your own implicit biases, you can take the Implicit Association Test free through Project Implicit.
 
Kendi explains that anti-racism requires the ability to examine your own biases and engage in critical thinking. The events that helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement have helped many see the critical need for anti-racism. Ijeoma Oluo, the author of So You Want to Talk About Race, described the essence of anti-racism:
 
Do the research to learn about the history and effects of racism. Learn how racism is still happening today and how it shapes our social, economic, and political landscape. There are many great ways to learn more about the history and effects of racism including books and online resources, including:
 
Listen to what racial justice advocates have to say about racist behaviors and policies. Remember that just because you have never experienced or witnessed these things doesn’t mean that they don’t happen. Reflect on things you may have done or believed that might have been rooted in racism.
 
Also recognize that race intersects with many other aspects of a person’s identity including sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, and disability. Not all people are impacted by race in the same way. Black women, for example, are affected by both racial discrimination and sexism. And Black and Indigenous people often experience discrimination differently than other people of color.
 
Listening to these experiences and thinking about how policies may affect people differently can help people adopt an anti-racist stance.
 
Take part in events that are designed to combat racial injustice. Steps you can take to help make a difference include:
 Work to make changes in any setting where you have the power to do so. Use your position and voice to effect change in your workplace, your school, your community, and your local government. 
Talk to friends and family about the effects of racism. Call out racism when you see it. Posting your support on social media can be helpful, but real conversations with the people in your life can often be more influential and effective.
 
Opening up a conversation about race and racism with your kids is an essential part of raising kids to be anti-racist. Staying away from conversations about race and skin color can lead kids to think that such topics are bad or taboo. It also leaves kids to draw their own conclusions based on the often stereotyped representations they see in the media. 
 
Adding multicultural books to your child’s reading list can be helpful. Books can also be helpful for guiding conversations about difficult topics such as slavery and segregation.
 
One way to combat racist beliefs is to seek diversity in your life. It’s hard to gain a new perspective if all you do is spend time with people who look like you, think like you, and act like you. It is also hard to learn about other people if the media you consume only reflects people who are similar to you.
 
One study found that simply living in areas with greater diversity cause people to be less racist and more tolerant.﻿﻿ This phenomenon, known as passive tolerance, happens because people are exposed to more positive examples. Rather than basing beliefs on racial stereotypes, people gain a more representative and realistic perspective through direct experience.
 
Because anti-racism is an active process, it has the potential to have an impact on the individual, community, and societal levels. 
 
Some of the potential effects include:
 It is important to remember that anti-racism is not a one-time or occasional action. It’s a lifelong commitment to fighting for racial equality and justice. 
Anti-racism requires reflection and action. It involves looking not only at your own beliefs and behaviors, but also fighting racism on the interpersonal, institutional, and structural levels. Being anti-racist is a conscious choice to make choices and engage in actions that support equality. 
 White households are on average 13 times wealthier than Black households.﻿﻿ One 2016 report found that while 72% of white households owned their home, only 45% of Black households and 44% of Latino households owned their homes.﻿﻿ Black bachelor’s degree-holders earn significantly less than white bachelor's degree holders. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019 the median pay for white workers was 28% higher than it was for Black and Latino workers.﻿﻿ While people may consciously support racial justice, they can still hold subtle beliefs about different races, often based upon internalized stereotypes.  Data from the Implicit Association Test (IAT) has found that while nearly 70% of white respondents claim that they have no preference between black and white, almost the same percentage of respondents showed some type of preference toward whites on the test.﻿﻿ Such biases can have an impact on behavior. One study found that having implicit racial biases made doctors less likely to recommend appropriate treatment to Black patients.﻿﻿ How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X.

As the nation wrestles with institutional racism and attempts to heal from the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Elijah McClain, Rayshard Brooks, and countless others, many Americans are left wondering what they can do to help. While tens of thousands have joined the protests in the streets, not everyone has the ability to participate in such a physically demanding and time-consuming way, especially with the coronavirus still posing a threat.
 
What's more, protests and information campaigns on social media only go so far in addressing the change that needs to take place. While they are extremely useful in raising awareness, they do not have a long-term impact on change.
 Consequently, if you're passionate about the cause and are committed to making sure the country moves forward, there are countless other ways you can lend your support. 
From volunteering and donating money to supporting Black-owned businesses and getting educated, there are a lot of options open to you. Here is an overview of how you can get involved. Keep in mind though that this list is just a tiny representation of the organizations that need your help. Use this list as a starting point, but be on the lookout for more ways to be an ally.
 
One of the most obvious ways to support people of color and work to end systemic racism is to offer financial assistance to those who have been impacted by the violence as well as those who have been arrested for taking a stand. Here are some ways in which you can support various organizations and funds financially.
 
Donations to these organizations go toward paying the bail or bond in order to release protestors jailed in the United States. If you would like to make a donation in a city or state not listed below, check out the National Bail Fund Network, which lists funds you can donate to in all states that utilize bail or bond systems.
 
Donations to these organizations go toward supporting the recent victims of violence. Clearly, there are a number of additional victim organizations. So, if there is one that you are looking for, you can probably find it by
 
Whether you volunteer your time, give financially, or both, there are countless organizations working tirelessly to bring about change in this country both locally and nationally.
 
Here is an overview of some of the community organizations and policy-reform groups that are working not only to advance the lives of people of color, but also to end systemic racism, bring about change, and end racial injustice. This is not an exhaustive list, so be sure to keep your eyes and ears open for other ways to bring about change in your community.
 
Donations made to these groups help bring change to communities throughout the country. These groups work to create programs that encourage education, advancement, and opportunities for Black and brown people.
 
Donations to these organizations go toward helping these groups implement legislative efforts designed to overturn systemically racist policies across the nation.
 
Learning how to be a helpful ally requires that you have difficult conversations with your friends of color. Knowing how to listen—even when what they have to say is hard or difficult to hear—is the first step toward lasting change.
 As activists have said, it's not enough to be ""not racist."" Instead, you need to be ""actively anti-racist."" When this happens, you will be taking those first steps toward social and economic change in a society that is riddled with systemic racism. 
Another way to educate yourself is to read books that deal with racism in order to learn more about racism and to protest history that is not shared adequately. Likewise, you can watch documentaries to learn more about issues like mass incarceration.
 
Finally, check out Letters for Black Lives, which is a multilingual resource aimed at creating opportunities for open and honest conversations about racial justice, police violence, and anti-blackness in our communities. The letters on their site are thought-provoking and created to be conversation starters.
 
During the pandemic, it's important to support local businesses, but it's especially important to support Black-owned businesses. The owners often have trouble securing loans and often are overlooked when it comes to federal aid. To find businesses in your area, try accessing the directories listed below.
 
For people who cannot donate or protest, you can always volunteer your time and energy. Consider your strengths, passions, and profession to see if you're naturally equipped to provide a service to protestors and civil rights groups. For instance, some people have made masks for protestors while others have offered to provide childcare.
 
Meanwhile, some volunteers have made food for protestors while others have offered their medical expertise and first aid skills to those who have been sprayed with tear gas or hit with rubber bullets. Lawyers also are needed to help provide legal assistance to those who are arrested. No matter what your profession is or your passion, there are probably ways in which you can volunteer.
 
When it comes to addressing systemic racism and bringing about change in this country, the first step is getting everyone involved and engaged. No matter what your personal situation is or your limitations, there are always for you to engage, get involved, and to support change not only in your local community but also in the nation as a whole.
 
Look for ways to become educated about issues facing people of color and have those difficult conversations with your friends, family, and neighbors. Together, the people in this country can bring about change and create an environment that is truly equitable for every person regardless of their race or station in life.
 The Bail Project: This national revolving bail fund is dedicated to combat mass incarceration. What's more, 100% of online donations are used to bring people home. Additionally, the money comes back to the organization when the cases close, so they are able to recycle every dollar donated at least twice a year. National Bail Out: This is a Black-led and Black-centered group of lawyers, organizers, and activists that are working to end mass incarceration. Donations help them bail-out community members and provide supportive services. Chicago Community Bond Fund: This organization pays the bond for people charged with crimes in Cook County, Illinois. They maintain that people who are unable to pay bonds have higher rates of incarceration, longer sentences, loss of housing and jobs, separation from their families, and loss of custody. They also advocate bringing an end to bail bonds. Atlanta Solidarity Fund: This fund supports people in Atlanta who have been arrested for taking action against social injustice. What's more, they are focused primarily on bailing out arrestees and give priority to those with the greatest financial need. Elijah McClain Memorial Fund: Organized by his mother, Sheneen McClain, this fund is in honor of Elijah who was a 23-year old who went into a coma and died after being placed in a chokehold by Aurora Police in Colorado last August. I Run With Maud: This fund was created to assist Ahmaud's mother and her immediate family with financial support as they struggle to bring justice for his murder. Arbery was chased and gunned down by several men in the community. They claim to have witnessed a burglary. However, there has been no evidence of a burglary. George Floyd Memorial Fund: This fund, which was established by Floyd's brother, is designed to assist with funeral expenses, grief counseling, mental health counseling, and lodging and travel for all court proceedings. It also will be used to assist the family as they seek justice for Floyd. Justice for Breonna Taylor: This fund was set up by a family member of Breonna Taylor, who was killed when police broke down her door with a battering ram to execute a ""no-knock"" search warrant. They suspected that two suspects had used her apartment to sell drugs, but no drugs were found in the search. David McAtee Memorial Fund: Known as Yaya or the BBQ Man by those in his community, David McAtee was a local restaurant owner that was shot and killed by authorities in Kentucky. Donations will be given to the family to assist with funeral experiences and to fund any legal action needed as they fight for justice. Black and Brown Founders: The goal of this organization is to provide community, education, and access for Black and Latinx entrepreneurs, which allows them to build and launch their tech businesses with modest resources. Their support allows business-minded people of color to launch startups without relying on venture capital. Black Girls Code: This organization strives to assist young and pre-teen girls of color in learning in-demand skills in technology and computer programming while they are still thinking about what they want to do when they grow up. This mission is accomplished by reaching out to communities through school programs and workshops.  Harriet Tubman Collective: This collective consists of Black deaf and disabled organizers, community builders, and activists that are working toward racial inclusion and liberation. Their goal is to elevate the experiences and leadership of the most marginalized Black people. Embrace Race: This multiracial organization is comprised of parents, teachers, experts and other caring adults who support one another in addressing the challenges of race. Embrace Race identifies, organizes, and creates tools, resources, and discussion spaces designed to meet the organization's four goals. These goals include nurturing resilience in children of color, being empathetic and inclusive of children of all stripes, raising kids to think critically about racial inequity, and supporting a movement of racial justice advocates. SoGal: As the largest global platform for education and empowerment of diverse investors and entrepreneurs, SoGal works to close the gap in entrepreneurship and venture capital. With more than 250 events a year, they offer a plethora of training and educational opportunities to help people of color succeed in their business endeavors. American Civil Liberties Union: Through its racial justice program the ACLU strives to preserve and extend constitutionally guaranteed rights to people who have historically been denied their rights on the basis of race.

In a large-scale, multi-country study looking at cardiovascular disease and depressive symptoms, researchers found a strong link between the two. Those with depression were much more likely to have cardiovascular events and early mortality compared to those who had heart issues but no depressive symptoms.
 
Published in JAMA Psychiatry,  the research covered 21 countries and just over 145,000 participants, tracked over a period of 14 years, in both urban and rural communities.﻿﻿ The more symptoms of depression participants had, the higher their risk was for multiple types of cardiovascular issues, regardless of geography.
 
This adds to previous research connecting cardiovascular function and mental health concerns. A study in JAMA Network Open published in February, involving over 500,000 people in China, also found that depression is a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in adults, particularly men.﻿﻿
 
There are many theories about why this connection may exist, from changes in inflammation levels to the possibility that those with depression may not practice as much heart-healthy self-care strategies like healthy eating, keeping stress levels low, exercising, and maintaining social connections—which have all been linked to heart health.
 Research continues to support the idea that mental health is health, and that taking care of your mind is just as important as caring for your body. By working on one, you can help the other to increase your overall health. 
Although using the terms ""mental health"" and ""physical health"" implies these are two distinct, separate aspects to wellness, the recent study highlights how they can be deeply interconnected. In addition to cardiovascular issues, conditions like depression and anxiety are often associated with:﻿﻿
 
In terms of emotional or mental effects, the American Psychiatric Association defines depression symptoms as including:
 
Estimates suggest major depressive disorder is very common, and affects between 6% and 18% of the world population.﻿﻿
 
""When it comes to addressing mental health issues, there can unfortunately still be a degree of stigma involved, even if there are physical symptoms,"" says Cheryl Carmin, PhD, psychologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.
 ""Knowing that you may be affected both physically and mentally is helpful for trying to understand what's going on, and seeking appropriate treatment."" 
Often, health changes seem to go in one direction: You address physical symptoms or make lifestyle tweaks, and your mental health improves. For instance, you might start exercising regularly to get more energy and maintain your weight, and then find your mood improves as well.
 
But it's also possible for those benefits to go in the other direction as well. By focusing on your mental wellbeing, you may see physical advantages as a side effect. For example, recent research in JAMA Psychiatry found that several types of therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, resulted in significantly enhanced immune system function that stayed robust for at least six months after treatment.﻿﻿
 
""Mental and emotional issues can affect physiological reactions, and that goes both ways,"" says Ian Sadler, PhD, psychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. ""For example, we often see people with compromised immune function and chronic health problems facing mental health challenges. Addressing physical health will have an impact on mental well-being, and vice versa.""
 
If you find yourself struggling with emotional and mental health challenges and experiencing signs of depression—which may manifest as physical symptoms like fatigue, chronic pain, headaches, and stomach pain—talk with your primary care physician or another healthcare provider for appropriate referrals. You may be able to do telehealth sessions with a therapist or counselor, even as a new patient.
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.  For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. A recent study found a link between depression and a higher risk of heart issues. These findings underscore the strength of the relationship between mental and physical health, which includes other disease risks as well.

The Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) recently released new clinical guidelines suggesting all adolescent and adult women should be screened for anxiety as a way to improve early detection to provide earlier diagnosis and treatment if necessary and boost overall health as a result.﻿﻿
 
WPSI is a national coalition of women's health professional organizations and patient representatives, and provides recommendations intended to guide best practices for physicians and other healthcare providers, namely in the primary care setting. The group developed these new suggestions after evaluating available screening tools and gauging the harm of undiagnosed anxiety in teens and adult women.
 
The 27 screening tools they evaluated ranged from good to moderate to poor for accurately identifying anxiety, and the 33 studies that were reviewed found that symptoms improved and relapse rates were lowered with better screening and treatment methods.﻿﻿
 This doesn't suggest all women have anxiety, but rather, that early intervention and detection of anxiety or other mental health conditions means that a person will be treated sooner. 
Additionally, many women may be facing more potential stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2020 study found men are increasing the amount of time spent doing housework and homeschooling, but that women still do the largest share of those tasks, potentially along with professional responsibilities and elder care as well.﻿﻿
 You or a loved one may not be concerned about anxiety, but your doctor may follow these guidelines and screen you nonetheless. Preventive mental health care is just as important as any other preventive care, and these accurate screening methods can give you a head start on treatment for a condition that may have otherwise been overlooked. 
Although the WPSI recommendation highlighted the importance of anxiety screening for women, this type of mental health check-in can be a benefit for everybody, says Cheryl Carmin, PhD, a professor of clinical psychology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Because of COVID-19 related pressures—homeschooling, potential job loss, and deep uncertainty about what's ahead—anxiety levels have been spiking as a result.
 Research reports indicate that prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications rose 34% from mid-February to mid-March. During the week ending March 15—when stay-at-home orders began taking effect—about 78% of all antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and anti-insomnia medications were new prescriptions.﻿﻿ 
Rising anxiety isn't just for adults—children are susceptible as well. Another 2020 study tracked the effects of the stay-at-home orders on students in grades 2 through 6 in China. Among the 2,330 children who were surveyed, researchers found a 19% increase in levels of anxiety and a 23% increase in symptoms of depression.﻿﻿ This means that parents everywhere may want to ask their pediatricians about mental health screening for their kids as well.
 
As is the case with any health condition, early detection can help prevent issues from becoming chronic. But for mental health concerns, that means getting through the stigma first.﻿﻿
 Everyone, at every level, has been thrown out of what was once certain and predictable, and put into a situation with uncertainty and ambiguity. The brain doesn't operate well with unpredictability, especially long-term. That's led many people who haven't dealt with anxiety before to have that become an issue for them. Screening for that can help address this, and give them strategies and tools for coping. 
If there's a bright side to the pandemic, it's been the rise of telehealth, says Jennifer Gentile, PsyD, an attending psychologist in the Division of Endocrinology at Boston Children's Hospital, who treats some patients virtually using a telehealth app.
 
Because of widespread stay-at-home orders, more insurance companies have been open to covering the costs of telehealth services,﻿﻿ and many healthcare providers that didn't have that service in place quickly moved to offering appointments remotely. That has included mental health services, even for new patients.
 
As employers recognize the need to have these resources available, there's also been a mini-boom in comprehensive apps focused on mental health, such as Lyra Health and Talkspace, which connect you with licensed professionals and are increasingly offered by employers. There are also self-help apps designed for individuals as well, like Anxiety Reliever, AnxietyCoach, and Happify.
 
Being able to stay in a comfortable, familiar environment like home while addressing anxiety concerns may lead more people to give screening and therapy a try, Gentile says.
 
If you find yourself struggling with emotional and mental health challenges and experiencing signs of anxiety and/or depression—which can also manifest as physical symptoms like fatigue, chronic pain, headaches, and stomach pain—talk with your primary care physician or other healthcare provider for appropriate referrals.
 
You may be able to do telehealth sessions with a therapist or counselor, even as a new patient.

Sneaking the occasional cigarette has greater health consequences than most people may realize. A new study published in 2020 in JAMA Network Open found that even low levels of cigarette smoking is hazardous. In fact, smoking just 6 to 10 cigarettes per month can still increase your risk of death and disease.﻿﻿
 
To determine the mortality risks facing nondaily smokers, the researchers, which included Maki Inoue-Choi, PhD, MS, RD, a staff scientist at the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer and Epidemiology, looked at tobacco use and health outcomes for roughly 505,500 U.S. adults between 1992 and 2011, including daily and nondaily users. The daily users, they found, smoked a mean of 20 cigarettes per day (600 cigarettes per month), and the lifelong nondaily smokers typically smoked 40 cigarettes per month.﻿﻿
 
Based on their findings, both daily and nondaily smokers had substantially higher mortality risks than people who have never smoked. And more specifically, Inoue-Choi and her colleagues found that daily smokers had 2.32 times higher mortality risk, and lifelong nondaily smokers had 1.82 times higher mortality risk than those who never smoked at all.﻿﻿
 Smoking is responsible for nearly half a million deaths in the United States every year. Despite decades-long efforts to curb smoking rates, an estimated 34 million Americans currently smoke cigarettes, and millions live with smoking-related conditions.﻿﻿ 
“This study makes clear, again, the fact that there is no safe level of tobacco use,” says pulmonologist Andrew Martin, MD, FCCP, Chair, Pulmonary Medicine at Deborah Heart and Lung Center in New Jersey.
 There is no threshold below which smoking cigarettes does not cause harm, and it remains true that cigarette smoking kills more people than all other drugs legal or illegal, HIV, motor vehicle accidents, and firearm-related incidents combined. 
For Herman Gaztambide-Rodriguez, MD, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Orlando Health in Florida, this study is a reminder of the importance of reaching the population (nondaily smokers) who are only sneaking a cigarette here or there with the false belief that a few cigarettes can’t really be harmful. “This is the group that believes that smoking a few cigarettes once a week cannot be the same as smoking daily,” he explains.
 
But the study, says Gaztambide-Rodriguez, is showing that even the nondaily smokers are not exempt from the complications that daily smokers face. “Right out of the gate, you’ve doubled your mortality risk just by being a nondaily smoker,” he says. He specifically points out the increased cancer risk: “If you come from a family with a heavy cancer history and you’re sneaking occasional cigarettes, you are at risk,” he adds.
 Of course, experts do stress that reducing cigarette use does have a positive effect on your health. Based on the new data, researchers determined that nondaily smokers who were daily smokers had lower mortality risks compared with daily smokers. But, their risk is still elevated, which supports the public health recommendations that there is no safe level of smoking. 
According to the authors of the study, the strongest associations for cigarette smoking among both nondaily and daily smokers were observed for deaths from lung cancer and respiratory disease. They also noted deaths from cardiovascular and other diseases, but these were not as prevalent as lung cancer and respiratory disease.﻿﻿
 
Compared with never-smokers, the researchers identified risks for smoking-related cancers that were 2.16 times higher in lifelong nondaily smokers, 3.65 times higher in nondaily smokers who had previously been daily smokers, and 4.88 times higher in daily smokers.﻿﻿ Moreover, when looking specifically at lung cancer, these risks increased substantially.
 The health consequences of smoking tobacco are well-known and include increased risk for heart, lung, and vascular disease, which all cause not only death, but often years of shortness of breath, discomfort, disability, and pain. 
Plus, all smokers are also at increased risk for multiple types of cancer, including lung, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancer, among others.﻿﻿
 
Another significant finding from this study was the association of reducing the level of smoking from daily to nondaily with mortality risks. In examining daily smokers who became nondaily smokers, researchers noted a decreased mortality risk after 10 years of reduction.﻿﻿ This required participants to substantially reduce their monthly cigarette consumption.
 
That said, the mortality risks remained substantially greater than both never- and former smokers, which points to the importance of smoking cessation beyond even substantial reductions in cigarette smoking.
 
“The most effective smoking cessation strategy starts with a decision to become a non-smoker,” says Martin. For his patients, Martin advises them to treat smoking cessation as if they are approaching surgery.
 
“A date should be scheduled at which time the patient will get rid of all the cigarettes they have in their possession, and once that plan has been made, they should discuss with their physician the use of products that may make it easier to quit by decreasing withdrawal symptoms,” he explains.
 
Martin says products may include nicotine (various forms), varenicline (Chantix), or bupropion (Zyban or Wellbutrin).﻿﻿ While effective, Martin reminds his patients that these medicines decrease, but do not eliminate, nicotine withdrawal symptoms. “So, just as if they have had surgery, patients should expect to suffer a bit after they stop smoking,” he adds.
 
And Gaztambide-Rodriguez agrees. “I’m always honest with my patients about the monumental task of smoking cessation. The body gets really addicted to nicotine, and quitting is not easy,” says Gaztambide-Rodriguez. That’s why not giving up is the right answer. “Very few people quit successfully their first try, which shows how ugly the addiction is,” he says.
 
Support groups, which include family, friends, and other groups, definitely help,﻿﻿ along with newer medications like nicotine replacement, but Gaztambide-Rodriguez says there is no magic bullet. “These are all excellent additions to a smoking cessation program, but any one of these on their own is not the answer,” he adds. Instead, a combination of all possible treatments, and knowing what it means not to quit is the key. “I don’t think there is a better way to solve this.""
 Researchers found a significant increase in mortality and disease risk in nondaily smokers vs. non-smokers. A family history of certain conditions can put nondaily smokers at an even higher risk.﻿﻿ Cutting back from daily smoking does decrease risks, but long-term total cessation is recommended.
